"COVID-19 FAQ (a work-in-progress) This is not a megathread.  You can still post questions if they are not addressed here. If they are addressed here, your post will be locked and you'll be directed here instead.  Please read it all the way through before posting your question.

**Important:  If your post was removed and you were directed here, and your specific question is not answered, it means there is no answer anyone here can provide for you at the moment, or your question is simply too location and/or fact specific for us to provide any useful information.  Please do not modmail us with ""but my question wasn't answered in the FAQ.""  If it was removed, there is simply no other help we can provide you at this time.**

This is the best information we have at the moment and a number of different mods and contributors assisted with gathering information.  

To the best of our ability, we are updating it as new information becomes available.

READ THIS QUESTION AND THE ANSWER FIRST:

* **Any question that ends with something to the effect of ""is this legal?""  or ""this must be illegal, what can I do?""**

The courts are now closed in many areas, so the answer is ""nothing right now.""  Nobody is going to be hearing requests for immediate relief on most civil matters.

If you're receiving an ultimatum from your employer, *whether it's working at all, or not working from home, or working without proper gear, or working at risk of exposure*, you will have to make a decision whether to follow it or not.  If you don't comply with what the employer wants, yes, they can fire you.  We cannot tell you right now if it's possible you'll have a lawsuit or other remedy later on.  We don't know.  Nobody knows.  We are in an unprecedented situation, and it will not only depend on how the law develops but also very fact-specific inquires.

We can tell you this:

~ If you are sick, stay home.  Stay home even if you are well except for essential activities.

~ If you are fired or laid off, file for unemployment immediately, and online if at all possible.

~ If you are non-exempt, you must be paid for all hours worked.  You can file for back pay with the proper agency once its open again.

~ If your employer allows you to work from home, you cannot be required to use sick, vacation, or other PTO. 

~ Many states are pausing all evictions and foreclosures.  Check Google for state-specific information.

* **What can you tell us about the recent federal legislation?**

[Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) (Sick/family leave)

[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) (Cash payments, unemployment expansions, tenant relief, etc.)

* **Where can I find information on COVID-19 related unemployment questions?**

You can find a link to the FAQs provided by all 50 states [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/g8la5x/links_to_state_unemployment_faqs_on_covid19/?).

* **I was laid off or furloughed and I'm collecting unemployment.  If I refuse to return to work when called back by my employer, will I lose my unemployment benefits?**

It depends on your state's specific rules, but generally, the answer is yes.  Unemployment benefits are contingent on your being willing and able to work.  If you refuse work, you may lose your benefits.  

If you are asked to return but your reason for refusing to return is fear of COVID-19, you would most likely have to point so a specific practice or practices of your employer's to justify it.  Just a general fear is unlikely to be sufficient.

The requirement to accept work if offered is different from the requirement to actively look for new work, which has been temporarily suspended. 

It's possible you might be eligible for some other kind of protected or paid leave after you return (you must go back to work to be eligible).  See our page on the [FFCRA](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) for information on family leave and paid sick leave.

* **Can I be denied entry to a business or fired if I have a physical or mental condition that makes wearing a mask uncomfortable or impossible for me?**

Probably. You can be denied accommodation under the ADA if you represent a direct threat to other users of a public accomodation under § 36.208(a) Direct threat.

&gt;(a) This part does not require a public accommodation to permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that public accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.

The same doctrine would apply to employers, though it is codified separately under § 1630.2(r):

&gt;""[a] significant risk of substantial harm to health or safety of self or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.""

While no courts have yet ruled on this issue in the context of the present COVID pandemic, it is likely that failure to comply constitutes a prima facie direct threat for the purposes of both of these statutes.

* **I'm furloughed but my employer expects us to work for free from home/at the workplace.**

Your employer must pay you for all hours worked.  It is not legal at any time to expect you to work for free.  If your employer fires you for refusing to work for free, you can make a complaint to whatever entity handles wage and hour complaints in your state (which in some states is the federal Department of Labor).

* **If I wasn't required to file a tax return for 2018 or 2019, can I still get a stimulus payment?**

Yes, if you otherwise qualify for a payment.  If you aren't required to file a tax return, you can [fill out this form on the IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here).  If you are required to file (for example, because your gross income exceeded $12,200 single/$24,400 married) you must file a return instead of using the form. 

Please check [the page on the CARES Act] (https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) for other information on this legislation.

* **Can I do this/that/whatever under my state's stay at home order?**

[Here is a useful roundup and links to the orders in all 50 states.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/06/coronavirus-stay-at-home-by-state/)  (There is no paywall at the moment.)

Keep in mind that just because you CAN do something that doesn't mean you should.  Stay home means stay home.  It's for everyone's safety, and the more that everyone complies, the sooner these orders can be lifted.  

* **Can I be forced to use PTO before a furlough/layoff?  Must PTO be paid out prior to a PTO furlough/layoff?**

We do not know of any state that prohibits employers from requiring employees to use PTO or vacation time at the beginning of or prior to a furlough/layoff. In other words, if your boss tells you that you are being furloughed but first you are required to use up your PTO/vacation time, then you are probably stuck.

However, if you are eligible to use leave provided by the Families First Act, your employer cannot require you to use other leave prior to using the FFA leave. Worth noting: If you are laid off, you are probably not eligible for FFA leave.

The trickier question is whether employers are required to pay out accrued PTO/vacation banks when furloughing/laying off employees. It is tricky because 1) some states require payout of PTO/vacation upon termination, and some don't; and 2) some states may distinguish between a layoff and a termination, and some don't. As an example, California requires payout of PTO/vacation time for layoffs longer than 10 days or without a fixed return date. Most other states are less generous toward employees.

* **Is my employer/job considered ""essential?""**

Except for the obvious, we don't know.  Check your particular state, city, or county's order (here is [the California order,](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/EssentialCriticalInfrastructureWorkers.pdf?te=1&amp;nl=california-today&amp;emc=edit_ca_20200323&amp;campaign_id=49&amp;instance_id=16995&amp;segment_id=22614&amp;user_id=d976d65d78d90cea1530af9fd4ae893f&amp;regi_id=7886865120200323) for example).  Please see the previous answer for ""what if I'm not essential and my employer still wants me to work?""

If you believe a business is staying open illegally, you can contact whomever the state, city, or county has designated for such reports.  In the absence of that information, contact whomever provides that business with a business license or other certification required to operate -- exactly who that is will depend on the type of business.

* **Can my employer reduce my pay?**

Generally, yes.  For nonexempt (generally hourly) workers, it can be reduced to minimum wage in your state/locality.

For exempt (generally salaried) workers, it can be reduced as long as it doesn't go below the legal floor.  Under the FLSA, that's $35,568 per year.  But your state may have more stringent requirements as the minimum salary is tied to minimum wage, which varies by state.  So check the minimum salary for exempt workers in your state.  Here is [some information](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-updates/pages/employers-must-review-state-overtime-exemption-rules.aspx), but it does not cover every state.

* **Is my employer legally required to tell us if a co-worker has had a positive COVID-19 test?**

As far as we can tell, there is no legal obligation for the employer to inform other employees of a positive COVID-19 test or diagnosis.  Best practice seems to be to inform but not identify, but this is not a legal obligation.  At this point, we should all be behaving as if every person we come into contact with is infected.

* **I'm still working.  Can my employer take or require me to take my temperature before starting my shift?**

Yes, via infrared, oral, ear, or other non-invasive means, and they aren't required to have a doctor or nurse do this. 

* **I'm a health care worker and I was fired for speaking out about the lack of PPE at my facility.**

Start [here](https://www.osha.gov/whistleblower/WBComplaint.html).

* **I have something due/a date at a court/with the DMV/some other agency?**

Check the relevant web site.  They are probably granting extensions.

* **I have a custody/visitation problem.**

Many jurisdictions are issuing specific blanket orders that parents are to adhere to the existing schedule whether or not school is in session; some jurisdictions have issued other blanket orders as well.  You should check the website of the family court where your order was issued before doing anything else.  For child support/garnishment issues, check the web site of the entity that handles those issues in your state.

With respect to other issues, ordinarily, we would tell you that in the absence of a modification or emergency order, you obey the order in hand unless the child is in imminent danger.

Right now there may be no way to modify an order or to seek an emergency order.  Our best advice is that parents should act like adults in the time of a national emergency, and work it out, keeping in mind that this is not about winning or losing a battle with the other person, but what is best for your child.

Do NOT call 911 for custody disputes unless a crime has been committed or someone is in imminent physical danger.  These are not police emergencies.

If you cannot work it out and you are the one facing disobeying a court order, you need to have a very, very good explanation for it.  ""I don't feel safe with my child with the other parent"" is not a good explanation.  ""We were under a mandatory shelter in place order and couldn't drive 30 miles to the custody handoff"" might be.

The available evidence is that COVID-19 is not particularly dangerous to young children *who aren't immunocompromised* or otherwise particularly vulnerable. Most likely judges will not look kindly on people who violate custody orders because they disagree with their co-parent about degrees of COVID-19 protection *when the dispute relates solely to the health of the otherwise healthy children.*

In general, if whatever dispute you have eventually ends up in court, whichever party acted unreasonably can expect no mercy from the judge.

* **Is x a COVID-19 related scam?**

Numerous scams are popping up.  Use appropriate caution.  [FTC page](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/features/coronavirus-scams-what-ftc-doing).

* **Are curfew/stay home/shelter in place orders by the mayor/governor legal?**

The Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. § 264, gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to take measures to limit and prevent the spread of infectious disease. While laws vary state to state in language and scope, every state has an analogous law that allows authorities to impose quarantine and other restrictive measures; this power does not include tribal lands.

* **Some business/person is not obeying a shelter in place/stay home order.  What can I do?**

This is very location-specific.  You can try 311 in your city/county, or Google to see if your jurisdiction has designated a specific office to take such reports (the City of Los Angeles, for example, requests reports [on this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCy18l51yeciH_bL2InvGfc1Xo6IVHXTDYGFvpx8GnLzxCIA/viewform)).  Do NOT call 911 as this is not a police emergency.

* **The CDC/Governor/Some other official recommended that people over 65 self-isolate.  I'm over 65.  Can I be fired if I don't go to work?**

As a practical matter... yes.  Your employer can fire you.  Might you have a cause of action for wrongful termination later on?  We don't know.  See the first question in this FAQ.

If you are fired, you should file immediately for unemployment.

* **My employer closed the business entirely and ordinarily would have been required to give notice under the WARN Act (or a similar state law).  Was notice required here?**

The federal WARN Act has an exception for ""unforeseeable business circumstances,"" and it's hard to see how this wouldn't qualify.  An important indicator that a business circumstance is not foreseeable is that it is caused by a ""sudden, dramatic, and unexpected action or condition outside the employer’s control.""

You'll have to check your state's specific law, but many either have similar exceptions or others that would apply here, such as ""calamity"" (California).

* **My workplace is shut down due to COVID-19, and/or I was fired or laid off due to COVID-19.  What do I do?**

File for unemployment benefits *immediately* if you are eligible or believe you might be.  See our [CARES Act page](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) for more information.

If you will have trouble paying rent, speak to your landlord; some eviction protections are in place through the [CARES Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) and others through state or local action.

If you will have trouble with mortgage or other payments, check your lenders' web site for further information.  

* **I'm sick, under doctor-ordered quarantine, I have to care for someone who is sick, or care for a child who's out of school.  I don't have any paid sick leave or FMLA protection. What should I do?**

[If you are sick, stay home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html). 

See our summary of the [Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fl05bt/quick_bullet_points_on_families_first_coronavirus/?) and its sick leave provisions and the [CARES Act](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fpikbx/quick_information_on_the_coronavirus_aid_relief/?) and its unemployment provisions.

* **Am I eligible for worker's comp if I was exposed at work?**

Maybe, but unless you are a first responder or health care worker, it could be quite difficult to prove your exposure was at work.  You can always file a claim if you believe you were exposed at work.

* **My company isn't shutting down.  If I get sick at work or on public transportation, can I sue the company for damages?**

No.  Ultimately it's up to you to weigh the risks and decide to go to work, or not to go.

You *may* be eligible for worker's compensation if you can establish you were exposed at work.  Unless you are a health care worker or first responder, this may not be easy, especially as the virus continues to spread in the community.  You can always file a claim if you believe you were exposed at work.

* **I was traveling/exposed to someone with the virus etc.  Can my employer force me to stay home for two weeks?  Do they have to pay me?**

Yes, your employer can require you to stay away from work.  

See the links about leave policies under ""I don't have any paid sick leave or FMLA protection,"" as the same policies/benefits may apply.

* **Can my employer forbid me to travel internationally/at all?**

They can't stop you, but in nearly all cases, they can fire you for breaking such a policy.

* **Can assisted living facilities/nursing homes/hospitals restrict or ban visits?**

Yes.  This is to protect the lives of their vulnerable patients.  Use the telephone to speak to your family member.

* **I live in an apartment complex/building.  Can my landlord prohibit all guests during a stay-at-home order?**

Generally speaking, a landlord cannot restrict your right to have guests completely (they can restrict how many guests at one time and how long they can stay, but these restrictions are usually spelled out in the lease).  This is part of the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment (full, uninterrupted possession) of the leased property.

Restricting all guests is probably not legal and if the landlord later tried to evict you for it, would be unlikely to be successful.  Conversely, it's unlikely to be a sufficient violation of the lease that would allow you to terminate your lease early.

And that said, you really shouldn't be having guests -- ""stay at home"" applies to your guests, too.  Obviously, medically necessary visits and deliveries of packages and goods are not ""guests"" and should always be allowed.  If your landlord took active steps to limit these, you should call 311 or the relevant help line in your area and seek advice.  Unless a crime has been committed or someone is in immediate physical danger, do not call 911 as this is not a police emergency.

* **My apartment building/complex sent out a notice requiring tenants to inform them if someone in my unit is diagnosed with COVID-19.  Is this legal?**

We don't have an absolutely clear answer.  But they certainly have a reasonable interest in knowing if someone is sick so they can take steps like cleaning common areas where that person might have been recently -- laundry rooms, elevators, mailrooms, etc.

Given the situation, and if the building/complex doesn't intend on releasing identifying information publicly, this seems to be a reasonable modification to their rules and regulations, which they have the legal right to change with notice. If you refuse to comply and they later find out you were sick, you can expect to be asked to leave at the end of your lease, or within the legal time if you are month to month.

* **Someone in my apartment complex has/might have COVID-19.  Can I get out of my lease?**

No.

* **My landlord wants to show my unit to potential renters/buyers. Can I refuse to let them in?**

Relocation is considered essential, so concerns over contact with strangers is not a valid reason to refuse showings. People still need to move, and still need to find places to move into. That said, not all circumstances are going to be the same. Tenant’s rights to refuse showings are state-specific and fact-specific to where it must be reasonably limited in scope and frequency, and there are statutory requirements for notice in almost all jurisdictions. Bear in mind that the people who are viewing the unit probably don’t want to come be around stranger’s homes any more than you want strangers to be in your home, and few people are seeking housing who don’t absolutely have to be doing so at this time. 

* **I’ve lost my job, or other COVID-related hardship requires me to need to break my lease. Can I do so without having to pay the liquidated damages (break fee) or rent going forward?**

Unfortunately, no. While evictions are halted, and at a later point there will be better-defined conditions by which tenants will be able to enter repayment plans, there is no statutory option that gives tenants the right to break their lease through hardship in a state of emergency or other executive action such as this. Tenants who have lost their jobs or otherwise are in situations that they will be unable to remain in their home because of the pandemic will need to either pay their break fee or negotiate with their landlord to reach an agreement that lets them out of their future obligation.

* **My roommate/tenant/subtenant invites people over despite a shelter order. Can I throw the guest out?**

No. Roommates have no superior right over the other to limit one's rights to have guests, even if the guest coming over is breaking the law by ignoring executive order. This is just a matter of not having standing, rather than it not being ethically or morally right.  Landlords also do not have the right to eject guests of their tenants - again, even in this circumstance. 

* **My landlord is not providing maintenance during this period. What can I do?**

Landlords are obligated still to address habitability issues, such as heat/water/power. Landlords are not going to be penalized for not addressing things like a dripping sink or broken bathroom door handle in an immediate fashion. The standard for maintenance is ""reasonable timeframe,"" and the courts will simply extend the period of time in which a reasonable person might expect repairs to be done.

The rub is many housing courts are closed entirely. This means in cases where landlords are not addressing issues of habitability, tenants have nowhere to take them to obtain injunctive relief. (This means to get a court to order the landlord to fix/do something.) Unfortunately, this is a serious problem without a real solution; the only option a tenant has in this situation will be to vacate the unit and pursue the landlord for the expense incurred. You really, really, need to make sure you speak with a housing/tenant attorney before using this option, as it will be completely fact-specific. 

* **I am a landlord with a month-to-month (or other at-will term) tenant. Can I give them notice to vacate?**

Yes, with caveats. First, see above if your property applies in limits on your ability to evict. Please remember that ""eviction"" and ""terminate tenancy"" do NOT mean the same thing; eviction is the court proceeding to reclaim possession from a tenant in breach or overstay. You can still evict for overstaying valid notice to vacate as long as your housing courts are still open and as long as your state or municipality has not placed further limits on this. 

* **I own a small business.  Is there any help for me if its being devastated by COVID-19?**

The [Small Business Administration might be able to provide a loan](https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela) under emergency legislation.  Additionally, the CARES Act, which provides additional assistance for small business owners and non-profits, includes the opportunity to get up to a $10,000 Advance on an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). This Advance may be available even if your EIDL application was declined or is still pending, and may be forgiven if you meet specified criteria.

* **Can my university/college require me to have my camera on during class and/or an online exam?**

Yes, there is no law preventing this, and it's obviously for the reasonable purpose of class participation and/or making sure you aren't cheating during closed-book exams.  If you object, take it up with the chain of command at your institution.

* **Can my university/college force me out of the dorm?  Do they have to refund me housing fees already paid?**

The answer to the first question is yes; legally, they can close dorms.  It's unclear at this point if they have to refund or credit any fees already paid, although we suspect many will on a prorated basis.

* **Does my university/college closing/switching to online classes get me out of my off-campus apartment lease?** 

Probably not, unless there's some special college-town provision in your lease about school closures... which is unlikely.  You can always terminate a lease early, but you're responsible for the landlord's damages.  And the landlord is held to normal provisions of landlord/tenant law, such as attempting to mitigate their damages by re-renting.  But keep in mind that may be particularly difficult given the situation.

* **My university/college is still open and having classes on campus.  Can we make them close?**

No.  You can protest it as a policy decision as you would any other decision, but it's their decision to make.

If you have a disability recognized under the ADA or comparable state law that makes you particularly vulnerable, you should work with your school's disability services to request an accommodation.  The sooner the better.

* **My university/college is closing campus and moving classes online.  Am I entitled to some kind of tuition refund?**

Legally, as long as they are providing instruction and the ability to earn units, probably not, particularly given the situation.  You are free to try to negotiate something with them.

* **My high school/university trip/travel abroad program is canceled/I have to come home.  Am I entitled to a refund?**

It really depends on the school's specific policies, any insurance you may have purchased, and other individual factors.  Mostly it's unclear how schools/universities are going to handle these matters for now.  Ask your institution what their policy is, investigate insurance coverage, but otherwise, sit tight for now and see how things develop.  Time to file a lawsuit (with the possible exception of government claims) runs in years, not days.

* **My kid's public school is open.  Are they required to attend?**

Unless the district has adopted a policy stating they won't treat absences as unexcused, then yes, your kid has to go to school, or they risk unexcused absences.

If your child or an adult in your household has a disability recognized under the ADA or comparable state law that makes that person particularly vulnerable, you should contact your school and/or district to request an accommodation.  The sooner the better.

* **My kid's day care is closing, but they want us to keep paying.  What should I do?**

There's no crystal clear legal answer here.  Check your contract.  They probably want you to keep paying so they don't have to layoff their staff.

* **What if I'm organizing an event, like a wedding or other party or conference, and have to cancel?   Am I entitled to refunds for deposits paid to the venue or vendors?  What if I can't perform a contract I entered into for some other purpose?**

Many if not most commercial contracts -- such as rental of a wedding venue or delivery of a product -- suspend obligations that cannot be met due to an ""act of God."" While courts have yet to rule that COVID-19 is an act of God within the meaning of those contracts, there is at least a reasonably high likelihood that they will do so. This will mean that the non-performing party to the contract is not going to be penalized for their failure to provide their good or service.

Additionally, such clauses [generally release both parties from performance under the terms of the contract](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/force_majeure) in which case you might be entitled to a refund. 

The doctrine of ""impossibility"" *may* also create a legal excuse from performance under *certain conditions*, for example: 1) orders with the force of law prohibiting gatherings and closing venues where such gatherings occur; 2) level 4 travel warnings which result in the cancellation of all commercial flights to a location.

Each contract is different, and it may prove difficult to obtain a refund for a number of reasons. Until courts reopen, however, like all other civil issues you are unlikely to have any way to reach a legal resolution.

If the amount of money at issue is significant, you can have a lawyer review your contracts for you once that's possible.  The best practical advice in the meantime is to try to work something out with the venue/vendors for a postponement.  

If you have insurance for your event, you may have a claim, depending on the coverage provisions.

* **I paid for tickets to a canceled event.  Am I entitled to a refund?**

Unclear at this time; it may depend on the terms and conditions of the tickets or ticketing agent, as well as other things.  Inquire from the vendor, see what they're offering, then sit tight for now and see how things develop.  Time to file a lawsuit runs in years, not days.  Some events may also be judgment-proof and pursuing the matter legally might be pointless.

* **I bought travel insurance for my trip and decided to cancel because of COVID-19 concerns.  Do I have a valid insurance claim?**

It's going to depend on the language of your policy.  If you had  ""cancel for any reason"" (CFAR) coverage, you may be covered.  If you didn't and did not cancel because you (or in some cases a family member) was ill, you probably do not, but check your individual policy and with the carrier.  Some trip insurers, such as [Allianz](https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com/coverage-alerts/2019-novel-coronavirus.htm), are temporarily broadening their coverage.  Be sure to check with your carrier.

* **I have to make travel plans for later this year.  What should I do?**

Particularly if you are traveling internationally, consider travel insurance that includes a ""cancel for any reason"" (CFAR) provision.  Make sure that disease, epidemics, and pandemics are not excluded.  Cancel for any reason coverage generally has to be purchased very quickly after your reservations are made.  Check the deductible and make sure the amount covered is sufficient for your needs.

Travel insurance is always a good consideration for international travel.

"I’m 18 years old and wish to move away from my parents house but they said they would go to court and say I’m mentally unstable. Could the police force me to go to the mental ward? [NJ]The reason I ask this…when I don’t answer my moms texts she comes to my house and pounds on the doors. She threatened to bring me to a mental hospital if I don’t sign papers saying I’ll see a therapist. Why does she pound on the door if I don’t answer her texts? Because she thinks I committed suicide. Why does she believe that? Because I left my grill on in my tent and got carbon monoxide poisoning. Mom thinks it was an attempt, it was really an accident. She says if I don’t sign papers to see a therapist they will go to court to make them my guardians (claiming I’m unstable even though I’m not) I won’t be able to decide not to go to a mental facility. They would call an ambulance and have me sent against my choice. Three big guys tying me to a straight jacket in an ambulance.
I’m wondering if I were to move out of my parents house could they send the police to force me into a mental ward after they sign papers in court claiming I’m unstable and unable to make decisions for myself? I know my parents enough to see that they can’t stand the idea of me exercising independence and making an important decision for myself. I’m not unstable."
"I am a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust, who in 11 years has received no information from the trustee. Is this worth fighting? I am the oldest of three children who are beneficiaries of my parents' irrevocable trust in Missouri. The trustee is a family member who has not been in contact with us for several years. The trustee was named because they were also named guardian of the minor children, but they ultimately didn't fulfill that role. The other beneficiaries now live with me. 

I have an incomplete copy of the trust that I requested from the trustee after it became irrevocable many years ago-- because it was faxed and the pages are numbered, I can tell some have been omitted. I have no information about what is in the trust. 

I have concerns about the trustee's management of the trust, as they have faced litigation for mismanaging a second trust. This trustee is a family member who, in addition to not providing a full copy of the trust, has never provided an accounting or any further communication since I have reached the age of distribution (several years ago).

While I know we have rights as beneficiaries, I'm struggling with the cost vs. benefit of taking action. Because I don't know any information about the trust, I don't know if it is ""worth"" taking legal action over-- it would all be out of pocket for me. I'm not concerned so much for myself as I am for my younger siblings who I am now raising, as any financial support would be helpful to them once their survivor benefits end. 

TL;DR- I am an adult beneficiary of a trust, but have no communication from the trustee and an incomplete copy. What can I do own my own to get more information? How do I determine whether legal action should be taken without knowing details of the trust?"
"Company won't let us take home tools we didn't check in when we started working here. I checked in no tools. What should I do? The company I work for is shutting down it's plant in a little over a month. I am an electrician and I had to provide personal tools. We are now being told anything that wasn't checked in when we came to work they won't let us take home. 

This isn't good for me because my entire tool set was never checked in. No one said their was an option to do this. They also bought me replacement tools over the years."
"Can I sue my HOA? I live just outside Portland, OR in the US. I bought my condo a few years ago and I live on the ground floor with a neighbor above me. The HOA has very strict bylaws and love to issue fines for violations. One of the rules in the bylaws was that upstairs units aren’t allowed to have any type of flooring other than carpet. My upstairs neighbor installed it anyway and I. hear. everything! They can’t sneeze or have sex without me knowing about it. I complained to the HOA and instead of fixing the issue they approved a one off situation where they had to “sound proof” the floors with an extra layer under the hardwood to cushion sound. It has only made things worse. I feel like I am living under the cast of Stomp 24/7. They walk/run around their place constantly and sometimes they are so loud it shakes my walls. I am no longer comfortable in my own home and I have no idea how I will be able to sell my place with those two upstairs. Is there anything legally I can do about this situation? I am planning on selling soon and I am freaking out!"
"Ex-girlfriend suing over dog bite from 1.5 years ago. Insurance paid for everything at the time. I moved away since then on military orders. How should I proceed? My dog was taking a nap and was provoked by my ex-girlfriend (who was intoxicated). The dog snapped and bit her as a reaction. Insurance paid for all of her medical bills and the dog was put down. Since then, I received military orders and moved to another state. I received a summons in the mail stating that I was being sued by my ex for negligence, damages, loss of employment, potential loss of employment, etc. I am supposed to report to the courthouse in a different state by the end of next month along with a court hearing in the fall.

"Quebec, Canada // Legal papers being taken hostages by step family to prevent my girlfriend from moving from the city we are living. We are in Quebec, Canada.

My girlfriend (25F) have helicopter parents and are NOT taking well the fact she want her independance. She moved in with me after she started having panic attacks just seeing the house of her family. (I live in the same city as them)

We asked some of her stuff back and little by little, we got most of her stuff back... but they refuse to give her her legal papers.

This include 2 passports, her diplomas, her birth certificate, her previous taxes reports, her citerzenship certificate and a lot more.

We are thinking of filling papers with the police for seizing those documents at their house. We aren't sure how its going to go, my girlfriend think they might disown her out of spite or that they will make her documents disappears if they are warned beforehand.

I would like to know how this goes down, depending if we are asked if we press charges or not. Should we even consider doing so? Can pressing charges be done later if her family try something nasty in payback? Her father is a doctor, it would be bad for him if she pressed charges hence why we are hesitating. He is also wealthy, petty, stubborn and cold-hearted. Her mom is both overly affectionnate and toxic."
"Neighbors encroached 1.5ft with new femce and busted our sprinkler line. Central NJ

Our backyard is small only 20 ft wide. Our neighbor came over 1.5 months ago to ask permision to replace the back fence on HIS property that backs up to ours. We have no pool and no legal requirement for a fence. He does. After the install i come to realize its 1.5 ft on our property. Yesterday we turned the irigation system on and all of our sprinklers are in his backyard and a pipe was burst when they dug the holes for the lists. I chatted with him and he brought up he cpuld just moving my sprinkler line.... No. Hes claiming he told the fencing company to plop the new fence where the old one it. I called the fencing cimpnay and he said we appoved the work (we didnt) and that he was following the neighbors difection and they HAD to push it into our yard bc some bushes got to big... Not my problem. Hes a new neighbor and i dont want bad blood but 5% of my backyard is inaccesible. My sprinkler system is broken and the fence is just downright ugly and crocked. Everywhere online seema to talk about mediating and setting. No. My land. My sprinkler. How should i go about this and do you think theres a chance I can legaly get that fence removed replaced and our sprinkler ficed. They dont seem to be very cooperative. I refuse to give up 120 sqft of land in my already tiny backyard. Thoughts? Thanks all in advanced for reading!."
"My parents (73M/69F) have moved couple onto their property (65M/43F) who convinced my parents to dump their savings into the new property and tried to get them to sign a life estate - please help! We are in Riverside County, California. I posted in the relationships thread and a lot of people recommended I post it here. There is a better description and TONs of comments if you'd like more background info: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gfxtsn/mom\_69f\_moved\_a\_random\_couple\_onto\_her\_property/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gfxtsn/mom_69f_moved_a_random_couple_onto_her_property/)

My parents met this ex-Hollywood couple 4 years ago, two years ago we went through a family tragedy and suddenly my parents bought an adjacent 40 acres property next to their home and started dumping their savings into it to build a yoga retreat for this couple they met. They also moved the couple into a rental on the property at an extremely low rate to help them out. My mom and the man became really close and she started telling me things like ""he doesn't want any business or rental contracts in place, because our relationship is built on trust"", ""he thinks we should go high-end with our property remodel because this retreat is going to attract the 1%s"" (their property is in a very low income desert area and this is not even close to reality), ""he wants me to sign a life estate for him so he knows he won't have to move once we pass away"". That was the one that really got me - this couple tried to manipulate my mom into signing a life estate after dumping over $150k into this new property.

I know they are con-artists, I know they are manipulating my mom, but I cannot seem to get through to her and my step dad. I worked with a PI and saw the man has used 10+ different versions of his name over the years and 5 different social security numbers. He has addresses and PO boxes in his name from all over the country. I've told my parents and they go through phases where they are concerned and seem to realize what is going on, but then go back to trusting this couple even over their own children. What can I do? I'm exhausted and don't want to see my family get hurt, but I feel helpless."
"Is it legal for a pharmacy tech to take your phone number from the pharmacy computer system to text you for personal reasons? I live in Washington DC and today I picked up a prescription from a pharmacy and about an hour or two later I got three phone calls and an unintelligible voicemail from an unknown number and then I got a text that read: 


hey [OP] this [name] the technician from [pharmacy] I'm so sorry how I got your number I thought you were so nice I just wanted to ask can we be friends 

I did not give him my name or phone number, so it’s obvious to me that he got my number from the pharmacy computer system. I’m super creeped out because i’m a single female and I live down the street and now this guy knows my name, my phone number, my address, etc. Is this a HIPAA violation? Is it legal to call someone for personal reasons if you got their phone number from their pharmacy records? What course of action should I take?"

"HOA Won’t allow open garage door, but I have no other choice... please help. Hi guys!  Thanks for taking a moment to read.  My condo HOA in Las Vegas does not allow residents to leave an open garage door while not ‘in use.’  The problem is, my wife and I need to train in there every day.  We are Cirque du Soleil acrobats and have both been indefinitely let go until corona is over.  As is such, our gyms at work are gone, public gyms are gone, and we have gone to incredible lengths to procure equipment we can use at home while we wait this out.  Also, in Vegas right now, it’s over 100 degrees every afternoon and if we close the door we would die of heat stroke, as well as not be able to see anything, and we absolutely cannot let off training over this, because it’s our only way to maintain during lockdown.  Do we have any recourse?  Any advice?  

Thank you reddit.

Edit:  the HOA is requiring I comply or fine me 200$ every time it’s left open."
"Abusive soon-to-be ex-husband leaves handprints on our 1 y/o daughter and the court isn't even looking at pictures for evidence, they're just doing what is easy Hello!
Obligatory on mobile. First time poster. In US/Utah.

Anyway. I'm in the middle of a nasty divorce with an abusive man. I have a protective order against him and he's violated it 3 times. He's having a hearing in a month for that (it's a 3rd degree felony since it's his third violation).  Anyway, he's a violent mfer who will keep pushing the boundaries as long as he thinks he can get away with it. When he and I separated, I predicted everything he would do and I begged the court to listen. He has done everything I said he will do. I know this man very well.

We have almost 50/50 split custody of our daughter (she spends more nights at my house so it's closer to 60/40). She comes home with bleeding diaper rashes, open sores on her neck and in sensitive areas, bruising on her thighs, bruises around her rib cage that are very clear hand prints, she's hungry, her diaper is full to the max, rashes all over her body, and he won't treat her very easily treated eczema. She's usually filthy, and this goes back to before she could even walk. When we were married he would shake her, get angry so fast when she would cry and refuse to feed her until she ""changed her attitude.""

Whenever I file a police report or an abuse report, he will file one right after me to make it seem like we're just going back and forth. The police Dept knows me by name at this point and nobody is taking me seriously. Not even the child protective services.

I have filed 2 child protective orders. One last year when she came back with bruising along her tummy. I picked the WRONG attorney for that and he bullied me into dropping the  CPO and agreeing to the parent time arrangement we have now. I filed the second one recently because of the bruises around her rib cage. I took pictures, I reported it to our child protective services (they haven't reached back out either), I asked specifically for a Guardian ad litem to be appointed. We had our hearing recently and NOBODY looked at the pictures I submitted as evidence and they said there was no evidence of child abuse. But you can CLEARLY SEE HAND PRINTS on my baby. My attorney couldn't be there so I asked for and was granted a continuance.

After talking to my lawyer (and 4 others prior to this one because of all the bs my ex is putting me through), he said that this specific commissioner only does what is easy, not exactly what is right. One of the lawyers I worked with before said that they went in for a hearing and the commissioner hadn't even looked at the case prior to walking in the court room. They all pretty much had the same opinion that she's not doing her job and the court cases to prove it but they're scared to do anything about it because of retaliation.

This has been going on for months and the bruises and other marks my husband leaves on our baby are just getting worse. His hearing for the most recent violation will result in jail time and he's terrified of going to jail. I haven't even touched on his mental issues, but he is fucked up in the head. He doesn't even see the same reality that we do, he overdoses on his panic attack meds and sleeps for days, he can't hold a job, he can't find stable living conditions for the life of him,  he's attempted suicide twice while we were married, he was institutionalized the year we met (before we met) for attempting suicide.

Anyway, I'm legitimately terrified that he's going to kill my daughter and himself before his hearing. And the court is doing nothing about the obvious bruises on her body because of how ""back and forth"" it seems with everything my husband is shooting back at me. From an outside perspective, yes, it looks like we're just trying to get back at each other. But if the court would just LOOK at the bruises he leaves on her body and LOOK at the utter bullshit he puts in his police reports and the actual evidence I have to refute it, they would see that he's a fucking psycho who is hurting a toddler.

His lawyer is making me out to be this spurned ex wife who is just filing protective orders to fuck with him. He LIED saying that I had file multiple protective orders for myself in order to get one granted (I filed ONE and I got it) and that I've just been continually filing CPO after CPO and I've only filed two. The first one was dropped because my lawyer at the time was a fucking manipulative dick.

This same commissioner is handling my divorce too.... I don't want that to happen because nothing will be done. There is not ""best interest of the child"" it's ""fastest way to get this off my plate.""

I want to keep my daughter safe. What can I do? I know I can't run away with her. Our next hearing will be via telephone so there's no way to shove the paper of evidence in front of the commissioner/GAL's face and MAKE them look at what he's doing to her. My attorney is floored by what happened because of the overwhelming evidence I have and he intends to make sure everyone looks at the pictures and evidence. I'm just at a loss for how I can protect my child because they've already made up their minds about this whole thing. They continued it as a formality so that I could have representation when they dismiss the damn thing.

Is there an agency that can help? A group? Something? My daughter will die if my husband has unrestricted access to her.

EDIT: I have taken her to the hospital to have them document it. The only one I didn't take her in for was the most recent bruising because they aren't taking me seriously and I was scared to talk to anyone except my lawyer. That was stupid of me, yes, but the rest of the evidence speaks for itself too. All my doctor is willing to do is write a note saying ""change her more often, bathe her, don't squeeze her,"" but he won't actually DO anything. I've tried submitting that note as evidence, but evidence only works if they look at it.

EDIT 2: I did take her to the Children's Justice Center and showed them my pictures of the most recent bruises. They told me to file a police report and I did. The nurse there was very concerned over it and reported it to her hospital's group but I guess she didn't do anything else since she knew I would report it? I don't know. I promise you guys, I have kept a meticulous record of everything. I have huge binders, stacks of them, full of pictures of the abuse, before and after pictures when she leaves my house, texts from him saying he didn't feed her, just MOUNTIANS of evidence. I don't know where to go at this point."

"Sold alcohol to a minor Location BC, Canada
I just did the most boneheaded thing and sold alcohol to a minor. I got burned to a crisp yesterday and got pretty bad heat stroke so I've been feeling pretty off. I checked both pieces of ID and I got the year wrong, she wouldn't be of age until a couple of months. My brain felt fried from the sun and there was a growing lineup behind her so I rang it through. As soon as she walked out it hit me that I messed up. She seemed pretty nervous so I have to assume she was a secret shopper. Am I pretty screwed here? I'm so anxious and feel incredibly dumb. What would be my best course of action? I have a clean criminal record and it was an honest, albeit very stupid, mistake I made due to having heat stroke."
"Family Property Question: Can we save Grandpa’s Cabin? My husband’s family has a cabin in California that’s been around for 4 generations and is about to be lost to failure to pay property taxes. Just so happens my family gifted us $100k towards buying our first home &amp; raising a family of our own. Is there any way we could use this to save the house? 
Some background, once Grandpa passed the deed was inherited by 7 brothers &amp; sisters. They worked it out at first but eventually some of the siblings stopped paying property tax. It’s been a few years and a large debt to the state has accumulated. They tried to sell it but there are two main issues, the building isn’t to code &amp; one sibling (my father in law) owes a huge debt to the state. He moved to MT &amp; if they sell the house the debt has to be paid off. 
Is this a lost cause or could we save the house?"
"Lived at an address for a month and landlord put bills in my name for a year. I got notified 6 years later, do I have to pay for it? For context, I am a foreign student in the UK. I received my unconditional letter in June, and applied for student halls once registration opened about week later.
Now, I wanted to get a job to pay for my accommodation, food, etc (being from outside the UK I wasn't eligible for maintenance grants), so I decided to move to the UK a month prior to University starting (on 20th Sep 2014) so I could get a job before all the students got there and applied for them. So I booked a flight for the 13th of August 2014.
My student halls wouldn't accept students moving in prior to the 20th of September, so I needed a place to stay for the period between arriving at England and moving into the halls. 
By late July, however, I still hadn't had a definitive answer as to whether my application for the Halls had been successful, so as a precautionary measure, I contacted several landlords, mentioning I'd need a place for this short period prior to 20th Sep. but could possibly need it for the entire year should my application fall through.
I exchanged a couple of emails with a landlord who was happy to oblige. So I arrive on 13th, they ask me for the rent for the entire month plus bills. Cash. There and then. I told them I could only take so much from an ATM daily so I could give them 2/3 now and the rest at a later date. They said OK, I handed the money, they then made me sign the tenancy agreement (more on that in a bit) and I asked to write me an invoice (my dad had drilled it into my 18yo skull, and I can't thank him enough for it). They were quite reluctant as hadn't brought anything to do it but eventually produced an invoice pad from their car, hand wrote one for the amount, gave it to me and left. 
2 days later, I received confirmation of my place at Uni Halls from 20th Sep on, at which time I contact the landlord via phone, let them know and we agree the next time they come down I'll pay the remaining rent for the month + bills for the month. The 2nd (last) invoice I got read 'Balance of rent + part (or ract? It was mostly unintelligible) payment bills'. On the 20th of Sep I move into halls and post my key through the letterbox as they couldn't come and collect it so told me to do this. 

Congratulations for making it through that huge wall of exposition, but we're here now. 6 years later, in the midst of a pandemic and I receive 2 letters from a debt collection agency claiming I owe them gas + electricity for the period of 13/08/2014 - 05/07/2015.
Now, obviously I haven't lived there for this period of time, and I obtained confirmation from my University in writing to state I was contracted with them during these dates, but this raises a couple of questions.

1) It's possible I signed the tenancy agreement for the whole year, since as I mentioned, I hadn't had confirmation. Perhaps I shouldn't, but hey, hindsight. If that is true, am I liable for this bill even though I contacted my landlord and we agreed on a final figure, but didn't sign any further documentation on? (like a termination of the agreement)

2) If we're being pragmatic, there's slim chance a student is renting a property WHILST being simmultaneously contracted with student halls, but I'm not sure if proof that I wasn't living at that address at the time is sufficient to sustain my claim that I should not be liable for these bills.


I'm sure there's things I've forgotten to mention which may be of use to know, like for example I do not have access to the tenancy agreement now, but I still have in my possession the invoices.

Anything else that comes up I'll make sure to update this accordingly.

Thank you very much for even reading this, any help would be welcome. God bless you"
"[FL] Lost my health ins. 18mos ago, but therapist offered to continue seeing me on sliding scale. Now, after counselor and I both left the practice, the office is trying to get me to retroactively pay the full rate for 40+ sessions; says therapist wasn’t authorized to offer a lower rate I lost my job and health insurance in January 2019, and was in mental health counseling at the time. I immediately told both my therapist and the administrator that I had lost my insurance and that I wouldn’t be able to continue therapy. My counselor and therapist offered to see me at a reduced cash rate because “it was unethical to abandon a client at a time of crisis.“

I continued therapy for a year, paying the new cash rate each time. After one year though, both the therapist and the administrator left the practice so I was unable to continue there. Now, six months after my final session, the office is calling me demanding payment in full for the remaining balance of the sessions. Apparently, they were attempting to bill my insurance for the sessions over the last 18 months even though I told them I had no insurance, and the insurance company and/or the office is demanding that I pay in full.

The new administrator, who I’ve never met before, says that the therapist and administrator before were not authorized to offer me a sliding scale rate and that I now owe them for services rendered since the insurance company has refused to pay. My understanding was that I was paying a cash rate, unrelated to insurance.

It’s odd to me that it took them 18 months to notice that my insurance hadn’t been paying them, since they had been being paid every week for several years before I lost my job. I’ve paid exactly what the therapist and administrator said I owed for a cash rate; now they want me to almost triple it retroactively.

Am I up a creek here or should I fight?

TL;DR: Lost my insurance. Therapist offers to continue therapy at a lower cash-only rate. Office mistakenly continued to bill non-existent insurance and is now demanding I repay for the sessions at a higher rate rather than the one agreed to by therapist, administrator and me, saying that the therapist and administrator lacked authority to offer me a lower rate. Both employees are gone from the practice now."
"Probably got scammed though an online purchase of 1600€ (Germany) Hello I am kinda shocked right now and would apprecciate any advice you can give me. Here's the situation: Over ebay Kleinanzeigen (which is like Craigslist in Germany) I made a post about a specific Graphicscard I was looking for, and someone messaged me over Whatsapp because I attached my phone number and the end of the post. He said he had the Card i was looking for and showed me pictures of it which were way too good to be done by an amateur. So I googled a bit and found them on a Tech Forum Post. I asked him if he made the pictures himself he responded he didn't make them  and sent me a picture of  the Graphicscard which was nowhere to be found online. He lowballed the offer I made him for the card which was 1700€ and said he would give it to me for 1600€. I got kinda suspicious but still rolled with it. Now if you pay over Paypal as Seller and Buyer you have insurance incase you get scammed. He did not have Paypal. So since i really wanted the Graphicscard I used a Purchase Contract which I found online. (Linked below) He sent me a picture of himself with his Personal ID (i don't know if that is him but we had a voice call where the voice could definetly match) and some pictures of the ID itself so I could copy the information on the contract. I filled out everything, signed it, scanned it and sent it to him. He printed it out, signed it, scanned it and sent it back. So now I was assured i would be safe and sent the money to the bankaccount he gave me, which was also from the city his ID stated he was located in. So everything matched. He also took me through the whole process by sending me pictures of him printing the contract etc. . So a bit of times passes and i ask him if everything went well and if the money reached his bankaccount yet. He said he doesn't have online banking so he went to a bank by foot and said he would take the money from the bankaccount if its there and then send the Package with the card right after. So then I didn't hear anything back from him and I asked if everything went well. No response. So I went to bed(really worried) and in the morning he had blocked me on Whatsapp. I tried calling his number on 2 SIMS but it doesnt even ring. I also contacted my Bank but they said its too late to cancel it. Im not entirely sure but it seems like a scam to me. He sent me screenshots of his email account, too it looked really legit. There were emails from Forums and Stuff like that.

Link to the contract: [https://www.giga.de/downloads/kaufvertrag/](https://www.giga.de/downloads/kaufvertrag/)

Any help or advice would be much appreciated. I worked hard for that money. Thank you."
"Robinhood does not release funds from my deceased sisters account 
My sister passed away in a tragic accident on the first of February this year. I contacted Robinhood through my personal account about a week after to report the death; the representative was sympathetic and helpful at first and provided me with all the information they need in order to close everything out and have the funds transferred to her family. Through my own research, I found that we don’t have to go through probate court since the estate did not exceed $166,250 (we live in California), so after 40 days I gathered a notarized small estate affidavit, and Robinhood’s required affidavit of domicile from her husband, and submitted it through a secure portal they sent me online along with a color scan of her death certificate. 
I received a confirmation that they received it and that it appeared complete. But then nothing...
I followed up weekly at first, and they let me know that they are “waiting on their legal department to review.” Then the communication stopped. It’s been 3 weeks of no communication despite my consistent follow-up emails. They have no number so I can’t speak to anyone. 
My sister had 2 other accounts in other financial institutions (Chase and a local credit union) both were able to close out and distribute the funds on the same day the paperwork was turned in. 
Her Robinhood account had a little over $55,000 so it’s very upsetting that it has taken this long and I can’t even get an update. All her positions were closed out so that money is all in cash, it should not be taking this long. 

How long can they legally hold on to her money? Is there any legal measures I can take? Can I collect interest?"
"Job offered me a raise, I signed and sent back, they called back next morning with an OOPS Basically my job offered me a new position with a 13k raise. I accepted immediately, and signed the offer with the exact amount and sent it back. The next morning they called and said oops, HR filled out the wrong amount and it’s only 10k, I hope you’re not disappointed. I said it was alright and I understood mistakes happen. Now that I’m thinking about it though, I already signed the new offer and this feels a bit like bait and switch. I don’t want to cause too much trouble because I understand 10k is still a lot of money, but I’m wondering if this is even legal for them to do if the document was signed? Thanks in advance for any input."
"NJ Notice To Vacate Home 30 Days Hi from New Jersey. Yesterday, I received from my mother a handwritten letter to vacate her home in 30 days, June 8th. There is no renters agreement. I don't pay rent at this time due lack of work I can find, in addition to my hours being cut due to COVID-19. However, I clean the house weekly &amp; daily, buy soap and paper products, &amp; food at times. I'm a single mom that can not afford to leave the residence in 30 days. My mother has caused a lot of unnecessary legal drama for me and my daughter over the past two years. We are planning to leave by the summer 2020. Do I have any rights here?"
"My girlfriend, her friend and I were suppose to all move in together. They've signed a 1 year lease and paid first month rent and security deposit already. I haven't done either yet. I've told them both I had changed my mind and they signed and paid anyway. My name is on lease. Will they lose that money if I don't sign? I really don't wanna get this place anymore. I live in WI."
Can I repossess my own car? A friend of mine is separated from his wife but has not had the opportunity to file for divorce. He is currently stationed in the military and she is living with her mom in the states in Florida if that matters for legality. She currently has his car that she is using. It is in his name but she has the keys. She recently hit an animal in the road and caused damage to the car. Apparently this is the second time she has damaged the car. He is making the payments and it’s entirely in his name. I’m wondering if he has any options? His last resort is to stop making the payments and allow the bank to repossess it but that would hurt his credit so that’s not ideal. I’m just wondering if you guys have any advice for him? He hasn’t filed for divorce yet because he can’t afford a lawyer. She’s getting $1200/mo from him and he’s paying their child’s health insurance and he’s paid daycare for most of his life though I think as of recent she has taken that over. I’m sorry if any of that is irrelevant but I’m not sure what to tell him and I don’t want him to get screwed any further. She doesn’t let him FaceTime the kid more than once every couple weeks and he’s really struggling. Now his insurance is likely to go up with this new damage and obviously the trust is gone.

Only my baby (8months old) is his daughter and he told me he won’t sign for me to bring her to Brazil with me. But I don’t work nor can support my 2 daughters here. I want to go back to my country where I’m graduated and can provide for them, and where I have my parents that can look after them while I work. I’m afraid he will take my baby away since he and the baby are belgians and I’m an immigrant!"
"(TX) Our roof was part of an insurance scam before we bought the home. Hi all.

I bought a house in Texas in 2018. We got home owner's insurance before purchasing and our roof is covered under our policy based on their inspection, which did not identify a shingle overlay.

We have had some issues with the roof leaking in the past couple months but we shrugged that off thinking it wasn't anything major. We had the leak repaired and didn't think too much of it at the time.

However, due to my job, I had inside information on a company that redid my roof in 2016. I know the job description (take off old shingles, put on new shingles, and some interior paint work), invoice number, address (matched mine, hey!), cost, previous home owner's name (already knew that but it matched) on the invoice, roofing company's name, etc. It is part of my job to review contracts, so I know for a fact a roofing job of taking off old shingles and putting on new shingles took place in 2016 in the home I live in today. This information is considered confidential and admitting it would affect employment.

When I purchased the home, the inspector stated no issues with the roof (minor wear and tear), but mostly that the gutters needed work. At the time, the paperwork stated the roof was 5 years old. This is not considered old for a roof (had no knowledge of said invoice at the time).

Recently, we were able to hire a contractor for the gutters. The contractor admitted the gutters were bad, then stated our roof had a non-working ventilator (specifically listed in the invoice I saw to create/fix), and had new shingles placed on top of old shingles, thus voiding the warranty of the new shingles and making the roof ""out of code"". Since I (confidentially) saw a contract for the roofing job and the price, I thought this person was trying to pull something on us. He was pushy about having our insurance cover replacing roof and gutters (there was mild hail damage) and we pay the deductible. We explained our roof was only \~5 years old, to which he was confident it was older. Knowing our roof was not the plan, with a contractor this pushy, we sought other contractors.

After a few other calls, it felt like every contractor asked about our roof with no regard to our actual needs. I found a friendly contractor and asked: if these claims were made against your roof, and your mortgage contract said otherwise, what would you do? The sale of the new roof was under the previous owner's name, so I'm not sure I'd be able to contact the roofer. His advice was to contact the real estate agent. Okay.

The second person who inspected our roof for gutter repair mentioned, unprompted, the same concerns about our roof: it's out of code, there were shingles on shingles, this voids the warranty, etc.

I called my realtor, explained the situation, and told her that I confidentially knew that there was a sale on the roof of my house with very specific instructions that have been contradicted by two independent contractors quickly on inspecting my house. I explained I couldn't disclose that info, but that if I could find the name of the roofing agency by honest means, we could pursue accordingly.

The price charged (over double a typical roof of my slant/size) made me think the old owner was being scammed, and I was paying the price.

When my realtor reviewed the files, it said our roof was 5 years old. The old owners lived there 3 years and (when recently asked) claimed there was no work done on the roof during their ownership, yet when they purchased the house, the documentation from prior owners stated it was 7 years old. Meaning when they sold the house, 7 + 3 =10. Why didn't they claim a 10 year old roof? Why did they say it was 5 years old?

I asked my realtor if maybe I had bad info, that the owner had rental properties, and the invoice I saw was for a rental property but billed to that address. She checked, he didn't. My realtor suggested that it was possibly insurance fraud, since the cost was so high, the work contradicted the invoice, and the roof magically got younger during their time living at that address.

I looked at the company's Google reviews, and saw a review from the same name as the previous owner of my house, at the company I know did the roofs, about the time and date that my roof was redone (The review is currently listed as 3 years old) talking about how great the roofers were, and how they double checked everything \*before the insurance agent arrived\*. 

This owner is claiming no roof repairs were done to this house during his ownership which would be from 2015 to 2018, however his review indicates he hired a roofing company in 2016-2017 to do some work on the roof due to insurance issues, was 5 stars satisfied with the result.

How do we proceed? Based on the fact that the previous owner left a review of a roofing company mentioning work was done on his roof, but has told us that no work was performed on the roof while he owned the property, I feel that we have been misled about the state of the property when we purchased it. Should we contact a lawyer to proceed, contact our insurance company, or contact the roofing company? Based on the owners reply so far I don't feel he will be giving honest information so I need some help moving forward so that I can resolve this issue."
"My grandfather died and left a broken down truck on the property we inherited. There is no hope of starting it, how to navigate this with the bank Hi,

As the title states my grandfather died in 2017. While he was living he had a bank loan for a ford truck that had stopped working back in like 2010. This truck was parked on the land since 2010 and is unmovable  (sunk in the mud). My dad had asked what could be done with this and the bank would want it back. I am not sure how to navigate this as why would they want a broken old truck. Would we face any ramifications if we tried to junk it or have a welder take it out piece by piece? It is an eyesore but don't want to get in trouble with laws. This is my first death in the family with inheritance (land) so any help would be appreciated

We are in Wisconsin."
"A city-owned tree on the property i live on just fell and hit 2 cars parked under it. I rent, but I wanted to know who would be liable for the damages? [California] just some backstory: all along this street, and pretty much the entire neighborhood, are these big trees with long branches. branches occasionally fall off due to the wind, but its never been this bad. 

this morning i heard a giant crash, looked outside and the entire half of the tree looked like it bent and ripped off due to weight and just laid out 2 cars parked under it. it looks like it came from a tree where we live. 

i rent, so im guessing it would be the landlords insurance that pays them, but i just want to be prepared in case anyone shows up asking questions."
"(Alberta, Canada) would it be legal for me to take in my sister when she turns 16? So, I am currently 16, almost 17. In 6 years, my sister will be 16. My ‘mother’ simply put should not have been able to raise us. She has let my brother attack, abuse, and choke my sister to the point there was marks on her throat, let him push me down stairs and blame me for it, let him attack me and when I defend myself say I’m the problem, her verbally berate my sister and I, put me through multiple mental breakdowns(to the point I’d have them monthly, and she had me convinced I was bi-polar with how bad my moods and depression got) and a lot more. I’m sick and tired of her shit. I’ve wrote more about her in prior posts aswell if you want more context.

A few months before I was 16, I had planned to run away to my dads home, from my research and advice I had got here, once I turned 16 I could chose the home I staid in, so long as I was with an adult/my dad.  I didn’t run away as I knew as soon as I left, my sister would become a main target, and I wouldn’t be able to protect her. I’d give my life to save that damn kid, shes the most important thing in the world to me.  I just want to protect her with all of my heart, I already feel like a failure because I couldn’t protect her enough already.

Now, my rambling aside, here’s the main point. When she turns 16, I’d be 22, and since I’d be a legal adult, would I be able to take her into my custody/let her stay at my home? Would my mother be able to do anything to get us in trouble about it and take her?"
"My Father-in-law Stole Our Stimulus Check, Split It With a Credit Union To Cash The Check And Refuses To Give Us Our Money. My wife and I haven't been on the best terms with her dad after my wife spent a month living with him last year in Utah. That ended with the police being called on him and arresting him with domestic violence. My wife decided not to press charges but the city prosecutor went after him anyways because he was being a ""jackass and needed to learn his lesson."". Things have cooled down a little bit since then or so we thought. 


Fast forward to now and my wife and I are outside the US and won't be back anytime soon due to covid-19. Before leaving we had our mail sent to his house and forgot to forward our mail after what happened last year. We made less than $24,000 last year and should've been sent a stimulus check for $2,400, which would be extremely helpful for us right now. 


We called him to ask if our check was sent to him. He said our check arrived and said that he could go to his good friend, who's a branch manager at his credit union, and he could help us get our money. His dad tried to convince my wife to send him a message via messenger and he said it was all the bank needed. A message authorizing my father-in-law to cash the check so he could wire us the money. My wife sent a brief message but this is without her signature. 5 minutes after her dad said he had the half of the cashed check and he was going to wire the money to us. 10 minutes later he said that he would only send $700 to us and give us the rest when we fly back to the US. Obviously we said no and he should send us all our money. That turned into an argument and ended with him saying that he wouldn't send us our money. We haven't heard from him since.


Later we then found out that he made an arrangement with his friend, even before we asked about the check, that the bank demanded 50% of the check for him to be able to cash it. We don't have any accounts with that credit union anymore so we don't owe them anything.


We not sure what we can do or what we should do since we are outside the US right now and won't be back for a while. We're thinking about emailing the city prosecutor that went after him last year, but we don't really know what to do and any helpful advice we be extremely appreciated. Also, do you guys know what charges and penalties he would be facing?"
"Can I be evicted? I’m (24F) back again because of my crazy sister L (34F). Several years ago my mom (61F) added L to the deed of her home. My moms reasoning was 2/4 kids were minors, L was in her early to mid 20s. And my mom didn’t have a husband to leave her home to. I believe she was ill advised by her lawyer and L didn’t need to be added to the deed. I still live with my mom while trying to get out of student debt and save for a home. I do not pay rent but my mom has never asked me to and I help out with what I can. L lives in her own home. 

Anyway, let’s fast forward to September 2019. L and I got into an argument over her kids (8F and 4F) making the house messy and having no respect for people’s belongings. One of the kids took a bracelet from me that holds the ashes of a loved one. I was made at L for not disciplining her kids or cleaning up after them. L threatened to put a protective order on me and have me thrown out of my moms house. She did not have cause for this as I never threatened her or became violent. L stated she was my “landlord” and I need to respect her. This caused a huge fight between L and my mom. I’m the youngest and so my mom is very protective of me. My mom asked L to remove her name from the Deed. L refused to sign and told my mom she was dead to her. It took several weeks but things calmed down until March 2020. 

In March my moms health drastically declined. She was in the hospital/rehab for over a month. She is home now. Since admission to the hospital, L went insane. She told the hospital she was an only child and became my moms POA while my mom was unable to make decisions for herself. L refused to update me and my 2 other siblings on my moms progress and told nurses they weren’t allowed to speak with us. I called the hospital prior and they were shocked to find my mom had 3 more kids but they couldn’t do anything to help. This caused a huge fight between my 2 other siblings and myself against L. L again threatened to kick me out of my home. 

It is very stressful to think I could be thrown out of the home I’ve lived in my whole life. I understand with COVID-19 evictions cannot happen right now. I’m worried when this is over what will happen. My mom wants me to stay here. I am the primary caregiver to my mom and she needs me. It’s not good for my mental health knowing L could come here anytime she pleases, move in, or kick me out. Is there anything my mom and I can do to protect me? L and my mom are not speaking currently. A few days ago I had to call the police because L was screaming at my mom and refused to leave. L accused me of stealing from her. I do not have what she wants and I told her it’s somewhere in my moms room but I’m really not sure where. Things have been shuffled and moved around. The police told me they cannot make L leave because she is on the deed. 

I could move out but then the issue of who will take care of my mom comes up. I want to do what’s best for my mom because this may be her last few months. But I also know I need to take care of myself. I’m so stressed out I can’t eat or sleep because of L. She has a history of violence and so does her husband (he was in prison for attempted murder). 

My mom should not be in stressful situations. It makes her confused and stress isn’t good for anyone. If there’s anything we can do please just mention it. We have a lawyer redoing my moms Will and POAs this week. 

This is in Maryland."
"[CA] Landlady claims someone is following her and doesn't want to leave my house. Hello, first time posting. I'm not the best of writers but here goes.

For the past year or two my landlady has been coming over and staying in my house for hours. It was probably a mistake to let her enter in the first place but what's done is done and now she only leaves when we force her to. This started when she claimed she had a stalker. She said that he would stomp on her roof and pee around her house. As time went by her claims would get more bizarre. She said this man has a laser that can do all sorts of things to her like making her stomach ache, keeping her up at night, and even make her wet (why she would tell us this last one, I don't know). She goes to great lengths to be away from her home. I know she sleeps in her car, only eats out, and only showers in gyms. (She asked to shower at my house since gyms are closed. I think she might be going to a friend's house now.)

So my question is, is there anyway to legally force her to get a psychiatric evaluation? Are we legally obligated to let her in? If not, what's the worst she can do to our rent? 

Thank you in advance."
"USA - Illinois - Taking contract freelance work while furloughed. Will I lose my unemployment benefits? I was furloughed at the end of March until July due to COVID-19. I've been asking around but I'm not sure what I should do here.

I have an opportunity for some small freelance work. Nothing major or full time. A couple hundred here and there. Some weeks it may add up to full time work.

Here's the elephant in the room: if I take this freelance work, it would go against what I get paid out in unemployment, and on certain weeks it may completely eradicate my weekly benefits. So if I make 600 or so a week, I would be ineligible to receive any amount of UI, including the extra 600. So I'm making less as a result, but I'm being productive and have opportunities to make money.

I am, however, worried that due to something vague in employment law, if I work enough, I will be considered fully ""self-employed"" and thus lose my benefits altogether when I really want to make extra cash and fully intend on going back to my job full-time once the furlough ends.  


Should I seek out contract work at this time, or am I just screwing myself out of money and potentially losing out on thousands of dollars the next two months if I do contract work?"
"[AU] Retailer says that it would take a while to repair my device - when I see it on sale in their shop. A large retailer here has a product care/warranty where if your device is faulty, they will do a repair. If they can't repair, then you are given a replacement or store credit. However if you choose a replacement or store credit, then you lose your warranty.

I was told by their repair center that it would take at least 5 weeks to repair my device due to parts not being available. So, I chose to have a replacement - which I was told there was none and that I would be given store credit instead.

Today I went to look for a new device, and I saw that there was another exact device in stock. This isn't an issue except I noticed a scratch like my old device had. I can prove that it was my device as I have the serial number. This means that if I bought it again, I would lose money, as I'd have to buy warranty again. If I kept my old device, I would've lost no money.

My question is, could I do anything about this? It feels like they knew that 5 weeks was too long of a wait, and decided to make me drop the repair so that I would have to buy a new device and thus re-buy the warranty instead of getting the fixed device without warranty. They basically profited another warranty purchase from me (worth $600).

My device was a laptop."
"landlord never pays for things wrong with his house Baltimore, MD
Hi, sorry if this is kinda vague. 

My family had some bad times a few years ago during which are old home “went under” and we couldn’t pay for it anymore. There was also a brief time in which my parents lived separately. During this time a man from my dad’s church offered him a home to rent since he was moving out anyways. He doesn’t pay for any house maintenance even though the house is literally falling apart with several broken windows, rotting support pillars, and peeling paint. There was a time in which the garage stopped working, and he didn’t want to pay for the repair. My dad has to literally ask him to help pay since my dad is a good renter and never missed payments, and that the renter could at least pay half. 

There wasn’t a contact agreement written or signed between the renter and my dad.

Do I have any leverage on this guy to report him to anything since it’s still *his* property but he refuses to maintain it despite renting it out? Is it even possible he that can be reported without them singing a contract together?

Edit: my dad met the renter through a family friend of ours that is a realtor  

Edit 2: the broken windows are in my mom’s bedroom and those same windows also are above the patio. I’ve been told to not sit in certain areas since it’s at risk of if/when the glass breaks. The support pillars are made of wood and hold up the awning(?? for lack of a better word) above the main door.

Edit 3: my parents were gardening a few days ago and did warn me of some broken glass that I can only assume came from the window since there’s no other glass in the area besides the sliding doors."
"When I go back to work, I will be expected to commit tax fraud. New York State, USA

Hi, I'm a horse and I'm in a bit of a bind at work.

I'm a ""salesman"" at work by title, but really I got delegated to take care of the sales legwork. I fill in orders, make sure they ship, fill out the required tax forms including a shipping label and commercial invoice, and do the same for when someone needs a part to repair our products or for whatever reason. These are often large orders of expensive machines across borders, usually from NY where I am to factories in China, Korea, or Japan, though the issue happens both internationally and when we ship nationally, usually to universities.

Until I left for corona leave, there was a woman who oversaw the whole process. Really I was easing her job, so she just knew how everything was done at my company. She always wanted me to give false values on the commercial invoices and other forms ""for tax reasons"" which I'm pretty sure is a sly way of saying ""so we can commit tax fraud."" These are often $100,000-200,000 products we list as $200, or at the very least $5,000 listed for $5. The second happens every day, the first more like monthly. I did this because it was a part of my job, but I made sure to let them know I'm uncomfortable with this and the only reason I'm doing it is because my overseer was always the one to put her signature on it, leaving me blameless (?). (Note: I think I'm on one or two of the earlier ones, before I realized that something sketchy is happening.) Well of course while I was gone they shat on her and she left. Now I'm going to be expected to do the same, but I don't want to break any laws for a sketchy company I don't even like.

Would I be held legally responsible for what I've done so far? 

Should I be turning these people in?

Who would prosecution go after? I actually like the woman who quit.

I've seen the IRS gives a reward for people who help with significant cases of tax fraud, is this something I can claim a reward on? Would I be incriminated to the point I could not get a reward? Am I looking at jail time?

I am considering sending an email to my idiot CEO when I get back basically saying ""I think what you're asking me to do is illegal, do I have to do it?"" I think he would send an email back saying ""yes or you're fired"" but I don't want to get too deep in this before I know what the legal situation is. I'm in my 20's and am honestly scared I'll be held accountable by the next person in my position."
"Neighbors Making My Life a Living Hell.. How do I deal with this. Short story: I’m living in the US in New York City under public housing. Neighbor from hell making my living atrocious for pass year/two. And I have no ideas on how to through living like this. Please help...

Pre-quarantine: A year ago every single day, the neighbor next door would knock on the door so damn loud that neighbors from the other side of the building would be able to hear it. You would think why I would be complaining about knocking but they actually knock for at least 30 minutes for the other person to open and it’s at 5AM in the morning, EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m not even exaggerating. The neighbor thst was living next to them yelled at the person knocking that he would break his door if he doesn’t stop. You think he would stop but nah. It just kept omg going on. And I’m pretty sure they drove that person away because I see a different person coming in and out of there now. Then for about a good 6-8 months after the other neighbor left, they occasionally blasting music late at night usually 12AM till the brick of dawn. And almost every weekend they allow their kids stay up all night running around stomping. I’ve contacted 311 countless dozen of times and all they said is that they filled out a noise complaint to the police and they will investigate during their off duty hours. (Or something along the lines of that).


Quarantine: They’ve got a pet dog. It’s not bad that they have a dog, I’m not complaining about that they got a dog. But I am complaining about his their dog ACTUALLY BARK FOR LITERAL HOURS AND THEY WON’T EVEN STOP AND CONTROL HIM/HER. Any time of the day, you name it the dog provides it, they won’t care. When the dog stops barking, it’s their cue to start blasting their music. 

I’ve texted one neighbor from the other side of the building if they could provide me some info to tone it down. He replied with 311 or housing management number. Otherwise, wear ear plugs. Apparently they have been letting their dog pee on their side of the building.

"Moved to Nevada from California. Car was paid off but lien never removed and company is gone. To be more specific. I moved from California late last year to Nevada. The car I own was paid off over 15 years ago and was registered with no problems. Upon moving and attempting to register it in Nevada, I was informed that the original loan company never filed correctly to show it was paid off ( I have receipts and such of the payments and agreements from then but doesn't seem to be enough).

The main issue that occurs however is that the business is gone and no longer around. The company that purchased that business does not have any of the records from that time period. The DMV and such has been very unhelpful for figuring out how to then register the car. I wish to sell the car but legally can not as of now as far as I am aware.

I am wondering if there is a legal recourse to obtain the registration or work around the issue and register it so as to sell. "
"Shitty boss. Hasn't paid me my last two paychecks or other people. Department of labor basically useless. Multiple people have tried to get paid (some as far back as October last year) how in the hell do I get paid? Legit question. First, how are they still able to operate when breaking the law so frivolously. I know there can be a jail sentence for not paying your employees but who really enforces that if not the DOL? I tried calling the district attorneys office and the lady is basically clueless and is like we prosecute criminals here (hey, this guy is one but ok). Any solid advice or suggestions would be appreciated (Kansas is the state).

Edit: to clarify I mean my last two paychecks after i stopped working there (two days before the pay day so missing one check and another with a couple of days)

Edit 2: the reason I asked why he's still allowed to operate is because some people still haven't been paid from quiting back in October. And I was told by them that the DOL knows him by name there. So that's why I asked why they're not doing anything. He never shows up to their Court hearings etc."

I came in this morning and asked how I was supposed to use that chemical and he just said to rinse my hands every few minutes. I've been sent home because I refused to use it without gloves. He said if I don't come in tomorrow and do the stuff that uses that chemical I'm fired. 

I don't think he'll be able to find more gloved now and I refuse to use that chemical without gloves. 

What are my options?"
"Buying house, sign additional addendum Well, guess it’s my turn.

So I’m buying a townhome. Closing date all set and signed by both parties on addendum.  Well, cabinet makers were shutdown for a short time and now it’s changing my closing date from (22nd) to later the following month (02nd). 

They are trying to get me to sign the addendum, and relieve themselves of any thing extra costs associated with me being displaced or my belongings.

They have tried telling me that I should get an Airbnb, hotel and other things that would be coming out of my pocket, as well as a storage facility or pod for temporary storage needs.

The townhome is new construction and they are doing things to get it all ready in time and even asked to sign a zero day walk and they would come fix later.

The sales person/realtor just dumped me after papers were signed and haven’t heard from them, but the others are picking up their slack.

I’ve been walking the house and giving them a list of items that need correcting so there isn’t a list for this zero day walk they are proposing.

I will lose my rate lock a few days before the “new” close date and they offered to pay that to extend, but nothing else.

So I was wondering, is my thinking correct that if I sign the new closing date addendum which gives me no moving time to relocate belongings and displaces me and my child for a few days.....I’m S.O.L?  They are fully aware that I’m a single surviving parent and expect me to cover the cost from them being contractually late/delayed on the contract.

What can I do, as time is coming up fast and I need to take appropriate action. 

Thank you!

"Family court CA procedural questions I’ll be as succinct as possible. I was in court 1/29 represented myself agains my ex lawyer.  Won50/50 custody.  The judge ordered to adopt the mediator recommendation.  I asked for specific verbiage to be included which nobody objected to and the judge agreed with.  Her attorney was tasked with drafting and filing this new order for the timeshare with the children.  I went three weeks after to the court to get the record and it was not filed yet. The support portion of order was postponed until April, but then Covid came and so were in limbo to finish this  case but the custody side was ruled on 1/29. Now my ex is not agreeing to the verbiage and I have no documentation because either her attorney hasn’t filed it or I can’t get to the records because of Covid. There was no court reporter on 1/29 but I’m wondering if the minute notes would contain what everybody agreed to on that day? 


Should  I have  been given the opportunity to review what her attorney drafted before it was filed ? Cause it seems like I’m just having to trust her interpretation and integrity to do the right thing... :-/ 

What recourse do I have if her attorney filed it without me getting To review and agree on it of if I disagree?"

"A ex used pictures on his blog and store website without my permission and made some negative comments about me in his post. Do I have any legal recourse? Hi everyone,

This is my first post here so I'm trying to make sure I provide all the necessary details. Basically, when a friend was doing a google search of me, he found a wordpress article about me and used a picture of me and my sibling at a pool in the article. Upon further investigation, we discovered that he was using my pictures on his website to sell clothes without my permission. 

I am trying to file a civil suit in court, and wanted to know the best course of action to seek punitive damages and get him to remove the post and pictures of me from his various sites.

"Apartment building switched my storage unit to a smaller one without telling me I recently purchased a unit in a newly built apartment building. I was the first purchaser at the time and a few months after purchase, management told me that each unit now has storage units in the basement of the building that they had just built and divided. Someone from management showed me the storage units and how each unit was labelled with the apartment numbers (basically a door sign) and showed me my unit and told me I could use this from now on. By chance, the one that had my apartment number on it happened to be one of the larger storage units, which was nice. I didn’t have much to store other than a few empty boxes from moving in. Management told me I could use my own padlock to keep things safe, but I figured I didn’t need a lock at the time because it was just empty boxes (mistake on my part in hindsight).

Fast forward a few months (to a few weeks ago). By this time some of the other units were sold. I go down to store some more valuable items and have a padlock in hand to lock my valuables. What was my storage unit is now locked (not by me). All of the door signs that labelled/assigned the units to each apartment are gone, and my unit now has a piece of scrap paper taped to it with the number of a different apartment. The only remaining open storage units are very small (about half the size of my original unit). I call management and they say they don’t know what happened and why signs were removed from all the units. I call the selling realtor and he goes back and forth with the builder and he gives me different answers until eventually he tells me that the labels were originally mislabeled and the larger units were intended to be assigned to the more expensive apartments. I have my doubts as my purchase contract and the other a paperwork I received didn’t even mention storage units as they were nonexistent at the time of purchase (and I’m assuming the same goes for the contracts of the other units). Also, I wasn’t even notified of this change. So I guess what I’m asking is: if I was originally assigned the larger storage room by management and all the units were labelled originally, do I have any right to get access to my original storage room?"
"How to divorce in Illinois Illinois, worst legal system in US. Have a minor. Divorce reason - husband drug addict (cocaine). Judge ignorant (denies all motions, drug testing - denied, didn't visit child for three months now - parenting time motion denied and so on...), every court meeting judge is late (usually 2hours late, last few courts didn't show up - forgot). Money for attorney is coming to an end - been 2.5 years, nearly $100k spent, and nowhere coming to and end. Other party just denies everything, and it goes back and forth. Can not do anything with life and it's just insane. Granted parenting with child already. I understand, that every story has two sides, but one side provides evidence, pictures, text messages, bank information, and other just does nothing, and judge just keeps extending time. Is it even possible to change judge? Running out of money - changing to public attorney, would it fasten things, even if I lose everything? What happens if I move to other state with minor - would they put me in jail and put kid in foster house? They force me to come back to Illinois? Grant other parent to live with kid? I don't even know what to do, insane thoughts going through my head. Any advice would be great, thank You"
"PPP Loan and Shelter in Place - California Hi! I need help. My boss was funded with her PPP and is putting us back on payroll as of Monday the 11th. We will then go off unemployment - that part is understood.

Where there is some confusion - is that our county still has a shelter in place and we are a non-essential business. She is demanding we come to work (in office) since she is paying us and the PPP money has to be fully paid within the 8 weeks. Can she do that?

Also, with the PPP funding - couldn't she just start the distribution of funds to the employees on June 1st when the SIP should be lifted?

Another part of it - what if some of us can work from home and do 90-100% of our duties?

She is confused on how this works and I am trying to find some answers. Thanks in advance."
"Bought my home in 2016. Got a summons today saying the deed was forged. I bought my home in 2016 from a woman who owned a real estate company. She was selling some properties her and her ex husband owned. Come to find out, the original owner was their step son who was in jail at the time.  I had no knowledge of this. 

From what we knew, he sold the properties to both of them long before we purchased the home. 

Now that he is out of prison, he is suing (I think?) me, his moms company, and 8 other homeowners in the area that bought homes from the mother’s company. He is saying the sales are fraudulent, because his signature was forged. 

I got the summons today. Kinda freaked out. I figured the person on the summons was the lawyer, so I called the lawyer, and it was actually the dude who got out of prison. I basically asked him what was going on and he told me that the properties were stolen to him and that his signature was forged on the deeds. I was like well, I had no knowledge of that. I just bought the house as a first time homeowner and everything seemed legit. 

He was like no, so and so warned you. I said no.... no one ever warned me about this. And had they, I wouldn’t have bought the house.  He got a slightly hostile, but it ended cordially. 

I’m an idiot for calling him, and had I known it was him, I wouldn’t have. I said sorry to bother him and I hung up. He’s representing himself in this case. 

So I called my title company. I faxed the summons to them, and they’re getting with their council and will call me back.  They are aware of a lot of these people, and seemed to know a lot about the people involved with this, as if there is history here. 

Do I need a lawyer? What do I do in this situation? Aren’t I entitled to a defense from the title company?  I don’t want to have to pay any money for something I didn’t even do. I bought the home legally... if someone should be held accountable, it should be the parents (if the signature was even forged)."
"I've been harassed for 2+ years by a person over the internet. Would it be illegal to find public information and mention that information like that exists? Some backstory. I'm currently in quite some dilemma. I've been harassed by the same person for well over 2 years straight. At least once a month he goes out of his way to find a way to harass me. It's gotten to the point where it's hurting my mental well being and I'm looking into ways to get him to stay away from me but so far I've had no success. I've tried the police but they're unable to do anything because it's over the internet. I've gone out of my way to block him on everything just to avoid any interaction that I possible can have with him but he still finds me in a game that we both play and harass me in that if all his options fail.

&amp;#x200B;

For the specific thing I'm asking about. I've managed to find public, no hacking, no phishing, no ipgrab, no nothing. Strictly public information about this person. Would it be illegal to show him some of that information and suggest that he leaves me alone or the cops will start looking into it more?

&amp;#x200B;

We both live in Sweden and we are both over the age of 18 if that makes any difference.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit\* Just in case I did not make it clear enough. I am not looking for a way to threaten him or do anything with the information that I have managed to get. I just want him to leave me alone and not harass me."
"Notice to move out but with some issues Currently live in PA and due to Covid-19/losing employment, I have to move out as I'm just going to flash through my savings. I am behind on my rent by a couple hundred dollars. After emailing and telling them, they were fine but the property manager just got back to me saying I'm not allowed to give notice to terminate early (in which I was ready to pay the penalty) because I was short on rent this past month. I was wondering if this is still upheld during Covid? I know nothing about these laws so I figured it was worth asking. Doesn't make much sense to force people to stay when they can't afford their rent as it is. I don't want to get even more behind.

"CA-Bay Area: Neighbor wants to replace fence without permission My neighbor stated that he wished to replace the fence that is separating our backyard. He said that he will pay all the costs. Two out of the three fences in his backyard need to be replaced as they are torn apart and fallen down.

However, I do not wish to replace this fence as it is perfectly fine and matches all of our other fences. Our shared fence is made out of redwood and his other two are not. I suspect that he will build the replacement fence with inferior materials as he is a general contractor and plans are re-selling this home as soon as he's done fixing it up. He said that this fence needs to be replaced because it is damaged (it is not). I think he just wants all his fences to be matching for when he sells it. Is he allowed to tear down this fence even though I said no? The fence is on the property line."
"[OH / NJ] Warranty company is refusing to honor my warranty for a laptop. I live in Ohio. Laptop company, ""L Co,"" is in California. Warranty company, ""W Co,"" is in New Jersey.  

In August 2019, I purchased a laptop with a 1 year warranty from L Co.  When I received the laptop, I realized that the warranty was actually administered by W Co. In February, the laptop stopped working, so I contacted W Co. They told me, in an email, to return the defective laptop and they would send a replacement with 3 to 5 business days. I mailed them the defective laptop that same week.  

I didn't hear from W Co for several weeks after I returned my laptop, so I contacted them via email. They responded that they ""don't have a replacement available"" and I need to contact L Co to issue a refund. I contacted L Co and they said it was too late to issue a refund and that I needed to talk to W Co for a replacement. For several weeks, I went back and forth between L Co and W Co while they each pointed the finger at the other.  

That basically brings us to now. I have emails from W Co stating that I have a valid warranty and they received my broken laptop in the mail. They state they ""don't have a replacement available"" and won't give me a refund because I purchased the laptop from L Co and not them.  

I'm not sure where to go from here. I filed a complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General, but haven't heard anything. Should I file a police report for theft? Should I file a small claims case? If I do either of these, would I do it in Ohio or New Jersey? Can I dispute my credit card purchase? I hesitate to do that because I purchased from L Co and they delivered the product as promised. Any insight or suggestions are greatly appreciated."

"Apartment complex hasn't asked me to pay rent I moved into a new apartment recently.  A week before I moved in I got an email saying I would pay my first months rent when I arrive, however when I moved in the leasing agent just gave me a key without mentioning paying rent. He gave me a check list of things I had to agree to, one of which said that I paid rent. I did not check this box, assuming that he would then raise the topic and tell me how and when to pay rent each month. He did not do this, however, and proceeded to give me the keys. I am now all moved in and wondering what is going to happen. Can I expect them to just request rent at some point? Am i correct in assuming that they would request rent before moving to evict? Should I raise the issue myself or wait until they get into contact with me? I feel that I am kind of in limbo here and obviously do not want any legal recourse but I feel that this is not an error on my side of the agreement but rather the managements error.

An insight into my situation and potential outcomes would be greatly appreciated."
"I am a student in a graduate program and I don't feel like I'm getting what I paid for. As the title says, I am enrolled in a graduate program for which I've taken out a fair share of loans to pay for. The basis of the program was that it would center around a team based project which would persist for the duration of the program. There are several other teams of students in my program which have been interacting and proceeding well with their project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Enter my team, with a specific individual we'll call Jen. Now I've worked with my fair share of teams and never really had too much of an issue but working with Jen has been an entirely different animal. It's not just that Jen is difficult to deal with (she is) but she doesn't seem to listen to any input that the team offers her and anything we offer to help enhance her work for the team, she takes as criticism and aggressively defense herself. Additionally she hasn't tangibly contributed anything to the project we are working on, yet she receives marks in line with what the rest of the team is receiving as a majority of our grades are done on a team basis. Both myself and other members of our team have spoken to the program administration about our predicament but little has been done to mitigate the situation. One thing I would like to point out is that several times when Jen has been angrily defending herself, she's mentioned that she has a disability. I never really gave that much thought but some recent developments in how administration team has decided to handle some issues we've faced have felt like she is getting some sort of special treatment, to the detriment to the rest of the team.

"Rental Property: Carpet odor question I just recently moved into a rental house in Nevada, and one the bedrooms has an obvious animal odor coming from the carpet. It is absolutely distinguishable from the other rooms. There also is a carpet repair patch next to the door frame, which has also been damaged by what one would guess to be an animal. I have listed this on my move-in inspection sheet, but the property management company claims that the carpet was cleaned previous to my move-in. They also seem to be slowly taking the defensive, by saying they'll try and send someone out, but they're ""not sure what else can be done"".  

I've been trying to look through Nevada legislature, but I can't really find anything specifically on carpet conditions. Under the NRS118A.290 Habitability of dwelling unit; section (h) it states *""Floors, walls, ceilings, stairways and railings maintained in good repair""*, but does include carpet odor? patch damage? 

I just would like to see what I can legitimately do before I make enemies with my property management company not even 2 weeks in. And ultimately if it comes to it, I don't think replacing the carpet in one room is unreasonable."

"Refrain from order details. I had too much to drink on a handful of occasions a few months ago, at my home. GF lives with us, as does GFs sister. GFs sisters kids visit periodically. Nothing happened, but my girlfriends sisters kids (ages 5 and 7) were present and I was being loud and silly and eventually went to bed. My GFs sister does not like me. She thought it was necessary to get a ""refrain from"" order, saying I cannot consume, be under the influence or possess alcohol in the presence of the children. If I break this, I go to jail. Obviously I do not and have not violated the order out of fear. All has been calm. Because I was not present at the court (I was served at my front door by cops/sherriffs), I have a court date which on the paper says ""Purpose: Return of process"" scheduled next week. A few questions I have (I live in NY):

When I go to the court...what exactly do they need from me? What are they going to ask me? Do I need a lawyer? From my understanding, since I have not violated this order, the judge will ask me if I want to dispute the order, since I was not present with her at the court when this document was obtained, I have any questions and that's it. I continue to do what I'm supposed to.

Secondly, like a fool, I spent a weekend at a friend's house about a week ago and shared a joint with him. I've been so consumed with just not drinking alcohol anywhere, it didn't cross my mind. I know, lesson learned. THC is unrelated to this Refrain from order, but will the courts test me for alcohol usage (and any other drug) and obviously see THC? I'm under the impression family court will only test you if you've violated the refrain from or had any problems or incidences.

Also, since the conduct I am supposed to abide by, says no possession, consumption or under the influence of alcohol ""in the presence of"" the children. Am I allowed to drink away from the house with a friend or collegue, say if I had 1 or two beers at a lunch meeting, and come home 6 hours later bone sober? And believe me, I'm so anxious i have no interest in participating in this. Im just curious.

What does the THC that's likely in my urine play into all this?

"(AZ, USA) My abusive ex destroyed my stuff I (19M) was with my abusive ex for about 5 months (24/25M). He was coming out of a bad relationship himself so with barely knowing him, I offered him to stay at my apartment with his cats and dogs (2 dogs and 2 cats). I needed a roommate as mine had just moved out, and I thought it’d be perfect (Im young and stupid I know). I had no idea for the hell I would live in. He was controlling and emotionally manipulative (I couldn’t go to classes because “what about him” and “I didn’t really love him if I went” + any time I would go he’d go into a suicidal rampage). During this time I also had a dog. One day he came home with another dog. Then another. Then another. And cats too. I repeatedly asked him to stop and he never did, and he expected me to solely care for the animals, pay the bills (including 1100/mo rent), all while he never worked and had my bank info so any time I got money he’d immediately use it for himself. Any time I’d confront him he’d go into a suicidal bout and talk about how he should “just kill himself” then. Because of the apartment conditions I eventually developed a kidney infection with an uncommon strain and was completely bathroom/bed ridden. Eventually there were 10 dogs and 10 cats in this apartment (including my now 2 dogs, who I took care of separately and went out of my way to make sure were as healthy as I could provide for and had separate food, toys, and treats). Animal control was called and all animals were seized, I went to court to get my dogs back and spent 2000+ in lawyer fees and general court fees as they said I was an accessory (my parent wound up being able to get my original dog back which sucks I couldn’t get the other one too but hey what’re you going to do). During the court case the cop repeatedly misgendered me (We’re both FtM) and *laughed* when I said I had had a kidney infection and that I’m blind (I was diagnosed at birth with a rare genetic condition, I have the medical documents to back up both these claims) and it was generally awful. The worst though was after the animals were seized I had moved out after my ex had raped me (He got me blackout drunk while he was sober so he could sleep with me thinking it’d get me to stay as he knew after my animals I hated him and didn’t want to be with him and to get away. I already had a friend who was actively trying to help me leave) and my ex squated on the property and wouldn’t let me pick up my stuff. I salvaged what I could from when I had moved out but the rest had to be thrown out, and countless memories with yearbooks and what not were lost because he wouldn’t let me inside. Do I have any legal recourse to get money from him so I can get fees back, money for new stuff or *something*? Sorry this was long.

"What are my options if my ex husband takes my son without permission? I got divorced in 2017 in  Vermont. The custody agreement names me as having primary physical responsibility (aka day to day care of the child), and it states ""(ex husband) shall have contact 3 days per week at a time to be agreed upon by the parties and shall have the minor child over night 1 day per week, being on an overnight between 2 of the days when he shall have parent-child contact.""

Today while I was at work, I got a text from my husband asking why I didn't tell him that my ex husband was going to picking up my son today.  My ex husband had told him that he had texted me about it, but I hadn't gotten a message at that time.  I figured it was just bad service and bad communication (pretty common for my ex husband).

Then I get the text which reads: 
""Change of plans we are planning on going to Walmart and want to bring (kiddo)
Today, and now ish 😆😆😆""

For context, I have had kiddo for about two weeks straight because I was concerned about social distancing.  However, I asked if it was okay and offered to make up for it later by allowing him to have extra time.  We had a set day when he would be getting kiddo again (Sunday evening so that his girlfriend could participate in mother's day, too).

I did not hear back from him for two hours and I still haven't gotten an answer about when he will be bringing kiddo back.

"IL My grandmother may have been lied to about her adoption. Can I find out more information? My grandmother is Native American. She and her twin brother were adopted to a white family a very young age. She doesn't remember life before being adopted and she was always told that her birth parents were negligent. They gave up her and her sibling(s) because they were unwanted. I recently learned about the Indian Adoption Project, and how it was cultural genocide that forced native children to assimilate into white families. As many as one third of American Indian children were separated from their families between 1941 and 1967. She was born and adopted during this era, and it leads me to believe that she was a victim of this. Her adoptive parents are long dead, along with her twin brother.

"Can I sue my former roommate over last month's rent? Here's a quick summary of my situation: about seven months ago, I had an emergency and needed to move out of state to be closer to family. I talked it over with my roommate (Mike) at the time, since we were only halfway through our lease and I didn't want to leave him high and dry. He said he was comfortable with me leaving, and instead of breaking our lease wanted to sublet my room to one of his friends (Sarah).

After explaining the situation to our landlord, the landlord said that we would have to sort the details ourselves as far as replacing initial finances (first/last month's rent and security deposit). I first texted Mike to explain that I would send an email asking Sarah for first month's rent (a prorated amount for the month I was moving out, since I had already paid for that full month), last month's rent, and the security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. He agreed that this would be fair. I then sent an email to Mike, Sarah, and CC-ed myself explaining the same thing. After sending it, I got a text from Mike saying that it wasn't fair for Sarah to pay this much because ""nobody has that kind of money to move"" (red flag #1). We went back and forth and eventually agreed that she would not have to worry about the security deposit, since I ""would probably get it back anyways"".

Fast forward to the week I am about to move out, Mike comes tome and explains that it's unfair for Sarah to pay last month's rent and that she should only pay first month's rent (red flag #2). At this point he already knows that I have quit my job and made plans to live in another state, so it's too late for me to stay at this point. I pushed back and explained that I thought it was fair because I essentially already paid her last month of living, and therefore she should pay me back. After going back in forth, Mike verbally agreed to reimburse me for last month's rent. On my move-out day, I was venmo-ed the prorated first month's rent and was told that Mike would venmo me at some point for last month's rent (red flag #3).

Within a few weeks of moving, I tried reaching out to Mike about last month's rent. He never responded. I decided to wait until our last month of the original lease (this month) and then reach out to Sarah to see if she had planned on paying me. I tried reaching out repeatedly over Venmo and text but was ignored. It had been three weeks of me trying to get in touch with her.

My last month's rent was around $750. As someone in their mid-20's with chronic illness, that's a lot of money to me. I'm incredibly anxious because I'm still not sure if I will get my security deposit back, which would total around $1500 lost from this living situation.

It this worth taking my subletter to small claims court for? Do I have a case? I have text and email receipts of agreements for her to pay my last month's rent, but am not sure if this is enough. This has been an incredibly anxious experience and my anxiety would be eased if (at the very least) I could get my last month's rent back."

They received the PPP loan, but have slashed hours/salaries to 1/4 of what they were. If we go back to work, we will be making less than what base unemployment is in our state (FL). We will be making around $250 a week before taxes. On unemployment, we were making around what our salaries were pre-COVID ($275 before taxes for state unemployment benefits +$600 federal). 

Our employers have around 50 employees, and the higher ups, like the practice manager and partners are making full salary while working reduced hours, while “regular” staff’s pay is slashed. 

They’re also not putting any precautions in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus, used up all of our paid time-off (no sick pay) to pay us out when we were furloughed initially (no permission granted), and did not pay a coworker who had to quarantine prior to them shutting down (they paid out that coworkers PTO, and sent them to unemployment, though the CARES act states those forced to quarantine were due regular salary). Without PTO, and with how they’re slashing our paychecks, if someone gets sick, we won’t be paid for the days off and many of us can’t afford that right now: 

Do we have any recourse? Do we have to return to work, or will we be placed off of unemployment if we reject? Any advice appreciated."
"recycling fees California My state charges a refundable recycling fees for items like soda. In order to get your money back you have to go to a recycling center. The recycling centers have been closing down. There is one open in my area now (temporarily shut down due to virus). If this center does not open and there is nowhere to recycle, is it still legal to charge fees? There was discussion about requiring the supermarkets to accept recycling and redeem fees, but it's been going on for a few years with no action."

"Is it illegal or wrong to offer help for those who are eligible for stim check, but don’t know how to do it or didn’t know they were eligible? This is a genuine question. I have some very absent minded cousins who were not aware they were eligible for this! So I helped them and it got me thinking about all of those other people that don’t know how to do it, or dont understand if they’re eligible or not. I offered my help online, I wasn’t even charging to help these people, and someone came and accused me of being a cheat and told me they were going to report me for this. 

I, very seriously, didn’t do this wanting to harm or cheat anyone. I understand these are trying times for a lot of people and if there really are adults out there that don’t how to do this all I wanted to do was help. 

I’m worried now. I’m not a bad person and if this was wrong or illegal I legitimately didn’t know."

"Unclaimed money from a medical office/lab is in my deceased father's name but I was the patient and paid originally I went looking around on Florida's unclaimed property website and searched by my last name. 1 result and it was a lab. It's small $120, but it's in my dad's name and has an old Florida address where I once resided. My dad has never lived in Florida. I was on his health insurance at the time which is why I'm assuming the claim is in his name. The state wants documentation

-original certified copy of death certificate

-certified copy of legal probate documentation dated within the last year indicating I'm a legal heir or representative of the estate 

-proof that the deceased owner is the same individual who is listed on the account being claimed


I guess my question is, is there a way to get that account put in my name? If not, how would I go about obtaining the legal probate documentation? I currently reside in California, my dad did too before he passed away in 2016. I'm sure without a doubt that the heir is my mother. Are there fees associated with it? 


Honestly the more I type this up the more I keep thinking eff it, it's not worth the trouble. I'm almost thinking I should've claimed it in his name and deposited it in my mom's account since she has one in case straggler checks in my dad's name come in."

"Apartment maintenance stole my roomates wallet So I live in a small military town called El Paso Texas and a few days ago we had a pipe bust and start leaking in my apparment ceiling. We called and had maintenance come to fix it. Now to set the scene; the leak and issue was in a small closet area in a small alclove area off from my hallway next to my roomates room and wasnt a area I could stay in easily with the big equipment they needed in such a small area. That small area has a desk with lots of my roomates things like his PC, router, and a few snacks and such. He ended up moving a lot of his stuff and moved his wallet to the corner so it wouldnt get knocked off as he is super OCD about always having it on the desk. It was a gift from his Dad who died when he was 10 and has everything from his military ID to his social. It also had a lot of papers for his upcoming deployment and lots of other things; credit and debit cards, etc. When maintenance left the wallet was gone. He had it with him earlier and moved it to the corner of the desk and I saw it earlier myself. I went to the office to make a complaint and ask to have it possibly even dropped back anonymously in our mail so I dont have to persue this. Yesterday charges just were made online labeled something from Nintendo they bought multiple times to some of his debit and credit cards. We already put out fraud alerts and such..... But I dont see this getting persued and want to have the person caught. My roomate who is like family is going to be getting into trouble and possibly a artical 15 at his job for losing the paperwork and military ID. Help?"
"[MA] Landlord is requesting a deposit in order for me to renew my lease, but she still has my initial deposit from when I signed the lease. Is this legal? I live in an apartment with three other tenants, two of which are moving out on May 31 when our lease ends. Myself, the other current tenant, and one other have already signed the lease. The person who will be filling the fourth spot in the house cannot sign the lease or pay the deposit until June due to financial instability amid Coronavirus. Our landlord knows this, and is okay with it, as long as we have a sublettor in the fourth room until the new roommate can officially sign. My question is, do myself and the other current tenant need to supply our landlord with an additional deposit for our new lease? She has not returned our initial deposit nor mentioned it, and has threatened to find new tenants if we do not supply the deposit by the end of this week."
Company changing my pay after being furloughed due to COVID-19 So I work in Texas and was put on furlough for about the last month and my boss called me to ask if I could come back to work. I was excited to go back to work however they are now changing my pay rate from salary to hourly and changing my employment duties. Before I was entry level with not very much training as I just started in February. Now they have me taking over sales territories in Tyler and in Houston while not wanting to pay for travel expenses and took me off salary “in case they don’t need me for a full week”. This all seems like bullshit to me. My pay rate is still the same hourly but I’ve lost pretty much any desire to work for these people. I should also mention they’ve only brought me back because I am currently the lowest paid team member and giving me responsibilities I’ve never been trained to do and aren’t in my offer letter. Is this all legal? Or are they just being scummy and exploiting me.
"Canceled an order and they still shipped it to my place. Received no fund and told me multiple times it was canceled. So I bought a PC last week and canceled it for a refund. I verified with them multiple times and they told me it was canceled/refunded. Though, they kept dodging my question about a confirmation number of the canceled order and they never gave me a receipt. My order page was also never updated about it being  canceled. 

After asking multiple times for a receipt of the canceled order they still never gave me one. Out of nowhere the PC was shipped to my place yesterday. I also never received the refund and I feel like they're dodging my calls/live chat. I would like to return this item and get my refund when I can get hold of them again. What are my options if I try to return this and they still don't give me my refund? They make up some bs excuse saying it got lost or they only give me a partial refund? What are my options? thanks, this is in USA btw"
"Procedural question California family court I’m going to try to be as succinct as possible.  I had a custody hearing 1/29 I represented myself against her attorney and won 50/50 custody.  The order was to adopt the fcs recommendation with one change in verbiage.  Nobody objected. The judge order her counsel to draft/file the custody piece and there was a continuation to determine the child  support modification. I went three weeks after and it hadn’t been filed. The Covid has delayed everything. Now I’m coming up on summer whe we were supposed to switch weeks so that it lines up the holidays for the coming year which was the verbiage I had then change and my ex is now objecting. There was no court reporter but there is the judges secretary taking minute notes.  Records are still closed. 

My questions:  would something like no objection to a fcs recommendation and what I requested be in the minute notes?   

What recourse do I have if I disagree to what her attorney doesn’t or didn’t make that change as ordered? 

Would you reach out the her attorney to tell her her client is confused and ask what she has filed? 

Is the attorney required to send the new order it to me before it’s filed so that we agree that this is what was agreed upon in court? 

Thanks I’m a freaking mess right now."
"Can I use a trademark (signing up for it) if one similar is dead/abandoned? Hello so I am starting a business and there is a name I would like to trademark. I will use the name candee for the example. 

When I look up the name candee in the trademark search only one result pops up. 

For the word mark it saids Candee International 

So does this mean that international is included in the name trademarked so I can use  Candee and not run into problems in the long run? 

Also other information is that 
- the company under goods and services saids (abandoned), 
-it’s dead (from what I understood because of payment issues) and 
-the abandonment year was about 25 years ago. 

Would I be okay to trademark the name without problems and if there located into the same state would there be a issue then?

"Pest Control Problems (Fleas) (Florida) I'm at a loss and don't know what to do anymore. My apartment complex has a flea problem that is affecting my dogs, wife and I. I regularly have my dogs on all types of preventatives, veterinary preventatives, over the counter, collars, ointments,  pills.  I've used preventatives on my carpet, flea traps and diatomaceous earth. The main problem is it is coming from the grass outside. I've found this out by giving my dogs a flea bath, taking them outside immediately after and by the time i bring them back inside they're covered again. I have also done the white sock test and watched them physically jump on my socks while I was outside. I've already informed the complex about the problem outside and they keep saying they're going to handle it but it's been months. At this point it has made it's way inside on to the carpet and it just keeps getting worse. My dogs constantly have fleas and it has gotten to the point to where the fleas are occasionally jumping on my wife and myself, and biting us as well. 

After speaking to the community manager asking for replacement floors, (She said she can't do that because we're on the second floor), asking to be transferred (She said no because she wants to fumigate and try and handle the problem with our carpet first). Or for them to just break out lease (She said no). We asked for a number for corporate but no one ever answers the phone it's just automated. She keeps saying she won't move forward with anything because she needs to fumigate first. 

Our problem is that with my wife is always working and myself as well we have no time to be able to move everything out the apartment for 4 hours. I work in sales for a dealership and we never have time off, like i actually have no vacation time at all so i can't ask off. And my wife might have a day or 2 off during the week, but there's no way she can move all of our furniture and things out of the apartment alone from the 2nd floor. we have no family that can help us with it because none of them live close and we don't know any friends here either that can help is with it. 

Even if we were able to move everything out for a day, nothing is going to prevent the fleas from coming back inside. They need to treat the complex. When I mentioned that she said that she doesn't know if she can..???? It's a never ending cycle. 

At this point I don't know if there are any legal options that we can take to help us with this.

I appreciate all the replies I receive, I will be at work all day and won't have much time if any time at all to reply to any comment but I will do my best."
"Upstate NY- bringing in an occupant who won't be on the lease? Hi all. 
Got a fairly standard question that I just want to make sure I understand correctly. I'm moving into an apartment in about a week, and want to bring my boyfriend along with me. His intention is only to stay while college is out, so it's not practical to add him as a tenant since he won't be here year round. 
The research I've done indicates that, in this state, I can have one non-blood related occupant, provided I inform my landlord in a reasonable timeframe. Is my understanding of this ""Roommate Law"" correct?  I appreciate the help!"
"Five months into living here I'm getting important checks and other important mail for the previous tenant Hi, 

Basically I moved to this state at the tail end of December after graduating college to start my new job beginning of January. When I moved here; I opened up my mailbox for the first time and had the previous tenants' junk mail; I didn't really think much of it and gave it to the head of management (we'll call her Sam); What should have  probably been a red flag was how shocked Sam was because apparently the previous tenant moved out August which should have been ample amount of time to change address to these places. I gave her the mail and we let it go... to be completely honest I didn't really mind the very few junk mail anyways I would just throw them away...As time progressed,  I moved to paying all bills online and stopped checking the mail as frequently. If I had gotten anything associated with her name that was junk mail I'd send it to the manager and eventually just stopped out of annoyance ( I would just leave it in my mailbox since most of it was junk mail ; Also, I stopped sifting through to figure out which ones I should send to Sam). Flash forward to yesterday ..after not checking my mail for almost two months Most of my mail if not all contsisted of work pay stubs, unemployment checks, a stimulus check, car bill notices, outstanding electricity bills for this apartment before me, and the rest was filled to the brim with junk mail...  I'm now fed up. I sent an email to Sam again and she will be taking all her mail to attempt to send to the previous tenant. I  passive aggressively told Sam to get in contact with this previous tenant and tell her to change all of the damn address; it been nearly 5 months! So my question is...is there anything I can do about this? Can I cut it up or something because my patience has completely evaporated? Im super new to the state and this situation so I'm not exactly sure where to even start. I also should note it's the first time I've ever rented an apartment."

"Copyright infringement/ How to use reddit stories as an inspiration for your upcoming graphic novel Hi! I'm new on reddit but I've read about Reddit's copyright regulations for the content the users post on this site, so I understand you can't replicate it without the domanin's approval. However I'm curious if using the  stories posted just as an inspiration for a collection of short illustrated narratives would infringe copyright.

I took a recent interest into creating suck a book but I thought about just referencing the stories and evolving their plots (not citing direct words, exact scenarios, names, places etc.) I would probably exaggerate some to the extent that they couldn't be tracked back to the original content.

By doing so, would I be stealing intellectual property?
I plan on getting all kinds of tales about experiences in the field that interests me in other ways as well by interviewing some of my former coworkers about the topic and asking on social media for stories if people want to contribute.

Would writing as a disclaimer that all the stories are inspired by experiences of colleagues of the trade but are partly fictitious be enough to not become liable to lawsuits?

Also, I don't know if it's worth mentioning but I am not a citizen of the US and I'm not residing there. I'm from Romania (small country in Europe.)

"What is the statute of limitations for violating an order of protection in New York? A friend of mine had an order of protection placed against his (now) ex-girlfriend in New York in 2016.

For the past 3 years or so, my younger brother has had his “old high school friends” coming into his twitch streams with accounts like “OPsBroisafaggot” “OPsbroisan1gger” etc. they come in and harass him and try to embarrass him. Each time the accounts get blocked, they make more. Last night they came back for more while he was streaming with his new girlfriend and humiliated him in front of her. He came into my room with tears in his eyes asking for help and I didn’t know what to do. 

I talked to a local police officer and he said there’s close to nothing the police can do and since “just deleting his account” would make the harassment go away. 

My brother makes money, sometimes a couple hundred bucks a month off of his twitch account. “Just deleting the account” would be like shutting down your business because the local drunk won’t stop coming in and the police won’t do anything.

"My friends parents are gaslighting her and had her commited I have an adult friend (21+) I have known for a few years. After confronting her parents over childhood abuse they had her committed. Her parents are very controlling and had her leave San Francisco County and stay at their house in San Jose. 

Her parents co own her condo in SF and have keys to her place, so they came over and convinced her to leave SF and go to SJ. Upon arriving in SJ they said she needed to take a bunch of meds and they called to get a prescription from her psych. The prescribed some sort of relaxing pill , and she told her doctor she does not consent to taking this. 

So after a day at her parents house she told them she wants to go home to SF and they said no. During a car ride she asked for them to let her out of the car and they restrained her and said she couldn’t leave 

Upon the end of the car ride she gets back to her parents house and eats a meal prepared by her parents. She falls asleep and wakes up a few hours later. 

When she wakes up she again asks to leave their house in SJ. They say no. She says I want to go to the hospital , they said no. So she decides to tell them she’s feeling suicidal and if they don’t take her to the hospital she will kill herself. She said she wrote a suicide note. She says this was a lie and no note was ever written 

So they called the police and the cops came. My friend is adamant she started to comply. The police asked her if she was ok and she said I want to go to the hospital to escape my parents. Then the police said ok are you ready to go and she said yes. So the officer said , What drugs have you taken if any? Friend says no, and then her mom chimes in “ she took an anti psychotic”. My friend told the police she never took that and told the officer she expressly didn’t consent and she asked the officer “is that legal? Can she drug me”

The cop said it’s legal if it’s prescribed. At this point she still thought this was a joke being played on her by her parents. 

So then she was admitted to the hospital, and eventually they wrote that they found a suicide note. She was kept at the hospital for 7 days for paranoia and delusions. During the stay she kept saying I wasn’t suicidal but her families input said she is delusional. 

After she is released she goes home to her apartment which her parents and her own. 

At this point her parents have said they will randomly come and do home checks on her, without her consent. She is worried that if her parents begin contacting her therapist and psychiatrist again, they will be able to have have her committed once again . 

What are her options to make sure her parents do not harass her anymore in her apartment? She is not manic or delusional or a harm to herself no others- what should she do? I suggested she change her locks and file a police report detailing her parents harassing behavior.

"A dealership ""stole"" my car, can't contact them, any advice? I towed my car to a dealer in Los Angeles, CA on March 16th. They stopped responding and I could not get in touch with them (left messages, no response, etc.). I was then notified weeks later (end of April) by Hyundai corporate that the dealer shut down permanently, and towed my car and about 60 others to a storage facility. There were lien's placed on our cars, and there are mounting fees to get them released.

**The dealership is claiming the cars were abandoned after giving notice to owners, although we received NONE. Hyundai and the storage facility have also confirmed that others facing this received no notification, and they are fighting with the dealer to try and release the vehicles quickly.**

I am now facing my car potentially being sold out from under me on May 28th when the lien takes affect. I am trying to working with Hyundai corporate to pay the storage fees to get my vehicle released, but they are now claiming I have to work with the dealer...who I cannot get ahold of.  There are at least 60 other people in my same position.

The storage place is now asking for **SIX THOUSAND dollars in CASH** (no payment plans, no checks, no credit) to release this vehicle and stop the lien from taking place. There are many, many people who can not pay that outrageous sum who are now at risk of their cars being sold out from under them. The storage place confirmed that only a few cars have been able to leave storage and Hyundai corporate confirmed that those people had to pay it out themselves. 

I'm trying to figure out the best course of action, whether class-action, sue them directly, file a police report, etc. Any advice?

"Illegal Dealership Fees in Georgia Hey everyone,

I'm trying to figure out what to do in regards to purchasing a new motorcycle.  In the state of Georgia, it is illegal for a dealership to advertise the price of a vehicle and then tack on extra fees such as dealership fees and whatnot.  Only government fees can be added afterwards. The links to the law can be found in several locations here from the state:

 [http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/Auto\_Informer\_-\_Issue\_13\_1.22.2016.pdf](http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/Auto_Informer_-_Issue_13_1.22.2016.pdf) 

 [http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/pdf/AAEP\_-\_Revised\_102518.pdf](http://consumer.ga.gov/uploads/pdf/AAEP_-_Revised_102518.pdf)  

I have already been to several dealerships to purchase a bike and they all say the fees aren't illegal at all.  That's how they stay in business.  However, when I show them the law that states all fees have to be included in the advertised price online minus only government fees such as tax tag title, they all just say I'm wrong and they won't do anything about it.  I called the governors office and they said I can file a report on each dealership but they only act if either A) I have a contract showing they added fees afterwards or B) they get so many alerts from people that shows a trend. 

My question is, what would ya'll do?  Do I just suck it up, pay the fees and then go argue it in small claims court since the law is on my side?  How can I get the state to enforce their own laws or even the dealership to see reason?  Apparently every dealership is still doing this. I just went through this two months ago on a new car for my wife and the dealership took all the fees off the moment I pulled the law up and they of course played dumb."
"Can I legally get my things from my dads house after I’ve been kicked out? Long story short I’m 18 years old living in Nevada and my dad just kicked me out of the house. I’m doing fine, living with my mother right now and got most of my items, clothes and such, before I originally left. 

The problem is I left a few things over there that  I wasn’t able to fit in the car at the time and I would like to go back and get, mainly my office chair, my guitar and some candles, nothing major, but when I asked when would be a good day to come back my dad refused to answer me. 

So, legally, can I just go over to his house and collect my things? I still have my key so I can get in just fine. My main issue is that he had previously threatened to call the cops on me when I was trying to leave originally cause I was taking my computer, which had been a gift from him. So could he do that? And could he stop me from getting the rest of my things?"

Just woke up at 3am to my doorbell to see a huge fire on my porch, someone left a bunch of cardboard and paper there and set flame to it and sped off before i could get a license plate. If i call the police is there anything they can do? i’m assuming this is highly illegal but i’ve no idea what statute it falls under or what can be done about it. Without a license plate is there even a way to track down the culprit??"
"Vacation Rentals My extended family and I (about 25 ppl) have a vacation planned for mid June in the outer banks of North Carolina. The family members are scattered throughout the eastern US. For obvious reasons we would like to cancel/postpone our trip. The realty company and the trip insurance company are playing hardball and telling us since the state of North Carolina is welcoming visitors beginning May 16th there is no reason why we should cancel. They want us to pay in full by May 14th (we have already paid half as a deposit). I should note that NC reopening includes a ban on more than 10 people in public settings. It wouldn’t apply while we are in the rental house but we would obviously like to be together at the beach. 

A few people in our group are in the medical field and would have to quarantine upon our return to PA if that makes any difference for our situation. 

Is there anything we can do given the circumstances to cancel or postpone the trip and get our money returned??

Thanks!"

"Trying to get full custody of my son to prevent any contact with his mother’s “new” boyfriend, who is a serial abuser For context, both his mother and I are 24 and live in Iowa. He just turned 5. 

If you want the full extended story I recently made a thread, but basically, my sons mother got back with her abusive ex (who has “changed”) and was always loving to my son. He never hit her in front of my son, and she never filed an official report on him, but she did tell friends and family about the incidents. Unfortunately I can’t find any screenshots of her clearly admitting to the abuse.

A lot of the comments said the courts needed to get involved, but I’m feeling a bit inexperienced and overwhelmed. Do I need to just hire a lawyer and explain my story? Do I go to a firm and ask for advice? (Is that even a thing?) I’ve heard that Iowa is a pro-mother state, but after talking with a few people I feel confident that with enough witness corroboration I’d be able to keep my son away from this man.

I’ve never been to court in my life, and don’t know much about anything legal, so I really don’t know what my next course of action should look like."
"[PA] Stranger found property, won't return Location: Pennsylvania

I carried a personally valuable item in my purse for months back and forth on public transport on my commute to school. It disappeared about 3 months ago.  (Presumably, it fell out on my bag, but, under these circumstances, I can't know for sure?)  My name was on it, so I filed multiple missing item requests at the station, at my school, etc., but nothing turned up.

About 6 weeks after losing it, I got a message on Facebook from some man a few towns over that I don't know.  (It's public, has been routinely active from 2011 onward, so I *presume* it's a real one, and matches with someone else's identification).  He told me that he'd found my item on public transport and wanted to return it.  I was delighted and got back to him right away and followed up shortly after with contact info and an offer to pay for the shipping, as well as an offer to meet him somewhere public if that was easier. I also offered a thank you reward for the trouble.  He saw the messages right away (read receipts), but never responded.  

I've been messaging him every ~ 2 weeks with polite reminders asking him to either contact me or mail it, and read receipts tell me that he has seen them, but there has been no response. If he did in fact find it on the public transit, he's been holding it for over 3 months already.

It unsettles me because it's a personal item and therefore feels violating; it includes info from my finances and mental health.  It is also strange to me 1) that it took him 6 weeks to message me in the first place, 2) that he didn't give it to a conductor for Lost &amp; Found and instead took it home...(??), and 3) that he went silent immediately.  It doesn't add up neatly.  

According to PA Title 18, Section 3924, holding on to mislaid or lost property when you have the identifying information of the owner and, with intent to deprive the owner, do not make reasonable efforts to return constitutes theft.  I care less about whether he is actually charged and more about whether I get my stuff back.

I was advised by family members to file a police report.  Is his Facebook profile and his admission to having it enough info for the police to get involved, or won't they bother?  What recourse do I have with the circumstances handed to me?

TL;DR:  Stranger says he found my property, but won't respond to messages about returning.  How to proceed?"
"Cutting University Group Members for Product Continuation Originally posted on r/cscareerquestions but was removed and directed to post here.

Hi All,

I had a question regarding potential legal pitfalls of venture I am considering undertaking. I am a university student, and for the past semester have been working on a software project in a small group for a class. For the final deliverable, we produced a working prototype of the software, and after demonstrating the idea to professors, friends, and family, I decided that I would be really interested in moving forward with the project beyond the class and attempting to release the software, with the possibility of incorporating monetization somehow. I talked to my friend in the group and he felt the same way.

However, we would like to keep the other two group members uninvolved in the continuation of the project. They quite frankly did not contribute very much during the semester, and my friend and I strongly believe that we would work much better without them. In fact, if they had to be involved for any reason I would rather forego working on this project and spend my time elsewhere. In terms of contributions, the other two members only completed one or two mock business elements for the class and a few slides on our final pitch deck. Neither of them contributed any code that made it into the submitted deliverable, and contributed &lt;20 lines each in total throughout the semester (and yes, the project in total was thousands of lines of code). I did a vast majority of the code, while my friend handled the designs, wire-frames, asset creation, and a bunch of the business stuff.

Bottom line is that the two of us would like to continue working on this project beyond the scope of our class which is now over, but we want to cut out two of the group members who didn't contribute much despite being ask to several times and given many opportunities to do so in multiple areas. However, we wouldn't want this to come back and bite us in the rear, legally speaking, if we were to publish the software especially if we monetize it. Ethically speaking we are totally fine with the situation since the other members were very hard to deal with and earnestly did not contribute, but we don't want to get sued or anything (we both live in the United States if that makes a difference). Are there any considerations we need to take if we move forward, or is this something that we should not do unless everyone is working on it?

TLDR: Want to publish software made as part of a university project and potentially monetize it. Also want to cut out half of the group from the class who didn't contribute. Could we get screwed?"
"[IN] My neighbor’s have a ‘motion triggered’ flood light that shines directly into my guest bedroom window. Asking politely has had no result. The light is above their side driveway, as the garage faces that way, and when anything triggers it (like a deer) it pops on and stays on for about an hour. It’s really bright and focused - like car headlights on high-beam and shines across their driveway and DIRECTLY at my guest room window.   

I’ve asked them nicely to tilt it - they told me absolutely not and to “get better curtains.”  I have both blackout curtains and blinds; it’s still awful.   

This isn’t a *new* problem; it’s been this way since they moved in about two years ago, but my guest room is going to be used regularly now as we have COVID quarantine-guests who may be with us for many more months.   

Do I have any rights here?"
"Can a company require me to wear a worse mask than what I am already wearing? Recently my company has distributed masks with their logo on them, they are simple masks that are not as effective as the one I was wearing previously. However, they are requiring us to wear their masks because they have the company logo and want it to be visible (likely a public image stunt). I would like to wear my N-95 mask instead of the cheap cloth one. I don't care about suing, I just want to be safe."

If we registered our domicile as their address (understand requirements there), what would be their exposure?

"Company promised training is now closing my factory permanently So about 3 months ago I signed a contract with my company that said they would pay for a training course ($4,500) and travel arrangements (tbd).

Well now that they announced closure of my factory I followed up the the institute where the training is and they tell me the course was never paid for.

"Company ghosts me until I get cancel payment with the bank, then they mail products anyway. (I'm located in Pennsylvania, USA)

So I ordered from a company and way after their already extended timeline I reached out to find out what's going on. I waited until way after their customer response timeline, nothing. I reached out by email and 3 different social media sites. I called the number on their website just to be given another number by an automated message, calling that one and finding out its down right now. At this point I had had enough and so I canceled payment with the bank. I messaged them again through multiple channels to let them know I had done so. All of a sudden I get a message back on Instagram from them and the rep tries to buy me off with ""expedited shipping"" (already signed up from 1-3 days shipping before) and a free ashtray, but I could cancel still if I wanted to. I, again,told them I had already canceled with my bank and I wanted this order canceled on their end too. The rep doesn't respond. Later at 9pm I get an email saying my order has shipped! The next day the rep says ""Oh sorry it's shipped now so it cant be canceled"" That was last week, I checked the tracking and they've only printed the label but its still there in their warehouse and hasn't been touched by USPS. I have time stamped screen shots of all of this.

I'll refuse the package if I get the chance but its often delivered when I'm not here (although lately I am) or just delivered at the top of the driveway by the mailbox since its a very steep hill and I have no idea until I pick up the mail later that anything has arrived. On top of that, my mailbox is near the road and we have had things stolen or damaged. I don't want to be financially liable if either happen, nor do I want to go through returning it because any communication with them has been beyond frustrating and I'm surely not going to pay for the return. I also have a severe chronic illness that makes it difficult to be away from a bathroom most times so going to the post office would be difficult and family that typically helps are either extremely busy (moms a nurse) or cant come around me because I'm extra at risk for COVID-19. Legally, am I obligated to be responsible if I'm unable to refuse or send it back?  (To be clear I have every intention to refuse it)"

If I receive an offer, I'm not sure what the reperucussions would be on my ""gardening leave"" status and my severance package. My former company has sent me a severance agreement and it makes no precise mention of accepting other employment during this time. However I imagine if I accept employment during this time I must:

- release all claim to severance

"[TN] Apartment/Tow Company illegally towing vehicles I live at a student apartment complex in Murfreesboro, TN. I have lived here for about a year and a half and my vehicles have been towed 3 times during this span. The first two times were settled before reaching court and were just for my out-of-pocket costs. The third time happened earlier this year in February. They towed my vehicle and refused to repay me for my expenses. I have seen this occur to many other individuals at my apartment complex.

I have tried reaching out to attorneys in Murfreesboro and most of them have not responded to my emails or said that they don't handle these types of cases and referred me elsewhere. Therefore, I am now looking into pursuing litigation in small claims court and have had many questions arise. 

Do I need to file suit against my apartment complex since it occurred on their property and went against our lease, the towing company, or both? If I contact them again to negotiate a settlement instead of going to court, can I ask for punitive damages/ reparations for breaching the contract in addition to my out-of-pocket costs? Lastly, if I do have to take this through small claims court, am I able to request them to reimburse for all court costs?

I'll be glad to clarify any details and I greatly appreciate all responses!"

"Ants ants ants The title says it all. I (21f) live in the basement apartment with my boyfriend (22m) and newborn. For some background info, we used to live in the main floor apartment a year ago but moved and then moved back here but to the basement. The landlord is a family friend (parents neighbors family to be exact). When we lived upstairs there was no problem with bugs or anything. We didn't even have any problems in our current apartment at all before but when I gave birth the 25th, we weren't at home for 2 days. The day we came back or the next day is when I noticed ants in our closet area which surprised me because my sister cleaned the house for us for our arrival. I don't know where the ants came from or where they are coming from. As far as I can tell, they're only in our bedroom and bathroom except there is so many in the bathroom (I just killed a whole bunch in the bathroom). Is it our responsibility to take care of the ants or can we tell the landlord that there's an ant problem and that he needs to take care of it? If it is his responsibility, what should I text him? Sometimes he wants me and my boyfriend to do things ourselves, for example, upstairs had their bathroom leaking water into our bathroom walls and he wanted me to scrape the walls till he got someone to take care of it (I haven't done it yet and he hasn't sent someone over yet, this happened a month ago probably). I realize this might be normal since it's getting nicer out and we live in a basement but still.. I don't want ant bites or ants in general. We live in Indiana"

"[California Ticket Advice] Window Tint offense listed as a second charge with my speeding ticket two months ago, front windows are at the legal limit. Simple as the title.

"Hr block ""tax professional"" filed my taxes without permission and cost me a lot of money Around the middle of march I walked into an hr block office to have my taxes done. This is my first time claiming a dependent so I wanted to have it done professionally so I didnt screw anything up. After meeting with one of their "" tax professionals"" and being happy with my claim, they attempted to efile it. The main reason I wanted to efile is because I didnt have the money right then to pay for them and they were going to take the fees out of my return. My return was rejected due to my dependent being accidentally claimed by my fiance, we filed separately. I was told they could paper file it but the money would be due that day or that I was welcome to leave and come back when it was figured out. My fiance submitted an amended return and I was waiting to see if I would still have a job before I spent a weeks paycheck doing my taxes by paper. Ended up losing my job and I saw the tax deadline was extended so I figured I would wait a little longer to see if/when I can return to work. A month after my initial visit I found out the ""tax professional"" used my previous information to efile my taxes without claiming my dependent. My address had also changed in that timeframe and they used my old address. So when I finally got my federal return it was about 5000 dollars short. I never gave them permission to do this or even file my taxes.  Of course the tax professional took her 500 dollar tax fee that I never agreed to. This also affected my stimulus payment as it was mailed out to an old address. I have my mail forwarded to my new address but I read that irs mail may not be forwarded and I still havent received anything. My state taxes never showed up either. I know I will have to file an ammended return but this cant be legal right? I'm planning on going to their office first thing in the morning to get this sorted out but need to know what to expect.

"My boss wants me to give back a months worth of pay after he already skipped paying me for 2 weeks Hello everyone I could use some help with this situation I’m in. For some background: I (19M) recently got a new job at a marketing agency. With everything going on I considered myself very lucky to have gotten hired here just days before everything shut down. I am a freshman in college going for a computer science major so this job really fit me and my degree. 

I met my boss after 1 phone call where he hired me on as a 1099 contractor. I was perfectly okay with this as I like contract work more than actual jobs. However, about 6 weeks later the virus started sweeping the nation he wanted me to come on as a full-time W2 employee. This was exciting because I’ve never had a full time job before. Especially exciting because of the projects I will get to work on. 

Now for a little more context: I had been paid a single paycheck throughout this 6 week period. Contractors are paid monthly instead of every 2 weeks. So I was expecting another payment in about another 2 weeks. 

However, he informed me that because he was moving me from a 1099 to a W2, that the IRS would find this very sketchy and they would audit him. He informed me that he would have to increase my pay for one pay period and that I would have to pay back the equivalent of whatever I made in the first month of being hired. This ended up being about $1,600. I don’t really know anything about the IRS or why this would look sketchy but I agreed. This is when he informed me that I wouldn’t be paid for 2 weeks that I had worked before the transition. I had worked about 120 hours in those two weeks. So it would have come out to about $750. That might not be a big paycheck for some people but that’s a car payment and half of a month of rent for me. 

And then, after all that, he tells me that he’s not going to be increasing my pay and IN FACT I’m going to be a a salaried employee so I will be only paid for 40 hours a week. So not only am I losing the 2 weeks of pay, I’m also going to have to pay back the first $1,600 so in all I am having to give up about $2,350???

Can someone explain to me what is happening and what the heck I can do to keep from losing this money? I know everyone is going to tell me to quit but I really can’t afford that right now. This is the only workplace in town that goes with my major, also everywhere else is closing or going out of business due to the virus. 

Thank you for your help. I’m sorry if I’m not very good at explaining this but everything I’m learning is through him and my parents."
"Shorted on my pay, app I'm working through claims that it's acceptable So I've been working on this new app called Wonolo. It allows you to take all sorts of different jobs as an independent contractor.

I did a bunch of jobs at a big pharmacy chain. At most of the jobs the staffing agency that sends me there never informed the store I was coming nor were they aware that such staffing agency even existed and there usually isn't much work to be done.

On most occasions, the managers would send everyone home early. There isn't enough work to be done in a small store for the employees so they generally can't find things for three extra people to do for 6 and a half hours.

Now, in the app, jobs are usually advertised as a flat day rate pay. I have seen jobs advertising an hourly pay, but all the ones I've taken were the flat day rate.

In this case, the job was advertised as $97.50 total pay. Nowhere else was there any indication that pay would be hourly. Generally, the staffing agency had been paying me in full.

Now, the last four jobs that I've completed for them they've begun to pay me less than what was advertised.

This is the latest response I got from Wonolo:

""When you sign up for the app, you accept the Terms of Use that state you are an independent contractor. Please see Section 3.

 

As an independent contractor, Wonoloers may be paid by the hour the same rate, no matter how many hours he or she works; is not covered by the employer’s workers’ compensation insurance, and may shoulder additional tax burdens. 

 

It also states therein that ""Wonolo does not pay a salary or hourly rate but rather facilitates Requestor’s payment of the rate set by the Requestor;""

 

Since the job that you accepted at *staffing agency* had a disclaimer ""We will be validating payment off of the store timesheets."",   this implied payment is in accordance to the amount of time spent on each job.

 

Though it may not have explicitly indicated an hourly pay but it was clear from the disclaimer alone that payment is subject to confirmation or validation, depending on the timesheet information. This would justify accurate payment for a Wonoloer who worked 1 hour against one who worked for 6 hours.

Can they really just do this? I'm absolutely disgusted that in the United States in 2020 crap like this can happen so easily. I just want the rest of my money."
"(TX) My boss mentors/helps prisoners and I've been asked to place a newspaper ad for one regarding divorce/debt but I'm having trouble finding out if it's even legally worth it On mobile, so sorry if there are mistakes/formatting issues. 

As the title says, my boss mentors prisoners and helps them out quite a bit if they do get released. One of these guys, located in Texas, recently got out and married a women he had met while he was incarcerated. Unsurprisingly, they're having issues and he now wants a divorce. According to him,  she is running up debt in his name, so he wants to do something that would insure he's not on the hook for that debt. He sent a letter to my boss, who then passed it on to me, to get it placed in their local newspaper (my boss and I are not in Texas). The letter basically states that after March 31st he will not be held liable for any debt incurred under his name. He also states that the divorce is declared April 26th and she has 20 days to respond to the ad or all community property is given to him. 

Now, I'm no lawyer (obviously) but this does not at all seem legally binding to me. I like to do my research on stuff before I go back to my boss with ""this won't work, here's why, and here's what actually needs to be done."" But, I'm having a difficult time with this one. So any help/advice would be very much appreciated. 

Questions/extra info:
1) Last I heard, he has not actually filed for divorce in a court
2) I just received this info a couple days ago, so even if it's legally binding if posted in a newspaper, can it be backdated like that? Can divorce papers be backdated?
3) If it's possible to separate out debt incurred after a certain date, I'm assuming he would have to have some kind of proof that she actually used his information to open the accounts?
4) Would he be completely screwed by trying to navigate this divorce without an attorney?

If it would be helpful for anyone, I can include the letter he wrote to be posted in the paper (with names redacted of course)."

"[AZ] Worked on app for a group project, they want to monetize it but it was my idea. So I had to come up with an idea for an app in my compsci class and people could sign up for it. A bunch of people signed up for my app and we worked on it before turning it in at the end of the semester. 

If I'm being honest, I did majority of the coding and UI for the project. My teammates essentially only helped with the write-up portions of the project that we had to turn in for a grade. 

My team is now discussing putting it on the app store and trying to monetize it, but I am concerned. First off, this is my app and I did most of the work, so I want to have primary control over the app. 

I want to know who this app legally belongs to and who has the rights to use it? Since it was a group project, can any of them legally take the app and try to monetize it?"
"Marijuana possession &amp; paraphernalia (Ohio) Hey everyone, got myself into a bit of a pickle. I was smoking yesterday in my car (turned off, keys in bag) in an empty metro parking lot and a cop pulled up out of nowhere. Knocked on my window said he saw me hit my pipe. I was compliant, &amp;amp;amp; didn’t lie. I gave permission to search my vehicle, I told him he would find a small glass pipe and less than a gram in the middle console. The police officers were making statements like “yeah.. bet your parents don’t know about this.” (I’m 21 so not really sure why he said this?) I told them I live with my bf most of the time but that my family was okay with it just as long as it was out of the house, etc. My person was searched &amp;amp;amp; rights were read to me before everything. The police officers were very nice and expressed appreciation of compliance, and ultimately I was cited with possession of marijuana (minor misdemeanor) and possession of drug paraphernalia (4th degree misdemeanor). They said that I was not under arrest &amp;amp;amp; that I’ll just have to go to court &amp;amp;amp; the “leader” officer told me I’ll have a court summons in a month about it all. I told them I was within walking distance of my parents house and they told me to just walk for a bit and to come back to pick up my car in a couple hours myself.

My boyfriend &amp;amp;amp; I already started looking for lawyers that same night. This is my first time offense and I’m wondering how far I’m stretching if I aim for diversion &amp;amp;amp; expungement from my record. I’m just worried because I am in my third year of nursing school &amp;amp;amp; have five jobs that alternate throughout the year to pay for school.. looking for any help please..

TL;DR: was sitting in my car (off) smoking a pipe in empty parking lot, cop saw me &amp; searched me and car. Less than 1 g in car &amp; 1 pipe. No OVI, etc. Looking for advice, TIA! 

Edit: 4th misdemeanor was for knowingly possessing marijuana &amp;amp;amp; minor for paraphernalia

"Got caught receiving drugs in the mail, scared shitless at the moment Basically the title. I had a cop knock on my door this afternoon around 2 pm and I played dumb about not knowing shit about a package but he said he knew it was coming to me and basically since it’s coming from another state they’re more interested in catching the dealer than me. 
I already attempted to contact a lawyer but his office is closed. 
Any advice about what to do next would be great. I’m in my mid twenties and I’m not trying to go to jail over this.

"Manager expects me to cover dine and dash bills. A few months ago I had a table that didn’t pay their full bill. I handed them the book with the bill, walked away to give them time, and a minute later I see them walking out the door. So I go and grab the bill and check and they still owed 5 more dollars. 

At this point they were still outside but I knew I wasn’t allowed to chase them out, so I went and told my manager(not the GM). When I told him about it he told me “that sucks”. So at the end of my shift I have to go to my manager after counting my money and give what I owe. 

I tell him that I’m going to give him everything minus 5 dollars because the table didn’t pay it. My manager immediately looks at me with an expression of “excuse me?”. He says “well who’s going to pay for it then?”. 

I tell him the company will pay but it’s not my job. He starts to get an attitude with me and tells me that it’s my job to pay for dine and dash no matter the bill cost and that I should always be in my section. 

He says that I should always be watching my tables 24/7 and that I should have counted the money before they left. All of this is not plausible. I have to go in the back to run food, get drinks, and if a table isn’t in my section I have to tend to them. I can’t be standing in the middle of my section it doesn’t make any sense.  Not to mention I have other tables to pay attention to.

And as for counting the money in front of them I was never taught that in training and I know that no one in the restaurant does. You take the book and go to the computer system. He was saying that it was my fault...but even if I catch up to someone who had not paid the bill before they leave I can’t stop them. 

So one of my coworkers was in the office as all of this was going on and she told me that she always counts the cash in front of them(which I know for a fact to not be true) and that she always pays the dine and dash bills. 

As she’s telling me this two other co works tell me that they have covered bills for dine and dash as well and that’s just the way it works. At this point I feel like all of this is illegal and these people are just paying out of pocket without even questioning anything. The whole conversation I was being belittled and spoken to in an extremely rude manner. 

Later on I ask other employees and they say that I don’t have to pay for dine and dash and that they have never had to. So at this point I’m extremely upset and as I get home I do some research and the law is a little different state by state but what I got out of it was that it in fact is illegal for my employer to take my tips. 

I get that it was just five dollars but it was still my money, and next time if it’s 50 or 100 dollars they will expect me to pay up. 

I would really appreciate if someone could clear up the law for me a little better and give me advice on what to do next time they try this on me again.

"My FFL was arrested &amp; charged while they had my gun. Like the title says. My FFL was raided, arrested and charged by the ATF. It happened the day my gun was delivered. Not sure what to do next. I contacted the local PD and was a able to get an agents email from them. I sent him a message wanting to know what I should do to retrieve my property. To my surprise he responded the same day. He asked for all my firearm information. Also he stated once it’s all inventoried he’d let me know more after.

I’m located in Texas and this happened one week ago if that makes a difference.

Should hire an attorney? Or wait for more info from the agent? Any insight is greatly 
appreciated."
"Copyright law/ old music re-released out of nowhere Hi! So my band from upstate NY has been together for 10 years, in 2013 we released a fairly poor quality album recorded by my uncle who had never sound engineered before. It was the proudest achievement of our lives up til then, even if listening to it now is more of a cringy experience than anything else. That album was largely forgotten off of the internet, and I made our YouTube videos of that era private. We were young and matured as people and a band a lot in 7 years. We would also release an EP in 2015 that did alright and we look back on it fondly and still market it.

Anyway, in two weeks we are dropping our new EP. We have been working and marketing hard. Out of nowhere, I google our band name and all of our first album pops up on YouTube, Shazam, Amazon, iTunes. On YouTube I saw it was supplied by a company I haven’t heard of.
We don’t want this old stuff out and we don’t want them to have rights to it or whatever... to be honest I’m just looking for some advice on what to do and what to expect. Should we make moves to try and get our songs off of these platforms so that we can distribute them to future cult fans? I am leaning towards yes but I appreciate any help."
"TX- Medical professional Three years ago I made a medical error as a new nurse that resulted in being reported to the Texas Board of Nursing. After three long years, both parties came to an agreement. An order was signed by myself, my lawyer, and the board.

Last week the board broke that contract by not abiding by a specific rule in the order. It resulted in the head of the entire company I work at being notified, where multiple disciplinaries work, not just a medical team. In other words the board sent out notice to the absolute top guy in the entire company, not even specifically my supervisor. It resulted in my supervisor being upset, angrily calling me, the entire situation forwarded to HR and the company’s legal team, and inevitably the entire team finding out. One specific detail my legal team worked hard to complete was the agreement not to notify employer, which was signed by all parties then breached on their end.

What, if any, repercussions does the board face for this breach of contract?"
"My significant other (and every classmate of hers) is being denied loans for not attending Nursing clinicals, despite the fact that all of her classes are online now. My girlfriend is currently about halfway through her first year of nursing school, yet obviously Covid has made a dent in things.

So they can’t technically do clinicals because of Covid, yet they’re still doing online classes. 

The school has marked her as “unsatisfactory academic progress” despite her acing the course so far. She’s dependent on these loans to get her through school. 

Are they allowed to do this?"
"Forced abortion/Unwanted pregnancy mess   


# Pregnancy and relationship

📷

Thankyou to whoever is taking time to read it. Its long but precise enough to help me with some advice.

I had a relationship with my ex for two years and we broke up due to some family issues. After a while he lied to me and it was all for another girl. I started drinking with my friends and one day( July 2019) I met one of my friends friend ABC. (I will keep the name ABC to avoid identity bad mouthing). I kinda liked him and started flirting (even though I wasn't over my ex- my first mistake). ABC look quite disturbed and eventually he shared what was wrong with him. He had financial issues has his Immigration status was going to expire. He was short of 3000$ and I started trusting him so much in few days that I made an arrangement for the money he was short. In a few days he had issues with his roommates and he moved out. I asked him to come to my place. My ex and I share a dog in common and he use to come visit him. So whenever he use to come I asked ABC to sleep outside because I didn't want my ex to think ill of me. In a way I mistreated ABC. One day two of my friends came to see me from far and we went for dinner and it was too late for them to drive home. So I asked them to sleep at mine. They came and ABC thought I slept with one of them which I didn't. He started having character issues with me and meanwhile during that process I started realizing my mistakes and fell In love with him. He started getting abusive day by day, violent, humiliated me in front of his friends, even showed his pe\*\*s out of his pants in front of his friends and asked me to have it if I am too much into sex. I still continued facing all that because of the guilt I had for mistreating him. Me and ABC weren't dating and it was all physical because he wasn't interested In me. Dec 2020 we had unprotected intercourse, and Feb 2020 2nd week I got to know I am pregnant. I was ready to abort it but was waiting for some financial support from back home. mean while I had an ultrasound and got attached to the baby and didn't wanted to end the pregnancy . I told ABC about it and gave him full assurity that he would never even have to pay a penny for the child. But he started calling me names like prostitute, child eater and stuff like that. Now he is forcing me to abort or he will make my life hell. What should I do. I am getting depressed and helpless day by day. He sleeps in my room and I sleep on the stairs. I am just too scared to hear those words again. He even said that he never enjoyed getting physical with me( after 9 months ) and he just did it so I wouldn't go to any other guy. He says I planned pregnancy against his will. I have appoitment proof for abortion, pictures of injuries from his abuse but do not want to get him in trouble because I love him. I do not want to loose my child at any cost. I asked him that I will sign the papers that you won't be liable about anything but he is not listening.

I honestly do not want Child Support or anything to do with him. I just want my child.'"
"(MA) Employer is asking me to go back to work before my state officially re-opens. Just as the title says, my Employer has asked me to return to work to “prepare” the store for reopening. But here in Massachusetts the official start of reopening non essential businesses is still a week away. 

I live close to the New Hampshire border and previously they asked me to work in a NH location that reopened last week, but I refused because I was uncomfortable with that for various reasons and  told them I was going to follow the MA health guidelines and they accepted that. 

Now they are asking me to start on Monday, although MA is slated to “reopen” May 18, and thats not even set in stone. We are in no way essential, we are a sporting goods store. 

What is there to do? I have tried looking online for other people in a similar situation (which there must be), but the only thing I saw was that if I believed my business was illegally open I should call the DA, but they are closed. 

As a side note: Only the store managers of each location were not put on furlough so that they could fulfill online orders, if that matters."

"(Washington) - Public employee, unused comp time not paid Hey there. Throwaway account because my supervisor knows my regular handle.

I work for a public agency in Washington State. Our state allows public employees and employers to agree to comp time in lieu of overtime pay. I am an hourly employee and for years I have had an arrangement with multiple supervisors that I would work overtime and accrue comp time that i could use for a variety of reasons. I have come to find out that accrued comp time is supposed to be paid at 1.5x after 26 pay periods of not being used. I did not know this before today. We're talking like over 200 hours here.

I have recently been laid off, but I have a job though August. My employer is refusing to pay unused comp time. They say there was nothing in writing. I had a verbal agreement with 3 supervisors and I believe all three would testify to that fact if brought to court as witnesses. They told me that I was free to use the comp time between now and August if I want (impossible to use it all). But I think they know they can't force me to use it.

In the absence of a written agreement, how screwed am I? It's all tracked on a spreadsheet I maintain. Because we are a public agency, we keep records of EVERYTHING. I'm sure i could find references to the comp time in various emails going back as far as 7 years.

Even though the agency calls me an exempt employee, I do not meet the salary test or duties test. I am not paid the same every week regardless of what I actually work. If I work 26 hours instead of 40, I get paid for 26 hours. I am not an executive, nor am I administrative, ""professional"" or a ""computer worker."" I have no independent decision making authority.

Edit: I stopped accepting comp time in summer 2019 and have evidence of the agency paying me overtime since then."
"Amazon refunded me for a lost package and then it showed up. Hi, I ordered 3 iPads for a work project and after waiting about 2 weeks past the delivery date they still never showed up. I contacted Amazon Support and they resent me 3 replacements that arrived promptly. Another two weeks or so went by and the original 3 iPads just showed up and Amazon sent me an email confirming the delivery. Will they recharge my credit card now for the 6 total I'm in possession of instead of just the 3 I originally ordered? Also, I have not received a message from them asking for a return or anything else. Is there anything I should be aware of before I contact Amazon customer support? 

Thank you."
"Can my driver’s license be revoked? [TN]

So, I’ve got an unpaid speeding ticket from... I think last year. I couldn’t go to court then for a few reasons (I won’t go into detail as to why, but I will say it was related to school... nothing bad). So, I just sort of ignored it, then recently I was informed that it had been sent to collections. 

Long story short... can my driver’s license be revoked if this goes unpaid indefinitely? I know the amount is under $200 (around $190 if I remember correctly)."
"How, when, and where to start an expungement process of an arrest in NJ? In October 2018 I got arrested for possession of 2 counts of marijuana (0.6 grams and a vape pen). I spent about 5-6 hours at the police station in handcuffs. Months later my case got dismissed. I’m currently in the process of applying for nursing school, however, I’m worried my arrest will show up on my background check and negatively affect my chances of being admitted to the program. I know Gov. Murphy recently signed a bill regarding expungements that goes into effect on June 15 but I wasn’t sure if it applied to my situation because I was never convicted.

Cash app stole my money They blocked me for no reason. And stole 1134$ I contacted the BBB they responded immediately telling me I can WITHDRAWL the balance. Funny part is that if I hit standard WITHDRAWL it says failed. If I hit instant (to pay 18$) it says card not supported. I’ve tried over 25 cards. Contacted the BBB and my Atourney general in Ohio. We are in a pandemic and they stole every penny I have I lost my housing bc me and my roommate got into it I’m homeless with legit no money it’s been 3 weeks now and they responded right away when BBB contacted them saying I can WITHDRAWL my funds but I can’t!!!!! And I’m waiting on the AG to get ahold of them and me. I rejected their response with the BBB. And I was told to contact a non profit laywer for this. But I’m so upset and heartbroken.

"Navigating Preferential Rent Rider During Covid-19 [NYC] My lease is up and I have been unable to negotiate new terms with landlord. It is currently rent stabilized with a preferential rent rider. 

Due to covid-19 I temporarily relocated out of city and am unable to schedule moving until after the lease is up. I have offered to pay the preferential rent during this time. The landlord  refuses to allow a month to month. 

If I need to become a Handover tenant to take the necessary time to move my belongings:

1. Will the landlord now sue me for the full legal rent?
2. Can they sue me for monies owed if they sign new tenant and are unable to get tenant in there before I can move out?"

"Apartment Parking Lawsuit/ Collections So I lived in an apartment in Los Angeles, CA during 2018-2019. My girlfriend was the main signer of the lease, with her mom as a guarantor, and I was on the lease as occupant. The first apartment manager working there was very chill, lenient with the rules. Super nice guy. The parking in the building was paid PER CAR, and open parking, meaning no assigned spots. You paid monthly for your parking pass, and parked anywhere in the garage. The apartment manager gave me a garage gate key, and told me not to worry about paying the extra parking fee. I had never paid this fee, I guess he thought my girlfriend paying for her one spot was enough money spent for the both of us to park there. Like I said, really chill guy. 

The problem arises after we moved out. I had parked in the garage throughout the entire duration of the lease. A situation happened where the original manager was fired, a new manager took over, and corporate managers started heavily managing the building. This was a mess. Everything changed. The living situation became uncomfortable and we even got them to agree to cutting our lease short because of all of the problems we were having there, but we didn't end up moving out early because of the headache. So we stayed throughout the lease duration. 

After we left, everything seemed fine. About a week later, a ludicrous bill comes in for painting fees and overdue parking fees. We contested the painting fees, as we have a walkthrough on video of the manager saying everything looked fine and they even marked down a chart saying there would be minimal fees for screw holes in the wall. The unpaid and overdue parking fees came as a huge confusion. I was told not to worry about it! I was given a parking garage gate key and was never once asked to pay the parking fee while living there!

Now without contacting us much about the bill, they have sent the parking bill to collections, under my girlfriend and her mothers name. They knew the parking bill was because of my car. I was on the lease as an occupant. They have my information. I believe they're specifically going after the stronger party who holds more money and assets on purpose. On top of sending it to collections during a global pandemic, which I suspect is because they're down money on rent because tenants can't pay and they know they can't do anything about that. 

I'm asking for advice on what to do here. Does this bill need to be paid? Is this legal for them to do? They sent it to collections with minimal contact to us, from my understanding. Can I have the bill placed in my name instead? What's my best course of action here? Thank you all!"

"Will I Go to Jail? I (34F) was in Food City a few days ago. Getting some things I needed at home. I was standing at the cash register, not even finished ringing up the items, when the Assistant Manager comes up behind me. She tells me I need to come with her. I finish what I am doing and follow her. She takes me to the Managers office. There, they tell me they are pressing charges for shoplifting. I didn't even have anything I hadn't paid for. They called the cops. I am questioned and then told I need to come to the police station. When I arrive there, I am told I will have to appear in court. My question is: how did I shoplift when I was still at the cash register, and I never went out the door with anything I didn't pay for?"
"Google Meet, asking for permission and legal status of the conversation Hello,I  wanted to know whether a Google Meet conference call could be considered public just because I shared the conference url on my facebook wall, for example.In this regard, please mind that the link in question wouldn't grant you of direct access to the conference call, but rather it would bring you to the Google Meet conference page where you could ask the admin to let you in.

My thinking is: unless you're allowed by the admin, after your access request, or unless you were invited in the conference call via google Calendar event, then you have no right to know what the content of that conversation was, am I right? The link might have been somewhat public (shared with all those who had access to my facebook wall) but the call itself was private, because you could only access it if let in by the admin.

To say that it was public just because the link was posted on facebook, is as to say that every home and building is accessible because there are doors and windows, right?

Also, keep in mind that the conference call wasn't even live-streamed.

Thanks you all in advance!"
"Auto Dealers Fraud has been Destroying my Credit for years  Six years ago when I was young and naive, I got talked into financing a $30,000 car. I remember being shocked at how easy and fast the financing process was, as I initially thought I’d get denied due to my bad credit and low income. During the whole entire car buying process I was not asked for, nor did I provide any type of identification, proof of insurance, proof of residency, or proof of income. I was given a one page application to fill, talked for a bit, signed a contract and drove off. Being as this was my first time buying a new car, I guess I let my excitement of getting approved outweigh my skepticism of the whole experience.
About a year passes and I receive a call from my mother (whom I haven’t lived with in years) saying that Bayport Credit Union called her and said they put a forced coverage on my car (due to accidental 30 day lapse in insurance). I then proceed to call Bay Port CU, and during this conversation Im asked if I’m still employed as an electrician, at this shipyard two hours away from where I was living. This was extremely odd to me as it wasn’t even close to what I put on my application (waiting tables). For the next ten months I had to pay an additional three hundred a month  on top of my car payment.. another 6 months later and I couldn’t do it anymore so I told them to come get my car. 
After they repossessed my car I checked my credit report and discovered that they have falsely reported 9 different late payments in a years time. I have (and still do) bank statements proving all 9 of those payments were on time as I had reoccurring bill pay set up. 
As if that wasn’t bad enough, a year latter I get a call from my mother (once again), saying that they delivered a warrant in dept to her address summoning me to court for the remaining outstanding balance after the car was auctioned off ($9000) and $2500 in court fees.. 
I went to court and got a judgement against me. 
Now, six years later I still feel defeated. 
How do I best handle this situation given the circumstances? Will going to court hurt my chances at getting this fraudulent account off my credit?"

Long story short, paypal couldnt verify that he received these so no refund was issued.

"I really need help and advice This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. A little  backgground I'm right now a 25 year old extremly anxious and depressed male. I've always had bad luck with women, and when they come in my life I try everything not to lose them. I've even been often times questioning my sexuality. Maybe I try so hard with keeping people around because these women are my ""beards"" Idk. Some more background too is that I started at a 4 year college then took a year off, after having a mental breakdown and attempting suicide which resulted in a being placed in a pysch ward. A huge issue I have is saying no to people, and just in general being too nice. Also this is in New York.

Not that the background is out of the way. Basically a few years ago this whole nightmare started a few years back, I matched with this really pretty girl on Tinder. We talked for a little bit, and I ended up taking her on a couple dates. She gave me a blowjob (Which I didn't get hard for) and I went down on her. A few months later I got a phone call from her dad and literally my stomach dropped so far when he told me her daughter was underage (15). This happened when I was 22. A couple months later she reached out to me again and apologized. We were talking and this girl is really intelligent. we just kept being friends which was not smart on my part at all. I later went back to college and I started seeing another women who is my now girlfriend and is amazing. But this is the part that's really bad. The underage girl was now 16 by now. She starts this off by telling me ""I want to send you a pic, but I can't"". and me being an idiot I tell her go for it. She sends me an underwear picture. 

This caused the situtation to spiral like crazy. Basically we sent nudes literally all the time while I was dating my girlffriend. I was even sending nudes to guys. (I've talked to my girlfriend about some of this). It was really bad, I didn't realize it but I was kinda grooming her. Which is awful, I just thought I was being nice and we were having fun. This went on for 4 months. It didn't stop until her friend called me up and told me how much of a piece of shit I was being. It took that to make realize, and take a step back. 

I thought that I did enough to protect myself. I deleted all social media and blocked her from my laptop (I have a mac). But not on my phone. Now this girl has contacted just recently a few times. Since quarentine has started maybe 5. (She follows my girlfriend on instagram, so the calls typically come when my girlfriend makes a post. Ususaly I ignore the calls since they're really late at night. But I picked up one, last month and she calling me a sexual predator, and that I was the adult. And really laying into me about it about how much of a garbage person I am.  She called again last night, I picked it up and talked to her. She told me how she learned the grooming and that i groomed her. (which is disgusting). She told me about how she was thinking of messaging my girlfriend about everything. But what I'm getting to is she told me she talked to people and she told me what charges I could be looking at. She said she isn't sure about pressing charges. I want both the girl and I to be at peace. I told her that.

What my question is, is what can I do to protect myself? I've told my best friend everything. I didn't try to sugarcoat anything. He really recommended I stop contact. A

"Can the petitioner of a protection order approach the respondent? MN My friend Chuck has an order of protection against him in the state of Minnesota. This was initiated by his ex girlfriend, Sally. Recently, I was with Chuck. Sally came up to Chuck’s car screaming at him that he needed to leave and she would involve the police that were around the area. When Chuck and I were at the same event she was at, Chuck did not know Sally was or would be there. We were at the event before she arrived. 

Honestly, I’m not sure of all the details but I do know it’s an order of protection and not a restraining order. My question is, can she do that? Can the petitioner of a protection order approach the respondent?

I’m sorry if there are any details you all need that I have missed. I will try to clarify if necessary. Thank you all."
"Craigslist Purchaser Scam? I've got two items listed on Craigslist and got a response from each with both sounding very similar. They both said they would pay full price plus extra to hold it for them (I didn't ask for any extra), both said they couldn't come and see the item but would send someone to pick it up and both offered to send a check. I know taking a check is a big no no, but the one guy said I could wait until it clears. Still, I told them both no checks. This is a scam right?"

"I'm receiving daily death threats from my husband's ex and I fear for my life I'm a 22-year-old pregnant woman and I live with my husband(23-yeas old) and his housemate in Boston, MA.  
I created this account and I'm posting in this subreddit because a friend told me she received very valuable advice here when she needed legal advice.  
My husband and I got married last year and we are expecting our first child. Everything was perfect until we heard that his ex-girlfriend moved to Boston, we thought it was just a coincidence, but she started showing up at my workplace, at my husband's university and even at my parents' house.  
And as if stalking us wasn't enough, she somehow got my number and started texting me. The first texts were just verbal attacks and didn’t worry me at all, but these verbal attacks turned into death threats in the past weeks.  
She writes she'll shoot me in the womb so that my baby dies inside of me, that she'll hire someone to sabotage my husband's car and even threatened to set our apartment on fire.What we can do? will taking these texts to the police station help? what can be done during this COVID-19 crisis?"
"Furloughed but being contacted for “help” I was furloughed a few weeks ago, but my boss and others on my team have been texting me to ask me questions about my work, asking me how to do things that I was previously responsible for, asking me for links or files, etc. At first, I was responsive, but then told them I’m not available for work matters while I’m furloughed. That has not stopped them. The last email from my boss started with, “I’m not asking you to do any work, I just am hoping you can tell me how to do...”. I am a knowledge worker, so replying to email and phone messages about projects or duties IS work. Do I have any legal recourse here? I am worried that things will be difficult if/when I return because I was unwilling to pitch in or offer guidance. For the record, I live in the U.S. in the state of Texas and I am a salaried employee. Thank you in advance for any helpful advice.

Edit for details: 1) The emails and texts are to my personal email accounts/phone. 2) I can’t contact HR because my boss is an HR director— there is no internal recourse. 3) I have replied and asked not to be contacted about work matters while I’m in an unpaid status. I have said that I do not want to work for free. The contact continues."
"[Michigan] Homestead Property Tax Exemption/residence transfer My mom (67) is retired and has been living with my sister to help raise her kids after losing her home to foreclosure (it was underwater). It’s now time to get her into her own place, but her credit is shot from the foreclosure and subsequent bankruptcy. 


I’m (Work in Chicago, Illinois) well established financially (stable engineering salary, solid savings, no debt) and intend to finance a home ($40k down on $185k home) in New Buffalo, Michigan for my mom to live in. Small and modest with a big back yard, where she can live out her retirement in a stress free environment. 

Michigan property tax is quite high for non residents. Michigan has several property tax exemptions for primary residence, which would really help keep the monthly payment reasonable (I’ll be splitting it with my mom). It seems that I could transfer citizenship to Michigan and register that as my primary address with my employer, then claim the homestead exemption and my mom would live in the home “with me”. 

How complicated is this, and what other options are available? I would consider putting her on the title as a coowner if that’s possible, but I would need to be the sole mortgagee. Would that allow her to unlock the homestead property tax reduction? Wondering if anyone can chime in and provide some guidance or advice before I seek out and pay for legal assistance. 

Thanks so much!"
"Can I legally use a band name inspired by a video game series? Hey all,

My friend and I are thinking of creating a band with a name inspired by a character class within the popular Final Fantasy game franchise. I checked the trademark of the specific name with the USPTO, no trademark filed. Of course, the Final Fantasy name is trademarked.

Is it possible to use a name from within the series without legal issues? I'd like to learn about band name legality inspired from already established fictional creations.

I'm located in Los Angeles, California.

I appreciate any thoughts."
"Possible wrongful termination (NV) advice I worked at a large bank for nearly 3 years. I was exceptional in sales goals, customer service, and never once disciplined for any reason during this time. I was promoted 3 times. 


In March 2020, I decided to file an HR complaint on my branch manager. The company requires us as employees to report possible illegal or unethical behavior. I was moving to a new role which involved traveling and would soon not work under the manager. I knew of inappropriate behaviors and sexual encounters between a banker, mortgage rep, district manager, and teller, and heavy favoritism based on romantic reciprocation. Those behaviors had become extreme when I decided to report. I hesitated for a time due to the potential of retaliation. The teller did not reciprocate and in turn was not treated as well. My complaint mentioned this and other well known details by others so I could remain as annonymous as possible. The manager and myself had been friends as I did not want to give myself a difficult work life, but his behavior on countless occasions was not appropriate and often sexually driven. 


When i spoke to an HR investigator about the treatment of others, issues of favoritism, and an inappropriate work relationship, the investigator seemed only interested in the excessive gifts the manager bought a coworker he was romantically interested in. He had twiced asked her to go on a date with him and admitted so, when that is strictly against bank policy due to conflict of interest. I knew this coworker was not romantically interested in return but didn't want her exceptional treatment to change. It was found that the manager was written up for the gifts. In banking, gifts to clients, coworkers, or mortgage partners insinuates possible bribary, legal issues, and unfair treatment. 


This bank also has an extensive ethics policy handbook that can be found online. Early on it preaches the ""do the right thing"" and ensures anonymity(when possible) as well as a zero tolerance policy for employees who are retaliated against for filing a report. The HR investigator I first spoke with told me to reach out to the regional HR representative if I experienced retaliation.


Somehow my identity was known only days after the report and the manager as well as other coworkers were extremely upset for me blowing the whistle. I was treated terribly and excessively micro managed which I had never experienced before. I was scolded and asked to forge paperwork(i believe was an attempt to fire me then but i refused) I documented the incidents that were blatantly wrong with the witnesses and forwarded them to the regional HR rep, as instructed when you experience retaliation. I then speak with another HR rep who doubted my allegations, but all were confirmed by other employees who witnessed some. Weeks pass and the treatment continued to an unbearable level, and I began to take anxiety medication to cope and even told the HR rep I had clinical depression and anxiety and the hostile environment was becoming too much to for me. 


I then was told I was being forced to relocate to another branch this manager also manages 50% of the time. It was not the branch I had applied for and I planned on working. It was then I emailed the regional HR a final time saying I felt nothing was being done and I would not tolerate the retaliatory treatment any longer. I also explained the manager has had many sexual relationships at work and also made me uncomfortable on numerous occasions. I then got a final call from a 3rd HR rep who asked more about the sexual misconduct/harrassment. I gave her names of witnesses and people who knew or saw the same things I did. This was never followed up on. I asked one coworker who experienced inappropiate sexual conduct if she was reached out to, and she told me she was not. It is my understanding all companies are required to in good faith investigate all sexual harrassment claims regardless of their feelings on probability of the incidents. This did not happen and this bank claims to follow through on such claims in addition to retaliation. From what I have read, most companies lose lawsuits by default when they don't investigate protected activities correctly.


I moved to my new role and location and would still see this manager in passing but we did not speak. I felt things were improving but I was also on a project that didn't involve interaction with him. During my first HR investigator call, I sent text messages and work messages supporting my early claim. After the complaint of retaliation I was never asked for more evidence nor for any regarding sexual misconduct. I was asked for names and the bank did not ask those individuals about the accusation. 


On Wednesday April 29, the company sent a mass email to all employees putting dollar amounts on gift giving, I am assuming because of my original HR complaint.

No one was ever disciplined regarding my complaint(less a minor write-up) but instead the company revised its policy. On Friday, May 1st, the district manager came in at the end of my shift and put me on a conference call with the regional HR representative. In a minute or less, she told me I was being terminated as the investigation was closed and they found I complained in bad faith. She also added I had said unkind things about coworkers but did not say who or when. For months I had kept to myself and always treated my coworkers with respect while we worked together. Had they fired me for any other reason(as a model employee they could not find anything it seems), I know I would be screwed due to being an at-will state.

I am seeking your advice and help as when I draw this map together, I realize none of this would have happened if I didn't ""whistleblow"".... The sequence of events I believe proves this as well as ignoring a sexual harrassment allegation and well documented retaliation. I see a huge issue after reading state and federal guidelines for whistleblowing/sexual harrassment/retaliation and see a large difference here vs a typical Nevada at will termination. I made reasonable attempts with my employer through the proper channels and policy to correct this, and the employer responded negatively and retalitory. I am a realist and am not sure if this is worth fighting and would appreciate that guidance. As far as ""bad faith""... I was moving branches and had nothing to gain from saying anything...i have plenty of proof of my allegations...my goal was to protect future employees and create a fair environment for the ones there. My employer without a doubt in my mind can't prove I reported in bad faith, and I was ultimately let go for whistleblowing and being a liability if these behaviors continued.

I am seeking impartial advice about legal recourse. Do i have a case? Does it fall under whistleblower, retaliation, or sexual harrassment protections? I am totally okay with moving on with my life...it won't bother me either way if I pursue legal action or not. However it is no secret banks often legally f*ck up, and this particular one attempts to protect its reputation at all costs."
"Beehive on neighbors property. Sorry if this is not appropriate for this sub.

My husband and I own our home in Southern California. There is a behive in a cinder block wall that separates the property between two of our neighbors. It is not on our property. The hive is a few feet away from our property line. Our backyard patio is littered with dead bees, and we sometimes get live bees in our house. Sometimes they swarm and it is not possible to go in our yard or use our pool. I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old and I'm worried they will get hurt and our pets aswell. We have spoken to both neighbors. The hive is more on neighbor A's side. When we spoke to him he said he has been trying to deal with this for years and they keep coming back. He said he has tried poison spray, spraying them with water, and has sealed up all the holes with cement but the bees always return. He said there is honey in the wall. We offered to pay for a professional removal service but he basically blew us off. My impression is that he has been dealing with this for so long he does not believe anything will work and is not willing to try. I asked if he had ever called a professional service and I couldn't get a straight answer out of him. He said he called our city animal control and they did not help. We have spoken to neighbor B. He said he approached neighbor A and got basically the same responce. Neighbor B says he routinely sprays poison to help keep them under control but they keep coming back. Neighbor B is in agreement with us that we need to call in professional help. I know it is illegal to kill honey bees in California. I called our Orkin service and they have a beekeeper associated with them that they refer bee problems to. I'm waiting for them to contact me. I have neighbor B's cooperation but this problem is going to require access to neighbor A's property and the block wall may need to be destroyed or damaged for the removal. Is there a way to force neighbor A to cooperate? I don't know who owns the wall. The block walls were put in when the houses were originally built in the 70s."
"[AZ] Ex housemate I do not speak to any more because of her abuse is demanding I send photos of her and her kids I took when we lived together. I do not have them any more. Her lawyer bf has sent me a letter threatening legal action. How screwed am I? About 12 years ago my then gf and I lived in a share house with another couple. It worked well for a short time, but of the other couple the mother had an untreated problem with major paranoia and hallucinations, I'd guess something schizophrenic (but I'm not a doctor). She accused me of trying to take her bf, accused my gf at the time of doing the same, accused her bf of a relationship with her mother, she'd walk around the house arguing with herself loudly for half a day at a time, with episodes sometimes weekly.

I took photos of everything at the time, including her and her bf with her kids on good days. I gave her copies of all the photos.

My gf left me because of the stress and moved out, and I couldn't move for another 8 months because of the lease, but as soon as I could I noped out of there. It affected me more than I thought at the time, and took years to regain enough trust to live with anyone else again. During my recovery I deleted massive portions of my life from that time; emails, photos, everything. I'm doing OK now, and have a new partner.

The ex flatmate tracked me down at the start of the year and in a sweet well written email she told me she's lost all the photos she had that I'd taken and wanted copies of the files again. I ignored it and deleted it straight away, but she kept sending more emails, from different accounts. I ended up replying and told her I'd deleted them all and no longer had them.

This week a physical letter arrived to my street address from her new paralegal lawyer bf threatening to sue over the loss of the photos. I've checked her facebook and the legal firm, and her bf on facebook is the same one listed on the firm's site.

I'd hope she can't sue over something I never promised her I'd keep and that's technically my copyright. Am I screwed?"
"My House Was Condemned Without My Knowledge, Then was ""being fixed and I shouldn't worry, then I'm informed I have 48 hrs to vacate premises. This is a super convoluted long story and the title doesn't really do it justice whatsoever. I moved into my place with my roommate in Dec 2019. Like the place, there's a couple things wrong here and there, but we send in Maitenence requests and they're eventually fixed. back in march we start to notice water seeping into bathroom floors and walls. send in maintenance request, our regular guy comes 2 check it out, says idk! and leaves (which is fine, he's a cool guy and also not a plumber). flash forward to like April 15th, we get a notice on our door, dated march 10th that was a notice of condemnation or what have you. gives a list of reasons, broken glass on door, ceilings bowing in the basement, laundry hook ups have some sort of electrical problem, and oh yeah, sewage pipes leaking! so for the next couple weeks were texting this girl from the management company like uhhh any updates? nothing. talk to our handy guy and he says basically the landlord is a slumlord to us. march 7th, some plumbers come by, stay for like 20 minutes in the basement and leave and tell us nothing. next day I text another person from the management company about it, they say they have to replace the ""main stack"" and they'll have someone over tomorrow to do it. I said sounds good what about the other issues? he said he'll figure it out, essentially. so he texts me again and is like so yeah plumber coming in the morning, with a real estate agent, possibly the owner too. and im like ok by why? and he says ""idk I just work here"" lol. so I tell him im not cool with them coming in especially the real estate agent, plumbers fine. minutes later get a text from the girl from the mgmt company saying sorry for inconvenience but plumbers coming tomorrow w owner! and im like its not inconvenient just wanna know why the owner, and a real estate agent, are coming. she says to see the property value of the house. I said why do they need the property value of the house? she says she doesn't have to give me a reason. I say ok if there's no reason then they're not coming in. she said ""Read the lease"" (which btw, states that they cannot forcibly enter my house lol) to which I say the house is condemned, there isn't a lease. she responds ""City will make you vacate within 48 hours"". I seriously think she's just trying to act tough, and we have threatened to take them to court already, so they may be trying to scare us off. downstairs neighbors laughed it off, because keep in mind this isn't an eviction, they're saying oh yeah everything were gonna fix it, and then suddenly decided nah its condemned. so this effects them too. downstairs neighbors aren't worried. if this were to be serious though, what are my rights/what am I entitled to/ how do I proceed?

"Relationship with a former client So i’m having a dilemma. I live my mother and she worked a home for mentally ill/challenged adults. She was fired for being too close to the clients. While she was working she was sneaking a client out for walks and conversations in private, out of the house. A month goes by and she informs me that the client she was having a relationship is coming to stay at my house for awhile. She is no longer in that job anymore and the client is at my house as i type. She claims that it is only a friendship and nothing more, but she also a bit unintelligent and doesn’t realize how pieces of the puzzle i’ve put together. I believe they are in a relationship, possibly sexual. He is very broken man, with the mental age of a 10-12 year old. Am i legally able to get him out of this house, my mother will not budge when i try and tell this relationship is disgusting and unethical. Are there any laws that can force him out of here?"
"How can a beneficiary of an estate remove themselves? Long story short parent passed away (no trust, will, etc.) and designated adult children as beneficiaries to things like an old retirement and/or bank accts. There are no other assets/property involved. 

Said parent was in the process of updating beneficiary designations to one of the adult children instead of others (and all children would be OK with this arrangement). 

Is there any process or legal document or anything that others can sign to simply revoke their interest in the estate so they don't have to be involved in any of this process?

This would be for California, if it matters."
"My landlord cut off the electricity I’m currently experiencing power outage for about 4days! My roommate that used to live with me before the pandemic started used to pay for the electricity in our apartment, and now he moved to another place to live because our landlord told us to vacate the unit if we are unable to pay rent. With me this trick didn’t work, and I’m not gonna follow my (scared) roommate. I’m still staying in the apartment and got new account with ConEdison. I contacted ConEd and they said that I have power, but I still don’t have the electricity and I tried to switch on and off all the electric switches I have in my apartment and also went to the basement to find maybe it was turned off but I could not find anything. I called the super, and he is telling me that if I have a lease agreement and etc, I told him that I used to be roommate of a lease holder and I have roommate agreement and that I also got new account with ConEd and paid them. He refuses to help me and saying that I have to speak with management. I contacted my landlord and they are saying that I have to vacate or they call police, and they have to speak with their attorney! This is such messy thing and what a bullshit landlord! So, guys, if you know is it right to call police on them that they cut the electricity off and get electricity back with the police’s help????"
"[UT] Living in a condo and my neighbor is threatening to sue, but also will not communicate with me. This comes down to a noise complaint from my downstairs neighbor.

Somethings that have happened:

* They knocked on our door and screamed at me on 2 separate occasion threatening lawsuits. When I ask to talk about it they say ""NO!"" and scurry off.

* They have been banging their ceiling every night after ""quiet hours."" after the first time they screamed at me.

* Have left threatening notes about random noises, specifically threatening legal action. More specifically cease and desist letters or bringing in a lawyer.

Because of the screaming at me and the threatening notes my questions are:

* What can she do to me legally? (they apparently have a lot of money... or so they say)

* What recourse do I have to make her stop harassing me?

just in case you are wondering what the problem noise is, its a fan that runs during the day and I turn off at night to align with quiet hours. To combat their noise complaints I have been keeping a log of every noise I notice in the building with dates and times, just in case. But of course have noted date and times of my interactions with this individual. 

to note as well I have contacted the HOA I live with and they have said they will side with me on this situation. I am more worried about them threatening me.

Thank you

also I hope the flair is correct."
"Gift of Equity for Unmarried Couple TLDR; Dad gifting equity to *me* alone, boyfriend is concerned about his equity after resale.

My boyfriend and I are in the process of buying my childhood home in Georgia, USA from my Dad. My Dad wants to give *ME* a gift of equity as a type of early inheritance. He was adamant that the initial gift amount will stay only mine upon any resale of the house. My boyfriend is worried that the initial amount value of the gift of equity could go up or down depending on the resale value of the house and that he will lose some of the equity that he will put into the house. I'm wondering if this is a common thing or if there's any literature that may help us to better understand if this is a good idea or not. I don't think we would be able to afford this house without my Dad gifting us this equity. Any real estate lawyers out there with some guidance? TIA"

"Noisy neighbors are driving me insane, I’m desperate. Hey guys, I live in North Carolina in a apartment. I moved in about a year ago and a few months later my neighbors moved in above me. They have 6 people in their apartment (a 2 bed, 2 bath) and it’s three adults, and three children. The kids are 2.5 years old and twin 1.5 year olds. All day, every day these kids are sprinting around above me. Legitimately all day. For the last 3 hours alone the kids have been sprinting around and they are so loud and they pound on the floor so hard that my lighting fixtures rattle. It’s absolutely nonstop. Last night they were up at 0145, the kids got up and woke up the parents, then they got up and fought, then had sex until 0300. 
I’m at my wits end. My apartment complex follows local guidelines for noise complaints (only accepted between 2200-0700).
Please, is there anything I can do? I’ve made complaints, I leave as often as I can (given the quarantine), I can’t even sleep through the night at this point.

Edit to add: 

So I looked over my lease and there’s a line that states;

“19. Prohibited conduct; You, your occupants or guests, or guests of any occupants, may not engage in the following activities; behaving in a loud and obnoxious manner; disturbing or threatening the rights, comfort, health, safety or convenience of others in or near the apartment complex.”"
"Do you receive notice if you violate a deferred prosecution agreement (Travis County, Texas)? 

Hello,

My 18-month deferred prosecution agreement is set to expire in mid-June. I believe I did everything correctly, and I sent in all of my paperwork (proof of counseling, mental health evaluation, etc.) to the district attorney's office, more specifically their deferred prosecution department. Part of the agreement is not committing anything above a Class C moving traffic offense, which I have avoided.

I can't help but notice that I may have gotten an assessment about a week late, although I am not even sure if the stipulation applies to my conditions because it is much further down in the agreement. I am freaking out, but I don't know if I am being irrational.

After sending my documents to the DA's office, I was told that they had received my documents and that they would do a final review for compliance on the due date. I can contact them for my case status after the due date. They also reminded me that I cannot commit another offense leading up to the mid-June due date.

My main question is: would they have informed me if I had violated the deferred prosecution agreement when I sent in all of my paperwork? Am I in the clear as long as I do commit another offense until the due date?

If you don't know the answer, do you know of where I could go to find the answer to this? Any other suggestions to where I could go for help?

I feel pretty desperate and anxious, so I'll really appreciate any help/advice/answers you have to offer. I have no attorney at the moment, either."
"A fault on Amazon's website and customer services has cost me 26hrs of my time to prevent debt collectors being sent. Can i send them an invoice? I got locked out of my Amazon.es account after losing my phone which was used for 2FA. A fault in their system and procedures made it impossible to pay an overdue bill and they eventually sold my debt to a debt collection company.

In efforts to pay the balance on my account by other means i contacted their Customer Services teams in the UK, US and via twitter. I wrote to head office and contacted the jeff@amazon.com email address. All of which refused to deviate from a script and could only send me to the Amazon.es customer support page containing: 
- a phone number i couldn't call as i was on lock down and didn't have a phone. 
- An email which replied with a canned response sending me back to the page i began at. 
- A number of options which could open a chat window.. but i needed the linked phone number to login before the window would open. 

They refused to escalate the claim to anyone who could help me resolve it.

There was an option on their site to reset your 2FA account, but rather than via email it sent a message to the phone i was trying to reset, so was useless and just looped in a circle endlessly.

I've calculated that they've wasted 26hrs of my time because of a bug in their website, and the subsequent refusal of customer service teams in other countries to either take my payment themselves, or have the Spanish team contact me directly. 

I want to know if i can send them evidence and recommendations and invoice them for this time as bug hunting for issues in their system and customer services. Skills which i have utilised professionally in the past both in UX design, and business analysis, and i had no choice but to employ in this case or to wait for the debt collectors to come knock down my door."
Divorce by publication I had a question regarding this method as it seems to be the only way I'll be able to get it done. So a little back story. I was in the army and caught the wife cheating so I told her that she needed to pack her bags and go home. Stupid of me I should've finished it then. But I digress. Fast forward to now and she has a temporary restraining order that prohibits contact between her and my daughter and me. I'm just trying to move on with my life and I've been trying to get her to talk to me about it since she left and she just keeps giving me excuses. Due to the restraining order am I able to go this route as I have no way to contact her in order to get this done.
"Q: Automated TOS/legal agreement? Context: I am currently building an app that basically allows people to sign up for accounts, newsletters, etc in bulk. However, a potential hurdle is that when you sign up for stuff online you usually need to agree to a TOS or another legal agreement.

I was wondering if there are any precedents or best practices for apps/services that essentially create accounts/sign TOS &amp; other agreements on users' behalf.

I know most of the time people actually don't read TOS and legal agreements but they still usually need to click an option saying they accept or decline an agreement, etc. Would it even be possible for an app to have a blanket legal policy to enable this? Or would it have to come down to the users needing to manually read &amp; accept all legal agreements themselves?

"Employer is trying to prevent me from collecting partial unemployment. Hello! I hope this is the right place.

So, pre-COVID I was working 32-40 hours at a small company. During COVID, I had my hours cut to 25 hours a week, so I applied for partial unemployment (Texas Workforce Commission) because 25 hours a week is not enough to cover my bills and medical bills.

It’s been ALMOST long enough to finally request the actual unemployment (my filing day is Wednesday), but I just got word today that one of the higher ups at the company I work for is going to contest my application, and they’re going to say that I actually worked 39 hours this week and next week on my next check (next week Friday), even though I only worked 25 hours. I’m assuming so that it seems like I’m actually full time to TWC. They also informed me that after this pay period (Friday), they’re putting me back down to part-time at 30 hours, which still is barely under what I can comfortably live on. They’re acting like they’re doing me a favor, but it’s very obvious they’re doing this so I can’t collect partial unemployment. In fact, I’m not the only employee they’re doing this too. In addition, they informed me that I’ll receive extra duties, alongside all the extra duties I’ve received since I’ve been working from home. They let go my coworker a few weeks ago as soon as this started, so I’ve basically picked up the work of two people at almost half the hours.

What the hell can I do? Partial unemployment allows me to reliably live on what I’m making part-time, handle my bills, etc. I was already living check-to-check before, so even a 10-15 hours decrease is a good amount of money in my situation. I’m looking for another job ASAP, but I’m afraid it will be awhile."

I checked my credit score a few months back for the first time and i noticed a bunch of closed accounts that he opened under my name including a loan he took out to purchase that property in 1996. My dad was a pretty smart guy and had a lot of power and influence in our town. He got my cousin out of jail and got his charges dropped multiple times by paying the DA a visit. He always found a way to get around roadblocks and he knew people in power that could help him get what he wanted. I called some local lawyers and told them about my discovery. Here is where it gets weird. I had 2 lawyers tell me they are too busy to help me out with this after they found out I was the Son of my Father which they indicated to me they knew personally and gave me their condolences. Another lawyer said they looked at the property and that its not under my name and that it never was which I know is a lie because my dad himself told me already it was under my name and the Sales history shows it was for 20 years (from 1997 until 2017). I think the reason they don't want to get involved might be because there clearly was some fraud and whoever the Notary or Attorney was that validated the transfer might get in trouble over this and they might have some kind of loyal relationship to my mother-in-law which together with my dad had business with pretty much every lawyer in this small town or in this region.

My dads last testament states that he gives all the authority to my mother in law to do with his possessions as she pleases. The problem is that there is a action class lawsuit going against my dad's estate from some employees he owes $200k to, so things have gotten a lot more complicated. That property should not be part of his estate as he was the one that transferred it and signed the papers not me. Is there anything I can do to get that property back and if possible without getting anyone in trouble for fraud? I can't Trust the word of my local lawyers so i'm seeking advice on how to approach this situation. Thanks in advance.

"Abused as a kid, wondering if I can take legal action Hi, throwaway account because family knows my og. I (18f) was molested by my older brother from the age of 5 until I was almost 12, when my mother caught him. He's two years older than me, so he was 7 when it started and 14 when it ended. When I was a junior in high school, my friend found out about what happened and told a teacher, and CPS got involved. I lied to them because I had been told for years that I would be taken away and would never see my family again if I told CPS what really happened, so I told the investigator that it was all a big misunderstanding, and the case was closed.

I don't know if taking legal action against my abuser is still an option, or if me lying to CPS means that I can't report what happened to the cops? I know my mother told her therapist when I was younger, but he never reported to anyone, and my mom said that it was because it was 'kids being kids', and I know that she won't back me up if I go to the cops. I just don't want him to hurt anyone else. What are my options for legal action?

"How to protect my inheritance I’d like to start by saying that my wife an I have a very strong and healthy relationship. But it wasn’t always that way and she has up and left me twice in two years at the beginning. At the time we had nothing and the potential damage if it had come to divorce would have been negligible. 

As it stands now we own a decent sized house and all the things that go with it. Our finances are healthy and everything is peaches. I am about to receive a trust payout(?) of a quarter million or so and I worry about using that money for anything that benefits both of us out of fear of losing it if she leaves. That kind of money isn’t enough to set anyone up for life but I can’t help but think that if she decided it was over that the courts would likely give her the house (which I would finish paying off and upgrading with some trust money ~86k) and then I’d have half of whatever is left to buy my own home. 

So my question is this: is there some kind of paperwork or contract I can have written up that makes it so whatever I choose to invest in our joint assets she’d be required to recompense if she left me? I broached this subject with her after I learned of my inheritance and she seemed receptive and understanding of my paranoia. But I don’t even know if it’s possible to have a sort of “post-nup” and if it’s enforceable. Thank you for your time and expertise.

"Can I (f19) sue my roommates (m24 &amp; f24) for “stealing” my rent? (Location: Chattanooga, Tennessee) 

Before I was officially signed onto my roommates’ lease, they told me rent was $50 extra than it actually was. I moved in mid December so I paid $175 to one of the roommates not knowing I had given her $25 extra dollars for her to keep in her pocket. It was when I signed the lease that I realized my portion of the rent was only $300. I never actually lived there (I ended up moving in with my boyfriend) but I moved furniture in. I paid Jan, Feb, March and April’s rent early. Throughout those months I also paid a portion of utilities even though I wasn’t contributing to the cost of utilities. It was when I realized they were overcharging me by nearly $40 each month in utilities that I told them I wasn’t paying anymore towards utilities if they were going to overcharge for something I wasn’t even contributing to. (One of them also stole my pillow but not wanting to cause drama, I didn’t bring it up to them). 

Here is the problem. I just paid May, June, and July in advance but got a phone call today from the apartment manager telling me that my roommates haven’t paid this month’s rent. She told me they have also been late on paying every month since they signed the lease (a $100 late fee each month). Since they haven’t been paying on time, they owe a lot in unpaid rent and it is all coming out of my payments. They are basically stealing my money as their portion of rent AND the LATE FEES from their irresponsibly is coming out of the money I have paid in advance for my portion. 

The apartment manager sent me a document that she said was posted on our apartments door (that my roommates never told me about) saying our lease would not be renewed and that if we wanted to move out before the end lease date (August 31) we could and wouldn’t be responsible for anymore rent. I asked the apartment manager if there was any way I could get my money back since I’m not living there and have paid in advance for months that I am no longer obligated to pay. She said the only way I can get the money I am owed back it to get it through my roommates. 

So my question is, is there any way I can sue my roommates in a small claims court case for the rent they practically stole from me through their accumulated monthly late fees and not paying their portions on time and being short on what they owe each month?"
"OR - fence law (neighbor wants to build a new fence when we have a perfectly good one) My neighbors next door want to build a 7ft tall fence between our houses in Portland, OR to add privacy. We already have a perfectly ""functional"" chainlink fence between our properties and I have no need/interest in replacing this fence. The chainlink fence is not on the property line; it is about 4 inches on our property (land was surveyed). The neighbors are not asking us to pay for their new fence but they want to remove the chainlink so that they can build the new fence right on the property line. Can they force us to do this? We don't want to take down the chainlink and be responsible for future maintenance costs of the neighbors' new fence."
"Was sold a car from dealership that didn't have access to the title, and made no effort to obtain one for 90 days. Car was totalled after 2 months, and I'm stuck with insurance until dealership provides said title so the car can legally be registered. [AR]
Apologies if this isn't tagged properly, I was unsure which one was most relevant.

I purchased this car in December of 2019. In March, a distracted driver slammed into my car at 40 mph, totalling it.

When I bought the car, they assured that they would obtain the title within 31 days (The law in my state requires this for any sales.) After 60 days and several weeks of expired temp tags, we went to the dealership to check on the progress. They had made no effort at all to obtain the title. And almost refused to give us new temporary tags as ""That's not really how that's supposed to work.""
Then in April we visit again, asking where the title is. They showed us records of contact they had made to obtain it. They made a handful of phone calls and payments over a month after that 60 day meeting. Promised they would have it by the end of the month. May comes, still no title. I call the dealership, and the manager had heard nothing about my situation. The finance manager we spoke with before had either been keeping it under wraps, or they were both lying to cover themselves.

Meanwhile I've been racking up late fees on my auto loan and taking a credit hit because I can't keep paying for a car that 
1) Is no longer drivable/in my possession 
2) Isn't legally mine despite having put thousands into it already.

Yesterday, they finally obtained the title for my car and my insurance can begin to move forward. After their coverage, I am still out $2,500 on a car I was able to use for 2 months.
I paid roughly 18% of the total value of the car as a down payment, and had only made my first monthly payment at the time of the accident.

Do I have any options, here? The dealership sold me a car they didn't have the title to, and made no effort to obtain said title for over 90 days after the purchase, leading to a holdup with my insurance and settling my auto loan.

Do I just take the loss and move on?

"My mother isn't getting money from the department of labor We live in Lincoln, Nebraska

My mother filed a claim awhile ago since she lost her job at the salon. They were supposed to send something around $800 to her but instead sent $174. She tried calling them and all they said was that they will call her if they find anything wrong. It's been over a month and she still isn't getting any money. We appealed the claim and she is still waiting for the appeal to get looked at. She tried going to the Department of Labor, and they're closed, under construction, all that was left was a sign to call them or go to their website. She tried calling them, 1 hour, no answer.

"College student sister is collecting unemployment benefits even though she was not working before CA lockdown. Is this fraud? I live in CA, my sister is home from college since the lockdown started. Usually when she comes home from school, she works as hostess at a local restaurant. Yesterday she told me that she has started receiving $600+ weekly unemployment benefits, explaining that she has an agreement with her employer that when she is in town, she will have \~30 hours/week of work guaranteed. By her logic, if it were not for the pandemic she would be employed and that is why she applied. 

I am concerned that she is not actually eligible and this will come back to bite her. Since she left voluntarily to go to school, doesn't that mean she quit and doesn't qualify? Also, she wouldn't be home if it weren't for the school closing, so she wouldn't be working anyway if it weren't for the pandemic, so she's not actually losing any income. Furthermore, she is entirely financially dependent on our parents and has no living expenses, she plans on saving all the money to buy a car. I've tried to voice these concerns but when I bring it up she refuses to respond at all and storms off.

Is this fraud? What are the potential consequences for her if this is indeed fraudulent? Is it likely she would get caught and punished? I don't want for her to get in trouble with the law."
Im am going to lose my job soon. Place is getting sold and new boss doesn’t want me. So where I have worked for 6 years is getting sold. It’s a very small town maybe 300 people. But the new owner doesn’t want me on for now. Says he has his own crew? I’m very well liked by this community except this guy. He’s a shallow person I think. They want me to work there until everything is settled. But at this point I’d rather find a new job. A. That won’t work for me cause of the 30 miles thing and the hours I would get at this point in time.

I just wanted to know if I have to file before my job is gone or start now. I don’t watch news or anything that’s why I’m asking here. Thank you in advance.
"Do I have a right to take my dog from my family home? I was gifted a dog by my mom when I was 16, but I haven't been able to take care of her financially for the past 5 years due to the fact that I'm disabled.
My family has bonded with the dog, and if I trusted them I would likely leave her behind when I move out to not put her through such a drastic change. However, they don't do basic things like clean her water and food bowls so if I'm not at the house they'll let it get gross and unsanitary. I've decided to try to take her with me when I move, but they're telling me I'm not allowed to and that they'll try to legally stop me. I'm willing to fight for the dog to make sure she's somewhere I consider safe. 
My only piece of evidence is a text from my mother saying yes when I asked her if the dog was intended to be mine and a gift to me. Is that enough to take the dog or will they be able to fight me over it in court? I'm also afraid they'll try to prevent me from taking my cat as retaliation for taking the dog. They said I could take her, but not over text so I don't have any screenshots to prove it. Any advice?"
"(CA) Driver nearly hit cyclist as reversing into driveway As I was biking today, I nearly got hit by a driver and I was wondering if I was to fault for nearly getting hit or the driver and couldn’t figure it out. I was biking on a city road with one lane each way and parking on each side. As I was biking, a car on the incoming side of the road started to turn right to turn and reverse into a driveway. As I approached him in my lane, he started backing up and that is when he nearly hit me. I expected him to wait for me to pass before beginning to back up, as I was coming up to him and he did not start in my lane. Was I legally obligated to stop and wait or was I okay to continue in my lane. Looking back I should have stopped out of my own safety but I had assumed too quickly that he would wait."
"My dog bit my neighbor's dog and his hand - California  

I left for Costco with my partner and we closed all the doors but did not lock our door. This door opens inwards, but our dog managed to open it while we were gone, and ended up attacking our neighbor's dog. Our neighbor intervened and got his hand bitten.

He's a nice fellow, and I messed up by not locking my door. We each wrote written statements about the situation and are waiting to hear back from the office. He states that he is fine, and does not want to press any charges or pursue any kind of action. My dog does not have any other recorded incidences, and, if it matters, I definitely closed my front door shut.

This happened in California.

At this point, I feel like I will need to relocate my dog to a relative's home, but I fear eviction or things of that nature.

"(California) Landlord refuses to fix appliances during COVID19 Hello r/legaladvice,

I just moved to a new apartment owned by a leasing company and unfortunately a decent amount of repairs needed to be done (we were restricted from viewing this apartment or doing an inspection before signing the lease due to covid). Our toilet was incorrectly mounted and was rocking back and worth, and we asked maintenance to fix it and they did. Today we discovered our dishwasher wasn't working, and we requested that maintenance repair it. They called us back to say that they are only doing emergency repairs and that a broken dishwasher is not an emergency. This is apparently due to low staffing because of the coronavirus. 

Obviously, we can just hand wash our dishes, but this was an advertized feature of the apartment, and we absolutely would not have moved here if we had been told there was no dishwasher or a broken dishwasher. I have done a bit of research, and as far as I can tell, repair and deduct is a potential option in California (a previous landlord refused to fix a leaking faucet for a week and I did this). However, I don't think that a broken appliance constitutes ""inhabitability"" as expressed under that law. Do I have any legal recourse in this situation? I live in the San Fransisco Bay Area if that is helpful. 

Thanks."

"Possible California labor law violation in restaurant I work in an upscale restaurant in California where local minimum wage is the state minimum wage at $12 for under 26 employees and $13 for 26 or more.

We all make minimum wage at $12/hr and we have 33 employees in total. My thought is that we should all be making $13/hr but I was hoping to get legal advice on this before considering filing for a labor law violation.

Our restaurant is setup as follows:

Front of house

Manager (2)
Host (2)
Bar (6)
Server (8)
Back server (2)

Back of house

Executive chef (1)
Sous chef (1)
Prep cook (2)

Most on hourly pay are part-time. We are not unionized. I’m happy to elaborate more on what each station does if that matters. I couldn’t find any helpful information on exemptions that’d make this legal.

"Ex toxic friends have been lightly harassing me for nearly a year and what happened today is making me nervous that I might be in a compromising position So I was friends with this group of people for a while (around 8th grade- the end of my sophomore year) but I ended the friendship by ceasing communication with them the summer going into junior year because they treated me like garbage and it was seriously impacting my mental health for the worse (I have major depression, anxiety, and adhd that have all been diagnosed by more than one medical professional). This year at school was a bit awkward but mostly manageable with the occasional hearing them talking shit about me a few feet away or them giving me rude looks in the hallways, that sort of stupid petty hs bs. Anyways today- er, I guess tonight? Last night? It’s nearly 1 am as I’m writing this and all this happened like an hour or so ago. One of the girls in the old friend group has this family friend who’s extremely problematic and confrontational and he started texting me telling me to “pick up” and I didn’t know what he was talking about so I looked at my missed calls (my phone is always on dnd rn bc the notifs stress me out and I’ll know when to expect someone contacting me) and I apparently missed a call from this group chat that had all of my old friends+ my replacements in it. I started freaking out a little bit but I tried to handle the situation as cooly as possible, but then I saw this video. I don’t think it’s incriminating but I just wanted to check hence why I’m on here, but he sent me a video one of my old friends in the group took of me last year at a Christmas party we had together. I was dancing (we all were music was playing and it was a gathering between friends) but the video only captured the part of me dancing where I was grinding on the floor. Mind you I was fully clothed however the clothing I was wearing was revealing and in the video my skirt rode up a bit (you still couldn’t see any genitals or nudity or anything the person taking the video wasn’t that close to me and the video was taken in front of me not behind). I know this might me stupid to ask about but you really never know about this stuff in this day and age and I’m scared they’ll send it to potential employers and colleges and maybe even my hs swim coach and idk if it can get me in trouble. There’s no drinking or drugs in the video, there’s literally nothing else except for me grinding on the floor except like I said I was in revealing clothes and I was 15 when the video was taken (16 now). Also I was wondering if there’s any harassment or cyber bullying charges I could look into because this seems like that. I’d really appreciate if someone answered even to tell me I’m being an idiot bc this situation is dumb bc I’m just really on edge rn and I can’t think right."
"Mother with terminal cancer hasn’t prepared any end of life documents (CA) My mother was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer a year ago.

As far as I’m aware her only assets include a checking account, a car, a 401k, life insurance, and a storage unit. 
When end of life documents were brought up originally 6 months ago, she had me sign a form stating myself and my sister as the beneficiaries to her checking account. She never submitted this form to the bank and is still somewhere in her house. No other documents have been prepared. I have brought up establishing a will and medical power of attorney and possibly contacting a lawyer to help us with the paperwork.  She has said that she doesn’t have much in terms of assets and doesn’t think the paperwork is necessary. She is also very tired all the time and I know that none of the documents will be done unless I take initiative and do most if not all of the work. 
She is still mentally cognitive, but is declining every day.

"Furloughed in America 
Hi All,

Located in San Diego, CA.

I have a bit of a complicated scenario I’m looking for legal advice. I worked for a tech company for 7 years. I was the Marketing Manager for at least 3 years. My company hired a Marketing Director (my boss) two years ago. They then hired a content writer less than a year ago. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit I received an email from my COO, who also cc’d my Marketing Director, that my position had been furloughed. My Marketing Director called me within 30 minutes letting me know she had no idea I was being furloughed. She said she would write a letter of recommendation for me and that I should probably start looking for a new role at a new company. 

Fast forward five weeks later. I’ve emailed my boss (Marketing Director) three times now to follow up on her reference letter offer. She has not responded. I heard from a colleague she put in her resignation notice and today was her last day. I went on LinkedIn and saw our content writer changed her title (was promoted) to Marketing Communications Manager. 

I still have no update from my boss, COO, or CEO on the status of my employment. The now Marketing Manager has been given all my responsibilities (I know this as I keep in touch with current employees). 

My question(s):

1. What do you recommend I do in my position as far as company communication?

2. Is there any legality giving someone else within the company my role while they furloughed me?

3. Do I have a case or any legal action against the fact that someone below me has been put in my role due to the current pandemic?"

"[NY state not city] Seeking advice on landlord issue with no lease on property and getting them into a lease. Property was renovated by the owners friend in exchange for part of the property and ended up getting caught owing money in other shit and got the property tied up in who owns it and owes what for her fuck ups

**This isn't the problem**... my family got the property from the family friend in the end with minimal monetary lose...during this time the friend had her family (to my knowledge) live in the house and without my family getting anything from it or any knowledge of who is living in the property. This is been last few years since it has been resolved but still no idea who is in the house...

What would the best plan for getting a hold of these people and seeing if they are paying anyone rent if so who... we don't mind having tenants and getting an income from the property but since no one in our family has seen the property since it was renovated years ago, we do not know the state of the property, if we are liable for any damage that may be there without even knowing about it.. should we go knocking? call cops to go knock? have a lawyer send them a contact?

So today, my girlfriend told me that they made all of the employees sign a statement of understanding that they will be fired if they discuss pay with one another going forward.

"Filed a Protective Order, Have Some Questions Hi everyone, from Indiana (US). Friday last week i filed a protective order for harrassment against a person with a record for things including invasion of privacy, domestic battery, etc. I consulted with a local police officer who walked me through what all I should need to get the order approved. I submitted the petition online through my county due to the current events. I called my county clerks office a couple days in because I saw no progress on it, and was worried I missed something. They approved it and it's still listed as ""Pending"" at the circuit court level. Im growing concerned and am worried this will be delayed indefinitely. The circuit court has a public number available, should I call and see if there's anything more I need to do? Sorry, I'm not used to having to do this sort of thing. Thanks."

"UPDATE: daughter tells me about inappropriate touching. What can I do legally to keep her safe? Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gdkxbk/daughter_tells_me_about_inappropriate_touching_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

We were able to get in today with the child advocacy center. First the team assigned to the case spoke with myself and her father. I explained why we were all here(bleeding, accidents, daughter (4) telling me her fathers roommate puts things in her butt). Father then says along the lines of “again this is a misunderstanding, I know what happened, he was telling her to pull her pants up so he put a marker in her butt crack.”

We are taken to lobby and social worker then takes daughter to interview her. While this is happening two social workers come to speak with us about a physical exam,they explain it’s a consent led exam and daughter is allowed to stop at any time . They leave I turn to father and tell him I think it’s a good idea to proceed. He gets very angry telling me I don’t get to make that decision and I’ll be hearing from his lawyer. I try to explain why I feel such way and he just kept saying it’s too much trauma and I don’t have the right to make the choice(legally I do). 

They finish interview with daughter and we(mom and dad) go back into meeting room with the team. The police officer assigned to the case explains that she didn’t say anything to the social worker that would cause them to believe anything happened and the case is officially closed. 

My lawyer is in mediation all day and will not be available to talk until tomorrow. 

So. Obviously I do NOT want any of this to be true or happening to my daughter, but am I crazy for finding it extremely inappropriate for a grown man to think sticking a marker in a toddlers butt crack is ok? Or that he was testing to see what he could get away with? I also just found out he has a degree in behavioral analysis.....which is more upsetting. Do I have any ground to stand on by requesting the removal of said roommate before visitation is allowed again?

I feel so lost.

"[OH] How do I explain this conviction on application for school license? I'm applying for a temporary license to work in a school district as a school psychologist and there is a criminal history part that asks: 

1. Have you ever been convicted of any criminal offense *(except misdemeanor traffic offenses)*?  
You **MUST** disclose:

* all criminal convictions
* misdemeanors and felonies
* guilty pleas
* convictions based on a plea of no contest or a plea of nolo contendere, including an Alford plea
* felony traffic offenses

and 

2. Have you ever had a criminal conviction or guilty plea sealed or expunged *(except misdemeanor traffic offenses)*?

&amp;#x200B;

In 2017 I was arrested  after sneaking into a community swimming pool. I was charged with criminal trespassing (4th degree misdemeanor) and also charged with assault which was unsubstantiated. My public defender told me I needed to plead guilty to both charges since they were from the same incident but the assault charge was dismissed in court and then I had it expunged. I was convicted of trespassing and after a year I had the charge expunged as well. 

My questions are: Should I answer yes to both questions or just the second? And - how should I go about explaining this in the ""explanation"" section?"
"[KY] Employer will be garnishing my wages after paying my payroll with a PPP loan So backstory of important information:

I am a dental professional that works on a percentage of collections (example: service costs $100. Insurance pays $70. My pay is $70 times my percentage because that is what is collected). However, when I started last June with this employer, I was on a daily base pay until December (For example, $100/day or percentage of collections. Whichever is greater). Then in January, it switched to only the percentage without the base pay. I’m a w2 employee and have Health benefits through my employer.

We have been off for a little over a month due to COVID-19, but are officially opening our doors on Monday after my employer got the PPP loan this week. They said we all must come back to work and off unemployment. Cool. Scary time to be in someone’s mouth, but people need dentistry so it is what it is.

I was informed by my employer today that since the loan was based on 2019 wages, I would be paid the greater of a base pay for the next 8 weeks or percentage of collections. That’s great news! My collections will be almost nonexistent the next 8 weeks due to no one wanting to come to the dentist. 

Then they hit me with the sketchy part:
If the pay over the next 8 weeks exceeds my collections, they plan to garnish my wages to recoup the excess. So say they pay me $10,000 in 8 weeks, but I only make $7,000 from collections (hopeful at this point).That means they will be garnishing in increments $3,000 from my pay check after the 8 weeks. Following the money, they get the PPP money and spend it on my payroll to get it forgiven, then garnish my wages to get back forgiven payroll money. Meanwhile I’m being pulled off unemployment, stuck with the risk of no collections and essentially a 0% payday advance loan. I’m the only non-hourly employee at the office, so I have no one to compare this to. Is this legal? I really feel like I’m getting the bad end of the stick here. Thanks for any insights.

"CSPA Age-Out Scenario with Coronavirus Hey,

Here from the Immigration subreddit since I've been given more context from my mom and seen paperwork and read into everything I can on the internet and PDFs. I'm like 17 and haven't taken AP Gov yet, I just realized how confusing all of this can be. Lawyers out there, I appreciate you.

My mom, a US Citizen at the time, applied for her sister (from **India ,F4**) , and thereby her sister's family (of 1 spouse, two children), given the priority date of late Jul. 2008. At the time the elder sister was almost 11 years old. The federal case-online site said it was received on Feb 2010. My mom's lawyer said hopefully they'll be okay, but my mom doesn't contact her much, so my cousin and I called each other last night and figured we could look into it ourselves.

It took two years for the petition to reach and be approved by the USGov, and as of now it still hasn't been approved.

My cousin, the elder sister, has been **aged out according to the CSPA age calculator**, she's 21 years old and had the 2 year wait period subtracted to be 19, but her case is predicted to be in done in September 2024, so she'd have no chance I think.

Question's I have from this scenario are

1. Is the CSPA age calculator judging the predicted date based on the current work period they have? (I think they did about 2 weeks of visas for F4, between the April and May bulletin?)
2. Will **Coronavirus** extend the processing times/priority dates/whatever it's called? And if they do, will this help to prevent her age out?
3. Processing times will surely speed up post-pandemic, correct?
4. Once she ages out, is it better for her to apply for- **a student visa** (she's going to graduate from college with a Bachelors at 23, could do Masters in the US and attempt to gain permanent residency from Greencard lottery from there. I worry about her showing something called **Intent-To-Stay?** Read about it while looking at student visas, but they said visas can be revoked if you try and permanently immigrate.)- **her mother/father to apply for her while she stays in India alone** (probably doing her Masters there while she waits- **her brother to apply** (which I don't think would be a good idea since F4 is least prioritized?)- **an employment visa** with her Bachelors's, somehow gaining permanent residency from that point?
5. Just a general question, but why does CSPA subtract the approval-waiting time, which in our case was 2 years, and not the waiting period for the interview (post approval, 8 years for us?). No one probably knows a reason but I was just surprised to see only 2 years get subtracted since we and many others have probably waited many, many years.

I'm so sorry for so many questions, I'm just trying to figure something out and have been all day, before she wakes up and reads all the articles and screenshots of charts and dates I've sent her. Thank you so much for your help, it's greatly appreciated! If there's any information you'd like me to add I definitely can."
"Auto Insurance Refusing to pay I was involved in a (seemingly) relatively minor accident some time ago. The drivers insurance approved and was paying everything. Then on the day of pickup, it was realized that the driver would be maxing out his policy (15k) once the rental costs had been added in. At that point they issued no more payments and the claim was passed over to my insurance who would be covering the balance (sans my deductible) and then pursuing the driver to recoup said deductible. After reviewing the paperwork my insurance decided they weren't going to pay for certain items totaling \~5500 (disputing that they were necessary, but were required to complete the repairs), and have seemingly finalized the claim.

The car is still at the repair shop, ready to go for the past week, and won't be released until the balance is paid. Do I pay the balance then pursue small-claims or wait and continue to pressure my insurance to pay the balance, minus the deductible? And this doesn't even include re-application of ceramic coating and PPF for the repaired part of the vehicle, or recouping diminished value.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Is the repair shop legally allowed to withhold my vehicle from me?

\- Is my insurance provider legally (contractually) required to pay this balance since it has previously been approved work?

\- What are my rights while the repair shop, dealership, and insurance provider battle it out?

"Juvenile Petit Larceny- was I ever charged? Throwaway, bear with me for my lack of info

I am in VA. When I (22) was 17 I was caught stealing about $100 worth of items from Kohl’s with a friend. She was brought to the station as she took a lot more than I did and to the best of my knowledge got fingerprinted. I was spoken to by police in an office in the Kohl’s and told to go home after speaking with officers. 

In response to this, I had to go to the court one afternoon with my mom and a bunch of others who did similar things and learn about shoplifting- basically a diversion course. I was informed that after this class, whatever was on my record would go away like nothing happened.

I have no knowledge at all about how this effects me now. I honestly don’t even know if I was ever “charged” or “arrested” or if this will ever pop up on a background check. I am currently trying to get my nursing license and did not disclose this because it was “thrown out”, but now I am worried. Should I be? I would really appreciate any assistance. Thanks!"

"[UT] No money for rent and roommate wants signature to get out of our lease Should it come to eviction what steps could I take to delay and/or defer my hearing in Utah long enough to keep me housed until 7/31?  Other than Coronavirus fallout is there anything else I claim to keep me from becoming homeless?

My roommate and I are two months into our year long lease, now they want out and have asked me to sign a 30 day notice to cancel our lease and pay $2000 to cover my half of rent for April, May, and lease cancel fee.  The other option would be to pay the entirety of the remainder of our lease $7000 which makes even less sense to me.  Should I sign what she's putting in front of me or decline since I can't pay it anyways?

I lost my job due to the Coronavirus back in March and haven't been able to secure a job, let alone earn anything.  I don't qualify for unemployment (moved to UT in Dec) and ineligible for the stimulus (parents claimed me for 2019 tax year).

"Are online sweepstakes illegal if I don't charge. So i got have a website made and ready to go up that I made myself.

A friend said this may be illegal I believe since they don't need to pay to enter its not a raffle and its not against any law.

"Can I include short quotes (less than 15 words) from authors &amp; business leaders in my eCommerce product (journal)?  

Hi LegalAdvice community,

Looking to include some quotes from authors and business leaders in my product (journal).

I've already done a bit of research, but the info I found are mostly around quoting movies/songs/anime on T-shirts &amp; mugs, hence I'd like to ask more specifically. (I'm based in Australia.)

I do plan to attribute the authors either way, but because I'm going to include at least 90-100 quotes (3,4 quotes from different authors), it could take me forever to go through the process asking for permission. I just want to ship an MVP by the end of this month, and start getting some income during this period. (No job at the moment.)

**Will I be at the risk of infringement if:**

* Half of the quotes in the journal are going to be my original thoughts, but the other half are from these authors and business leaders (as their quotes have had a positive impact on my life so I want to include them in my product).
* Each quote will be fewer than 15 words, mostly found from their email newsletters or noted down when from their podcasts. Some quotes will be from their books but are still fewer than 15 words. Does this mean the quote is too short to be protected by copyright and is open for public use?
* The quotes aren't in public domain. They're from people such as Seth Godin and Ryan Holiday who are still well and alive, or lesser-known leaders from the advertising industry who could be harder to contact.
* I'd also like to include some URLs to interesting YouTube videos (e.g. TED Talks, or insightful interviews). I've read it's okay but want to be sure.
* Yes, the journal is to sell as an eCommerce product, for profit.

**What I know so far:**

* ""Generally speaking, short phrases and titles cannot be copyrighted, especially if there is only a limited number of ways you could express the same idea/concept.""
* It's okay to quote a book title (not its content), a fact, or a very short phrase (but there's no specific details on the length).
* This is a copyright-related question, not trademark-related.
* I'm not quoting a song lyric, nor poem, which means less likely to have copyright issues. (Doesn't mean it's okay to use it though if it's not the right thing to do...)
* I'm not using more than a few sentences length from a book, so my quotes shouldn't impact the value of the original work. But for email newsletters and podcasts, I'm not sure?
* If anything, my journal is raising awareness towards the authors I admire, rather than plagiarising their work as I'm going to attribute them...?

Thanks!

PS. If this is a subject that's best consulting a copyright lawyer via a paid appointment, can anyone recommend one in Australia please (Brisbane)? Happy to pay as I respect one's profession and knowledge."
"Landlord keeps coming over without notice when no one is home and cutting down trees, bushes, etc. Says she is going to sell the house but won’t give us a timeline of when. I live in WA , my current lease states that my landlord has to give us notice of 24 hours before coming over to do repairs/work if non threatening condition. 
The past week she has been coming over when the household is at work and tearing up everything in the backyard. When we ask her about it she says she is going to sell the house but doesn’t know when. Obviously this freaks us all out because what are we to do if one day she just says the house is sold get out? And for now it’s the backyard but what happens when one day we get home from work and she was remodeling the bathroom or kitchen or something inside the home while we were gone and now the room is out of commission for a few days? 

So I guess my question is what do I do? Is there anything I can do? I’m scared of getting removed from my home without having time to get anything lined up, especially during this trying time."

"We are a (501-C3) Anime con that had to delay until 2021, a vendor is threatening suit over a refund that we cant give. Can anyone offer opinions? Advice? Hello r/LegalAdvice

We are a smaller anime convention located in Kentucky that gets about 4K\~ attendees per year, and are entirely run by volunteers.  From the board of directors, the president, all the way down to the volunteer who comes in for one day to monitor the viewing room, we are an entirely volunteer force.  Any profit from the year before us goes into paying off the rest of that year, and then pre-paying for as much as we can for the next year.  This includes the contract with our venue, programs, website upkeep, any little expense that goes into planning a medium-ish sized event.  One of the attractions at the event is our Exhibitor Hall, where attendees can go to buy art, figures, wall scrolls, and general nerdy memorabilia.   For this, I write the contract, outline the space, review portfolio submissions, vet outside vendors and companies for sponsorship, and run the annual charity auction.

Because of Covid-19 we have made a difficult decision to postpone our event until the summer of 2021.  This event was approved by our host city, and was made with the general safety of our crew and attendees in mind.  Con plague is real, if you ever go to one, wash your hands.  Anyways, I was sending emails to all of the artists and vendors who have registered for the 2020 year, paid their table fees (some have fees upwards of 2 grand USD) and letting them know our plan.  We have told them that any tables purchased for 2020 have automatically been locked in as approved and paid for when our event resumes.  Anyone who would like is welcome to privately sell their table to another vendor as long as we are able to get that vendors information.  A long time vendor emailed be back that this was not an acceptable response and hinted at taking ""legal action"" if we do not offer them a refund immediately.

Our contract for vendors specifically states in the Refund Policy that any refund cannot be given out until that years event has concluded.

I am not sure what the legal outcome of this possibly is. The convention plain and simple does not have the 2K odd dollars to issue this vendor a refund.  Its all tied up into other contracts, and none of the members of the staff are exactly able to shell one out since we are also tied up with Covid money problems, on top of the fact that most of us are college students doing this as a way to give back to our community.  The only other thing I could think of would be selling off convention assets, but most of the things we own (IE TVs and systems for the video game room, AV equipment, etc) are all personal items from the staff.  If we were brought to court, between lawyer fees and having to break contracts with the other facilities that we are tied to (that might also result in other fees for the convention) our event would likely cease to exist for forever, putting a lot of us in trouble financially.

Basically, what I am asking is that... is there a way for the vendor to actually sue us and win?  I would love to refund them if I could, they have been a business relationship with us for a long time (10+ years) but we simply dont have the money.  And if we issue them a refund, it creates a domino effect to the tune of about 20 grand.  I am not a lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, like, I have an art degree for goodness sakes. Any advice?  Opinions?  If it helps at all, we are a registered 501-C3 nonprofit organization with a contract with the vendors that says refunds cant be given until our event is over.  We havent ""cancelled"", just postponed. Please help."
"Abusive ex/bd, is it worth trying for child support? Any way to make sure my ex can't abuse my daughter? Shorter version:
ex raped, abused, manipulated me, damaged my property, stalked me, threatened to steal our daughter, gave away my dog, and is abusive to his little sister too, is irresponsible and reckless with our daughter when given the chance. Recently groped me after we broke up. I never reported him because I was dumb and cared too much. We have a 6 month old daughter together, and he's not on the birth certificate, my daughter has my last name, paternity hasn't been established but I know for a fact he's the dad. He helps with nothing other than 2 outfits, 3 boxes of diapers, and a cheap toy or two. Is it worth pursuing child support? Is there a way to keep him from my daughter or keep him from getting any sort of custodial rights? Is there a legal way I can keep him from visiting whatsoever? He's been visiting once or twice a month, for an hour or so. He has to be supervised by my family or he tries to be manipulative, make me cry, or get in my pants. He also is reckless with holding our daughter wrong 

&lt;This parts mainly for venting and more details&gt; long version: Soooo my dumb ass made the mistake of dating an abusive and very manipulative douche. This guy has beaten my dog (extra cruel bc he knew he was a rescue, my dog had been a bait dog prior to us having him) and gave him away to someone hours away, who then took him a few states over and abandoned him at a pound. My car was broken down at the time and I couldn't rescue my dog, and it still haunts me to not know what happened to him. He has been known to throw his little sister off him while yelling expletives like ""fuck off!"" While playing video games, he cracked my windshield punching it, would pick me up drunk from bars after we broke up to take advantage of me and then verbally abuse me and ditch me on the side of the road, miles from my car in winter at 2am without my phone or jacket, then come back acting nice to lure me back in after leaving me for 20 minutes or so, just to continue verbally abusing me. He would drive past my house multiple times a night every night most of one year and still occasionally did from time to time after he stopped doing it regularly. He also broke into my friend's house while we were broken up to ""make sure I wasn't having sex"" and followed me out to make sure I left, then followed my car no matter where I drove or how I tried to lose him. He lied to coworkers, friends, family, etc that I was cheating and abusive, so that they'd pity him and take his side when I broke up with him. everything was always my fault, he never could accept responsibility. He also used up all my money back in 2016. He used me to cheat on his new girlfriends. He got me pregnant and wanted to make things work and my dumb ass believed when he said he'd get better. He then cheated on me while I was pregnant, made threats to kidnap my kid, and then when he found out I wasn't going to put him on the birth certificate or give his last name, he broke up with me and left me for the other girl, a few days after birth. He didn't show up to the hospital until i was close to giving birth, and he came cross faded as hell, smelling like he had a sex marathon with the new girl. He even tried to bring her in to watch me give birth. This isn't everything he did, but point is he's a terrible abusive person, and I know he'd treat my daughter poorly if given the chance to be alone with her. He already let her head flop and dangle as a newborn, no matter how many times he was corrected by nurses even, he would torture my baby by waking her up the moment she fell asleep, over and over again, until she was screaming crying, just so he could take selfies with her, etc. I've seen how neglectful him and his parents were with his baby sister, so him dumping my baby on them, or them supervising is not much of an improvement."
"Does FIL have right to kick us out because he doesnt think we pay him rent So this is kind of a long story. My husband has lived with his parents all his life, some by choice and some because his father guilt him into staying to look after his sick mom. 5 yrs ago i met my husband and about 3.5 yrs ago i moved into with him and his parents. At the time his father wanted us to help fix up the farm and get it ready to sell and he would give my husband his inhertitance to start our life together.
Oh i should add before me and my husband met his father had made a ton of promises like you will get 1/3 of the equity in the house for maintaning it and or you can have the opportunity to buy the farm for whats owing on it when you get married. Those sorts of things. So for 20 plus yrs while living at the farm my husband never paid rent by money he paid it by his time 
Running the farm was and is a full time job in its self, plus he fixed all the cars and my husband even bought all the farm equipment needed to keep the farm up.
About a yr ago there was a blow up, this was about the same time me and my husband started a business and it meant being away from the farm for weeks on end. So my husband hasnt done as much around the farm but we also arent there much either. When home we buy everything including groceries and pay for our internet ect(his dad doesnt pay a penny for anything for us) During the huge blow up his father went back on all promises, he acused my husband of living rent free and taking advantage of the situation and told him he wont see a penny of the inheritance, instead it was going to all the other kids that left the family years ago(this was fine by us cause we never cared about the money other then my husband feels as tho he wasted his life away staying here this longand should be compensated for his time.)
So my question is, the FIL tried to kick us out today over something reallly stupid, and i basically said to him he cant kick us out, we havent done anything wrong, not to mention my husbands sick mother doesnt want us to leave and shes told us many times we dont have to pay any rent because we do so much around the farm.. Shes also on mortage and owns half the farm. BUT last yr the FIL had her sign power of attorney over to him and now FIL believes he can speak for her even if she says something he trumps her because in his words ""he has the power over her and she has no say"" 

We will be leaving soon anyways, we just gotta find the house we want. But my question is FIL says husband lived rent free yet in fact the time, furniture, equipment and materials that my husband bought would be way more then what $500 a month that FIL thinks he was scammed out of. Am i correct in thinking that?"
"Criminal Summons for failure to provide proof of a receipt for registration three years ago, even though it was done. Hello! 

I have a good friend who was pulled over for expired tags in 2017. The officer gave him a citation, my friend renewed his registration and took the receipt to the county clerk and they waived the ticket.

Today he was driving with his girlfriend in her car, and an officer started following them. After a few minutes he turned on his lights and they pulled over. The officer said he had looked up her plates, and even though her tags were current, that they had been canceled and she would need to go to the clerk and fix it. He then took my friends license and registration as well. 

When the officer came back, he had a criminal summons stating my friend had been given a citation in 2017 for expired tags and never followed up. My friend remembered when it had happened and knows he then renewed his registration and took the receipt to the clerk to have them waive the ticket.

He has a court date now. How does he prove that he updated his registration three years ago and corrected the problem? He doesn’t have the registration receipt, because he’s updated it every year since then. 

Would it not be in their system that he corrected the issue? Does he need a lawyer for this court date? How does he go about proving he paid his dues three years ago?

All of this happened in Kentucky."
Can an NDA still be enforcement after the business entity has changed? A couple years ago I converted my business from an LLC to a C-Corp. The business name changed slightly (removed the word “brand”). Can all of my old NDA’s executed under the LLC be enforced by the new C-Corp? I since closed the LLC after opening the Delaware C-Corp.
"Can you sell a deceased parent's car without (unintentionally) taking responsibility for their debts? North Carolina. My(27F) dad died in March 2019, leaving behind a 1987 run-down Mercedes (probably worth less than 1k) and 16k of hospital bills racked up within the last 3 months of his life. He had no other property or assets, and no will.

He left his car on my mom's property (they were divorced but living together) and I'm shipping out to join the Army in August. I'm trying to figure out what I can do to sell or get rid of his car before I leave since we believe only a relative can transfer a deceased person's car into their own name. Meaning my mom won't be able to do anything with it once I leave since they haven't been married for over 20 years.

We left his estate alone, along with all of the bills that are in his name. My mom's coworkers (at the local courthouse) said that ignoring his estate is the only way to make sure his debts don't transfer to us. The lawyers who shared this information don't have any other advice for us except to ignore his bills. But it's been over a year now and it seems his debt is still active. We've been waiting for someone to either come claim his car or clear his estate. We were told that after a few months with no executor, the court will appoint one. But it doesn't really seem like anything has happened.

If I transfer my dad's car into my name (to sell it) will I become responsible for his debt too? 

TL;DR After a year with no executor to the estate, how can we get rid of the car without claiming responsibly for his estate?"
"Friend experiencing severe child abuse, how can he get somewhere safe? TW: mentions of abuse

&amp;#x200B;

I have a close (16M) transgender friend who is experiencing child abuse at home. Since 7th grade, he has been constantly physically and emotionally abused. Beyond being hit by both his mom and stepdad, he has had food, clothing, and medications withheld from him, as well as transportation to prescribed  therapy sessions. 

He has a close family friend who is prepared to take him in, but his mom is not willing to allow him to leave. Is there any way he could get out of the situation with at least some certainty of ending up in a healthy and safe environment?"
"Car company. (Texas, USA) My parents recently bought me a car as a graduation. In the process of buying the car they told us that by giving $3,500 of down payment we have 3 years worth of mechanical issues fixed at no costs with them. Now a week after having the car, we noticed that the car started to have braking issues. We tried to call them for over a span of 5 days.. At last we finally got in contact with them and set an appointment. We took the car in and told us we were having the brakes and sensors replaced. When we got the car back not only did it come back with now an issue light, but an issues oxidation with brake pads. Now the thing is that they ONLY replaced one brake pad, not 4 but 3. Okay thats fine, but not only did they not replace the brake pads, with the small computer for the car, they  just erased the warning light on my dash board while the car is doing the exact same problem!!! My stepdad says that this obviously can be a safety issue not only for me but for those around me.. Is this something I can fight with a lawyer or something to work out with, with the dealer its self?"

"Immigration &amp; Divorce (Texas/Mexico) To make it short,

I married an illegal alien from Mexico a few years ago. After we got married, we filed to fix his legal status. Everything was going fine until he had to leave the country for an interview for his visa. His visa was denied and we had to file another form. During this time, our marriage was horrible. His abuse escalated and he began having affairs. Eventually, I broke down and walked away from our marriage. We never filled that form and we haven't filed for divorce yet. I also later found out, I do not have evidence of this, that his mom and him were using me for him to get citizenship. 

My questions are:

Does this change how I should proceed with my divorce? And if this will affect me later on if I ever have to go through that process with immigration again?

"College changed my funding plan after I graduated. Threatening collections on me. I graduated with my MS in finance in December 2018.  My classes were billed quarterly, typically three at a time. Up until my last 2 classes, I had no issues with the financial aid department. I took once class at a time, each lasting 5 weeks.

I have a signed funding document from August 2018 showing the costs for my last two classes. I completed both classes and graduated in Dec 2018. In Feb, 2019 while waiting for my diploma, I get an email from the college saying I owe them, not Dept of Ed, $6k because they billed my funding plan incorrectly. Additionally, since I already graduated they can’t go back and change anything.

They have held my diploma and transcripts and are not threatening collections. I told them to kick rocks because you can’t just change my tuition after I graduate and expect me to foot the bill.

They are uncooperative and not budging at all.

"Trying to submit an application for FAFSA, but parent is refusing to assist due to failure in filing their taxes. Living in Michigan, I have 3 years of undergraduate college towards a bachelors degree completed. I have had to take time off, but am now working on going back at least part time.

I have been attempting to complete my FAFSA application since November 2019, but my parent is passively refusing to help me. They have not filed their 2018 or 2019 taxes, and I am a dependent student (in the eyes of student aid) regardless of filing my 2019 taxes as not being able to be claimed. Since I am a dependent student, I need their 2018 tax information to submit my application. I originally talked to my parent about them not claiming me as a dependent because I received advice else where that it may benefit me when applying for financial aid, but like I said, I am still a dependent student. 

This is getting ridiculous and I don’t know if I have other options such as contacting FAFSA for assistance or some sort of exception. I’m not sure whether I have any reason to believe there’s a fraudulent reason for my parent’s failure to file their taxes.

"Company is refusing to honor their warranty after I cut my finger following phone techs instructions. Hello,

Feb 16th I called COMPANY tech support because my laptop would not power on. The rep walked me through taking off the back plate and disconnecting the battery. While doing so, I cut my finger on the battery connector and bled around the connector. I told this to the woman and she apologized and told me she would escalate the repair and have a technician come repair it.

Days went by and the woman asks for pictures of the blood and cut finger. These were sent. Many go by and I have no answer on the warranty. I call and I’m told I will need to send a photo of the service tag and some information. Unfortunately by this time I have begun my move to another state and leave the $3000 paper weight behind. My previous boss and family friend takes the proof photo(as if the bloody one and finger weren’t enough) and sends it to them. They do not check the email and close the case while I was too busy setting up in my new home and dealing with a global pandemic. They emailed stating it was “archived”. 

Less than a month goes by and I am forced to restart the process. By this time it has been been months (April 27th) and I’m told to talk to a lawyer. I was planning on hiring one at the start of may but I thought something was finally going to happen. Eventually a week goes by and no word from COMPANY. They have closed the case and stated “inconsistency in the photos provided”. The photos are of the same laptop. They recommend I contact the legal department and continue the process with the lawyer I assumed I would need to get.

The laptop is worth south of $3000. And is really an important investment in my new business. I’m saving to get a new one but cannot continue my work until I do.

I did get theatric in my plea with many agents during my many calls to Company. However I feel justified considering the time crunch during which the claim occurred and the fact that the laptop wasn’t working before the blood was spilled. I said “well I might as well have aids” to the phone rep in an sarcastic manner considering how they were treating it as a biohazard. One other rep told me I was lying to Company because I said my laptop would be delivered in NEW STATE after I moved, however because of the virus I had to cancel those plans over fear of transmission to me or my RELATIVE who would be shipping the device but currently is undergoing chemo and shouldn’t expose herself.

I do believe I let my temper get the best of my after month two and I had to apologize for raising my voice over the phone, though I never insulted anyone nor talked poorly about the product. The laptop was covered under warranty and it took COMPANY months to give me an answer. I also injured myself while following instructions from a phone rep.

What is my course of action. I am willing to drop it and go save for something else if there is a chance a suit or arbitration will cost me anything."

"Signed new lease for condo, building caught fire, then flooded Hi Everyone, thanks in advance for any advice that can be provided. Looking for some guidance and see what types of recourse I have available.

I am in Alameda county, California, USA.

My friend and I signed a new lease at a condo a few days ago.

A few days later, our building caught fire (neighboring unit at fault), then the hallway flooded, leading to a large chunk of our floor of the building flooding. I should add that we are on the 3rd floor of a 3 story building. The water ended up flooding our dwelling, we have laminate/hardwood and carpeting, which were ruined.

None of us were harmed and none of our possessions were permanently damaged fortunately, but the dwelling is uninhabitable currently due to the water/fire damage and soot. Due to Covid, I was already working remote from a relative's house so I wasn't present when this incident occurred. My roommate is staying with some friends for the moment after the incident happened

We got some basics out of the way with our landlord, as we are not at fault in any way, and since this happened at the beginning of the month, they offered not to charge rent, and it will not affect our deposit. However, the place is uninhabitable, it reeks of smoke/soot smell, and the carpet is ruined. The cleaning up crew that came by also reported that while we can come/go as needed, we cannot stay there either until it is livable again, my understanding is that they will fix up the main section, uncertain for our dwelling though.

We were also informed that they are waiting on the insurance/adjuster folks to make their report on the incident as far as damages and reimbursement is concerned for the building.

Our landlord was saying that if the place can't be fixed quickly, there was talk of breaking our lease so we can move elsewhere. The problem is, we would prefer NOT to move if possible as the location is otherwise solid for us, and we have a good relationship with the landlord.

We do not have any sort of renters insurance on our end either. I believe the landlord/building management both have the respective types of insurance for the building and individual condo however.

Apologies if I missed any details that might be important.

My questions are:

* Can our landlord just break our lease like that? 
* Do we have any recourse requiring them to find temporary housing in the meantime or anything of that nature?
* What sort of tenant rights are available to us, or rather, where can we look further into these?
* Obviously moving while stay-at-home order is in effect adds another layer of complexity to the issue, as a result of it, are there any further protections as a result of it?"
"Best way to unwanted return mail? I have an ex-roommate that moved out on not so great terms. She hasn’t re-routed all of her mail from our current address. Is the best thing to do just slap a “RTS” on the mail and put it back into the mailbox? The leasing office doesn’t like to reroute any mail and some of them actively sigh if we try to bring it over to them. 

She actually moved to another apartment in the same complex and we know where she parks her car. Are we able to throw it on her car windshield for her to find or could that open us up to liability issues with her mail? It’s unopened and untouched and starting to pile up.

"[Florida] Daughter's Responsibility with Respect to Debt of Deceased Parent My partner's grandmother died with an estate that had basically no value - she had a house worth like 140k and owed like 125k (possibly more) on it and she had a car that had more debt on it than it was worth and an account with like $800. There was no will. My partner's mother would be the intestate heir (since her mother's husband is dead). Given that, after the fees and costs of administering an estate, there would be basically nothing left in the estate, my partner's mother decided to not pursue any proceeds of the estate. She just wants to allow the mortgagee to foreclose on the house and allow the car lender to foreclose on the car. 

But she wants to confirm if she has any obligations with respect to facilitating these foreclosures (or if she can just do literally nothing and let the lenders effect them) and also to make sure that she won't somehow acquire any obligations with respect to these debts of her mother. Already the car lender has been sending letters that imply that she might have to pay for the costs of repossession.

IAAL (is that an abbreviation?) but this isn't my area. I believe that my partner's mother is not responsible for the debts of her mother so long as she didn't guarantee or cosign (she didn't). I do worry that it might be possible for her to become responsible by assuming them either through statements she makes or by actions she takes. She feels like she has to help these lenders but I am of the opinion that it might protect her more to do  nothing because so long as she does nothing she won't take any actions that could be construed as assuming the debt."
Second warning of lease violation This is about my neighbor who lives in the same building as me.

"Is this App Concept Legal? Hello. Based in WA, USA.


A social crossword puzzle app in which you can invite friends to do crosswords alongside you. The catch is rather than having a library of public crosswords, you import them by taking an image of a crossword with your camera. The imported puzzle is only shared with you and a small handful of friends you invite, not publicly available. Could this lead to legal action by any crossword producing companies? My inclination is that I would be no more responsible legally than google would be if I created a spreadsheet on google sheets and entered the NYT crossword to share and work on with friends there.

"University Charging Full Tuition During Pandemic. I'm in a graduate program that is still charging us the full tuition regardless of our current state of online learning. The program is in the medical field and the students were set to graduate, meeting clinic rotation hours, by late summer. At this time, our rotations have been cancelled without a return date and we are now doing online learning which is not meeting the standards. We don't have clear guidelines from our regulating body so even if we spend hours on the assignments online, none of it would qualify to meet the graduation requirements. I saw John Oliver's report past Sunday which stated that some students in NY are filing a class action law suit against the schools to reduce the tuition accordingly. 

What is a class action law suit? Does our situation qualify for us to file one? How does one go about filing one?"

"Need help with info concerning Wage Theft I work on an ambulance in Georgia. Around October or so of 2019 my partner and I had a particularly busy day where we ended up running 16 calls. All of them were ALS and so my poor paramedic had to tech every one. On the day in question, we had low ambulance levels the whole day, and never stopped running  and therefore didn't have a chance to complete any one of our Patient Care Reports before the day was done.  (PCR's). Now we have a policy that states that all PCR's must be completed within an hour of the call if at all possible, but they must be completed before you leave to go home with no exceptions. This means my partner had to stay after his shift was supposed to end and fill out all the PCR's that he didn't have the time to during the day. Because of the chaos of the day, it was exceedingly difficult to match the correct patient information to each call since hours had passed since we had run them. He ended up staying there for the next 6 hours filling out these PCR's to completion in order to comply with policy.

He remained clocked in during this time and racked up a whopping 6 hours of overtime in one night.

But then he was later brought in to a meeting with the higher ups who questioned him about the overtime. He told them the story, but when they heard it, they just told him that they believed he could have gotten it done faster and shouldn't have had to work so much overtime. They then refused to pay him for 6 hours of overtime. They said they would only pay him 2 hours OT, and asked him to sign a document of unknown purpose. He asked to have a statement outlining this refusal of pay printed off for him including the reason for the action. They refused saying that such information was strictly proprietary. (Obvious horse shit)

I tried to convince him to speak to a lawyer about this, but he doesn't believe he has a case.

Being that it is only a single instance of wage theft, I don't know if it is worth going after them. Does anyone know of what kind of total compensation a case like this might bring? Or is there more information that is needed to take a guess at that?"

"Have to pay carpet cleaning charges for move out? I lived in an apartment in Texas that is owned by a company that has properties across the state. My roommate and myself recently moved out of our old place. They told us we have to pay for professional carpet cleaning so they can get the place ready for new tenants. However, according to the lease ""**38. Cleaning.** You must thoroughly clean the apartment, including doors, windows, furniture, bathrooms, kitchen appliances, patios, balconies, garages, carports, and storage rooms. You must follow move-out cleaning instructions if they have been provided. If you don’t clean adequately, you’ll be liable for reasonable cleaning charges—including charges for cleaning carpets, draperies, furniture, walls, etc. **that are soiled beyond normal wear (that is, wear or soiling that occurs without negligence, carelessness, accident, or abuse).**"" 

According to the move out instructions, ""Vacuum all carpet and remove all stains. It’s recommended that you leave the shampooing and cleaning to our professional. However if you choose to have your carpets professionally shampooed it must be by a truck mounted machine and you must submit the receipt as proof so this cost is not deducted from your deposit or charged. Keep in mind if stains are still visible charge will be assessed accordingly.""

We vacuumed and spot cleaned all small stains to the point where they were gone, there is nothing there that is considered beyond normal wear and tear and the assistant manger did acknowledge that in the walk through. 

We do not have any major stains, tears, or anything of that matter. When we did the walk through, we asked if professional would be added to our bill because there was only normal wear and tear and she said ""Either way you will still have to pay for them"" Even though it says otherwise in the lease, do we have to pay for professional cleaning ?"
"Apple is giving me the runaround after an error on their end, and I don't know what to do I am located in Alberta, Canada

Bear with me here, I guess this is mostly a rant but I would like some help, if anyone knows what to do.

On April 20th, I ordered an iPad Pro 12.9” and Apple Pencil. I paid for expedited shipping and was told 3 to 5 business days for my delivery, but didn’t receive it for 10 business days. Now during all this COVID confusion, I understand that it took more time. I requested a refund on my $15 shipping charge due to the delay, which they accommodated.

I checked my account, and received the credit back for the shipping, but also received the full amount for the iPad as well. I called Apple yesterday and spent over an hour on the phone with them trying to figure out what happened. It appears that the person I spoke to about the shipping filed a shipping investigation in error, even though I did tell them that I received my iPad. 

The “supervisor” I spoke to yesterday told me that they understood that this was Apples error and made arrangements to charge me for the iPad a second time, to fix the money I was refunded in error. She identified herself as a supervisor multiple times. I told her that I would need a specific timeframe for the charge, as it would exceed the limit I have in place for online purchases. She assured me that it would be done by midnight, so I called my bank and cleared the limit until midnight yesterday. She also told me she would be sending me AirPod Pros and a gift card for the amount of time I had spent up until that point dealing with this, which I appreciated.

Today, someone from their billing department called me and told me they didn’t get to it yesterday and would try again either today, or within the next couple of days. I’m very uncomfortable with clearing my limit for any longer than a few hours as I’ve had my bank account compromised before, and also told them the name and email of the person I spoke to about my payment arrangement for the previous day. They had no record I spoke to anyone, and no notes on my account about the promises she had made me.

At this point I have no idea what to do. I contacted apple myself about their error, I made the arrangements I had to make, and I was promised compensation for the issues I’ve had. The manager I spoke to today was very short with me, and repeatedly stated that it sounded like I was refusing to pay for the iPad. I already paid for the iPad.

"[Chicago/Illinois] Tenant Wants to End Lease On Lease End Date Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a college student holding a lease that began on 6/1 and is ending on 5/31. Given the uncertainty around COVID I'm considering not renewing my lease. My understand is that my lease agreement is fixed term so I wouldn't necessarily have to provide notice (more of a courtesy thing). However, I noticed this in the fine print of my agreement. 

  *60 Days' Notice. Tenant shall provide Landlord with written notice at least 60 days prior to the expiration of this lease in the event that tenant does not intend to renew for an additional term. In the event that Tenant fails to provide notice to Landlord as set forth herein, Tenant shall be considered a holdover tenant and, at Landlord's option, eviction proceedings may be commenced in accordance with the law* 

&amp;#x200B;

If someone is familiar with landlord-tenant law and could help me demystify all of this that would be much appreciated. For reference, when I don't renew I don't plan to live there at all (not sure if the holdover applies to me)."
"Unpaid tolls; firm taking me to court Hello all... I live in Colorado. I had a car that was registered to an old address of my parents' that had since been forwarded to where my mom lived. I believe she assumed I already paid them and never mentioned them.

I would just like to know what I need to do (get representation, etc.) as I have never been in a situation like this, and have nothing to prove payment toward any of the charges or anything like that."

"My wife was denied a job and a promotion because of her modeling My wife was really getting interested in modeling. To the point where she was actually starting to make money off of it. Classy stuff like runway modeling. Nothing nude or sexual. Some bikini stuff but nothing crazy. 

Anyway, some cow at her office complained. Probably jealous. Her work said it was fine but demanded she disassociate with work on social media. Which she did. She made a stage name for her modeling social media posts. Life went on. 

Then a job opened up that she was interested in. They blatantly told her she wouldn’t get it because of her modeling. She was also denied a promotion. They said she would never get the promotion unless she gave up modeling entirely. 

Meanwhile some of the girls she works with have very promiscuous pictures on their Facebook. I think she is being discriminated against because she’s pretty. Her job is very predominantly female. And very predominantly heavy females. 

What do you think?"
"Car tire of personal vehicle was slashed while running an errand for the business I work for a hotel in California.

I got out of the car and checked the tire. There were 3 slash marks. When I returned to the driver seat, the bag of cash was gone. This whole situation was caught on camera.

This happened while I was clocked in.

Two of my coworkers are having covid symptoms. 5 workers at the local Mexican market where they buy their groceries have tested positive so they think that’s where they got it. The owner of our restaurant has been mocking people for wearing masks at work and told these people that they need to come to work unless they can get tested and “prove” that they have it. We are only open for take out now but they are hoping to reopen for dine in as soon as they possibly can, they are hoping they for the 22nd.

"[RI] Ex broke up with me and took his name off the lease but some of his things are still here. Can I get him to pay some of the rent or am I SOL? My ex broke up with me at the end of April and has been staying with his mother since then. All this week he's been coming and going gathering some of his stuff, sometimes showing up without telling me. He took his name off the lease, thinking he won't have to pay rent for May. I'm planning on staying in the apartment and looking for a roommate because I can't afford it on my own. Is there any way I can get him to give me at least some money? He legally doesn't live here anymore but he's basically using the apartment as a storage locker.

He is also planning on taking the sofa even though he doesn't need it because he's moving in with his mother. Honestly, I think he's doing that to be a dick. He bought the sofa when we moved in. Can I use that as leverage for the rent or do I have to give it back?"

"PPP, employee rights My work has received the PPP. When they originally asked me if I wanted to be rehired, they said I would be paid a similar check as to what I was receiving prior to COVID-19. Also- being on unemployment, I couldn't refuse without losing my benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I agreed to return to work,  my employers then told me they could only pay me for a portion of my previous hours. I wrote them an email stating that I believed that to be incorrect, as they could pay me what I was receiving prior to COVID-19.

Now they are giving me two options: Take 13.5 hours of pay when I was previously scheduled for 30, or Take the 30 hours per week but do a ton of extra work for them that is not in my contract.

Isn't the PPP supposed to keep people OFF unemployment- they wrote that their CPA told them they only have to pay me for the hours I'm actually working- 13.5. With only 13.5 hours of pay- I would still need to be on unemployment- however, most likely wouldn't receive unemployment to make up for the additional hours.

\*This is because I recently moved across the country for this job this past Winter, and was only receiving $100/ week in unemployment due to recently graduating and moving to a new state .. and unemployment was based on what I was making November 2019-December 2019. 

Several other employees at the business are getting paid while having no other work to do at home. They have been trying to get me to quit in order to avoid paying unemployment insurance- as they have a high turnaround and have laid off several people in the last few years.

Any advice is much appreciated! Its hard to find information about the PPP that isn't specifically just about what qualifies a small business to receive the loan. What are the rules about how and when its supposed to be used to pay employees? Do employees HAVE to be actually working for the exact amount of hours in order to be compensated? Is it different for each state? I am located in Colorado.

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO-can they lay me off after the 8 weeks under the PP? Their business is failing and they will most likely need to,

I also read somewhere they had to pay employees within 10 days of receiving the loan, which so far has not been true for me."

My friend says she’s noticed bruising on her niece’s body and fears that the dad is abusing her.

"[CO] Lease terminated due to apartment building fire. Landlord is not allowing us to return to get our possessions and is refusing to return deposits until we have moved out Hi everyone. 

So early last week, my apartment building caught fire in the maintenance area which caused all residents to evacuate. Last Friday the landlord sent a letter to all residents saying that the damage is extensive and they are terminating everyone's lease. The letter also said that our deposits would be returned when we moved out (Remove our things from the apartment). It has since been a week, and they gave given us no information on when we will be able to get our things, mentioning that they need to have safety evaluations done and temporary lighting needs to be set up and they haven't been able to do either yet due to COVID-19. 

I understand the need for safety, but this means that the property management company is retaining our deposits while  dozens of families are now homeless. Is there anything we can do on our end? Thank you"
"Dog bit delivery man -- what to expect? Good afternoon,

Going to preface this with a TL;DR -- Our dog bit a delivery driver's finger. Why is the cost of an average dog bite so high, and what should I expect to pay in terms of damages? Should we communicate with the risk management company?

Long story:

My dog is incredibly protective since we moved to our new apartment, so we have been being extra cautious. We opt for contactless delivery in every case, and we wait several minutes after their call to get the food -- so our dog doesn't associate someone approaching the new door with a stranger. Unfortunately, our delivery driver forgot an item, and returned to place it as the door was opened. With the driver's hand being directly in front of our dog's face, he bit the driver's finger and ran away.

I mostly needed to preface that to assuage my shame, as it pains me to come across as an irresponsible dog co-parent, and if I didn't provide detail, I probably wouldn't have been able to post this at all.

I immediately crated the dog and helped administer first aid. The driver was shaken, so I helped him calm down, cleaned his wound, and helped him bandage it. I ensured he had my contact information, I offered the information on our dog's shots (which are kept up-to-date), and I contacted our county's animal control to report the bite.

When I spoke with my renter's insurance, I discovered that our policy does not cover animal bites. So, at this point, I am concerned because the average price for a dog bite (according to a google search) is in the tens of thousands of dollars. I expected to cover the price of a finger wound, so my first question is: Why are dog bites so expensive?

My second question is: What happens in the case where the risk management company for the delivery driver demands that I pay tens of thousands of dollars that I simply do not have? For some reason, I doubt that ""reasonable monthly payments"" is in the realm of possibility. Technically, his owner is unemployed due to the coronavirus.

Finally, should I communicate with the risk management company? As I might have expected, they have been aggressive and threatening throughout the encounter. They called my partner's phone, refused to identify themselves, and demanded to speak with me -- threatening my partner with court when he refused to hand the phone over when they wouldn't identify themselves. (I only identified them by searching the phone number on google after the fact. I am assuming they got the phone number from the delivery app.). Other than the phone call, they have sent a letter seeking ""reimbursement for the cost of the medical treatment and expenses associated with this incident."" Should I communicate and cooperate with them, or what is your advice?

I apologize that this post ran long -- I am not sure what information is relevant, and which information is not. I sincerely appreciate any assistance.

\[Edit\]: I realized that I forgot. Florida is my state, if it makes a difference! "
"[CA] Trying to locate a Last Will and Testament from a death in 1995. Can't find it filed as probate. In May of 1995, my mother passed away in Orange County, California. I'm finding conflicting information about probate laws during that time. Some sources say probate is required for assets to be transferred, and some sources say assets under $150k don't need to go to probate. I could use some help.

I searched the Orange County probate court database for a case number and couldn't find anything. I even paid for a specific name search and nothing came up. Then I went to the LA County probate court website and searched there, as that was the county my mother was born in. Nothing there, either.

What are my options at this point? I had a trust fund, which my father squirreled away, but I have no knowledge of how much was in the trust fund. I know that it was variable; my dad would tell me about the amount fluctuating ""with the stocks"" but that was all the information he ever gave me. By the time I was 18, the money was gone. I was told that since I was a minor, and my father was executor of the trust fund and the estate, he had the power to do with the money what he wanted? Even then, It's now 25 years later and I doubt I'm within the statute of limitations to recoup anything on that front.

I just want my mom's belongings. I want to see her will with my own eyes. And if I'm going to go after my dad for my mom's stuff, I want all the knowledge and power in my hands. Thanks so much for all your help. Current location is still California, as well."
"Asset disbursement after marital abandonment Ok so this is a weird situation and I’m real curious what the legal take on it is. 


Location info:
Married in California 
Mom lives in California 
Technical spouse moved to and ended up dying in Arizona. 


My mom is/was married to this guy since like 1996 or 1997. He left in 2004 but no legal separation or divorce was ever finalized. My mom had him served with divorce papers I don’t even know how many years ago. Considering how much debt he left in both their names I thought she was fair only asking for the house which she had been paying on since 2004 when he left. The papers never got signed and the divorce never got finalized. So in 2020 they’re still technically married. We found out recently that he died. Supposedly he has a will. My mom directed his sister to send it to her attorney since she’s worried his family is going to try to take the house she’s been paying for for the last 20 years. Even before he left she paid 2/3 of the house payment. His name is still on the deed, the house isn’t paid off. 


My questions are since they’re still technically married is my mom entitled to any of his assets? If he named anyone in his will to get a share of the house is that enforceable? Is his will even valid since they’re still married?"
"[WA] Served a Temporary Restraining Order from King County (Seattle-ish Area) - I Live in Texas Hi all,

Thank you for reading. I want to say I \*\*have contacted\*\* a Washington-based lawyer and have a consultation Monday. I am here to ask for your experience on this.

TL;DR: I received a TRO from my aunt alleging domestic violence (fear of bodily harm - NO physical violence has EVER occurred). I HAVE NOT contacted this person, I DO NOT want to contact this person, I WILL NOT contact this person - I AM FOLLOWING TO A ""T"" the directive to not contact this person. I DON'T WANT to go Washington or come within 1000 miles of it. I HAVE CANCER - I can't travel to contest this. I CAN'T afford to fight this.

What are the repercussions of having a restraining order against me (employment )? 

end TL;DR

I was served a temporary restraining order alleging domestic violence (fear of bodily harm - NO physical violence has EVER occurred). I am a pacifist in the strictest sense. I have ZERO desire to talk to/contact/ be anywhere near the person. I have blocked this person's number and blocked them on all forms of social media.

Can this affect my ability for employment? I am on disability for cancer until November and intend to go back to work immediately after. Will background checks reveal this restraining order and its contents? 

That is \*\*ALL\*\* I care about. If I was told ""as long as you follow the order, there are no further repercussions"" - I would not waste a second more thinking about this.

It does not matter, but the contents are untrue. I am reading some of the most perverse, dishonest accusations I have ever read. But I don't have the resources to fight this. This person is a multi-millionaire and I am drowning in medical debt."
"Family land dispute. One family member has refused to contribute payments. So I have some land in my family that is split between 4 of us.  It was previously our grandfathers and is split equally 25% each.  One of the family members has not contributed a single dollar in the last 20 years, paid no taxes, no Bill's etc.  Every year the taxes, water, electric, and another expenses has been split evenly by the remaining 3 of us.(including a couple vehicles that live at the land)

I am looking to move to the land and build a house on the property.  We are trying to find a way to split it up evenly.  

However this 4th person who has not paid is throwing a wrench into the situation.  What if any rights do they have to their share of the property?  They are over $20,000 owed in back taxes and Bill's.  Which is about equal to what their 25% share would come to.  

Should we be splitting the property 3 ways and just leave the 4th out?  Or are we legally obligated to let them have a say?  Thanks.

"Last Will while going through a divorce Hello! I live in Ohio. I separated from my husband back in February of this year.

I mentioned this to my family and they encouraged me to look into the Fair Labor Standards Act, and I’m wondering if this is in violation of any of their laws, as there was no change in the amount of time worked, or location as I was on site.

"[PA] Breaking lease during covid Hello everyone. Currently there are laws preventing eviction while this pandemic is ongoing, however, is there anything enacted for breaking a lease with no ramifications? Due to the virus both my gf and I (we both signed the lease) lost our jobs. We are running low on money and think it would be best to move in with our parents in the mean time to save up. However, we currently have a 13 month lease for our apartment that isn't up until next year. While we cannot be evicted, our landlord still wants us to pay rent continually. We aren't really happy with our living arrangements currently so if we could get out we'd be happier. We have a few months left but are wondering if there's anything in place due to the virus that would help us not be negatively affected for when we recover and continue renting.

I should mention that we haven't spoken to our landlord yet to see if they would be willing to allow us to break the lease, and this is an option we will try, but I figured I'd ask here in the meantime. I'm not sure if they'd do this however, as this is a pretty large rental company and not private so I feel my chances are slim. Thanks everyone."
Help I rented a new house with my boyfriend ( now ex) and my 3 children in March. He has been steadily breaking my things and stealing money from myself and my children. This week he tried to get physical when confronted about destroying my property. Myself and my children left due to me not wanting to get physical or having the police involved.

I've spoken to the landlord about his behavior and she said I can continue to live there. How can I get him out quickly before he destroys anything else? He's acting extremely out of character like hes on drugs or something.

"Insurance Company refusing to pay bills I was rear ended by a driver two and a half years ago.  I went to the hospital that afternoon after experiencing neck pain, and and a few times the following months.  After things did not get better after the first few visits, I was recommended to go to PT which I did.  The insurance adjuster originally told me to send her all the bills and she would cover them.  That soon changed though, and things became more difficult. I did consult with a lawyer who agreed to take my case but warned me this could be a three year ordeal.  This whole thing was already causing a great deal on anxiety and I decided not to go ahead with that, and figured I could just settle on my own for the bills plus a little pain and suffering.  Well fast forward once I am relatively recovered, I gather up all the bills and evidence and send it over.  In total about 5K in bills.  She offers 1000 plus 200 for pain and suffering, not even paying for all the doctors visits and none of the PT.  Her claim is that the PT is not related because I began it to long after the accident, despite the fact that I have the doctors recommendation which cites the accident as the reason for getting PT.  What are my options here?  I doubt a lawyer will take my case at this point, and she is not budging.  Should I try to get a note from my doctor that explains that the PT was 100% the result of the car crash?  Should I try and find a lawyer who would put some pressure on them?  I didnt think it would be this hard to get a reasonable offer.  I appreciate any and all advice, and I live in CO if that matters."
"Ex-Roommate Bringing Me to Small Claims Court About a year ago I signed a lease with three of my best friends from high school for an apartment in Georgia.

The lease agreement was from the first of May to the end of April, however me and another roommate (Roommate A) weren't able to live at the house from May-July. We discussed this with our other roommates, we all came to an agreement that me and Roommate A wouldn't have to pay for utilities for those three months since we weren't living there and didn't have any of our stuff there. We had first agreed upon this face to face and then further discussed and finalized the agreement through text. 11 months later, me, Roommate A, and another roommate (Roommate B) are moving out because of the terrible living conditions that our final roommate (Roommate C) had created (trash everywhere, constant screaming and fighting with his girlfriend, etc.). However, Roommate C wants to bring me and Roomate A to small claims court because we didn't pay for three months of utilities (even though he agreed we didn't have to during summer).

The estate is rather small, around $5000. The house has been taken back by the bank, which is what we all wanted. All items were distributed to everyone before I became executor.

There are two accounts that I believe are still active (a credit union account and a stock share). I know I need to show them the death certificate to show he died. Q1: What else do I need to prove I am authorized to take care of things? Do I need to give them a copy of the will? If so, does it have to be an official copy? Or is a photo copy sufficient? I also got married since that time so Q2: what do I need to show I'm the same person as described as executor? Is my marriage certificate good, or is there anything else I could use? To make matters more complicated, the credit union is in OR state and I'm unsure where the stock share is, if that matters. 

Also, Q3: is there anywhere to see if I'm missing any open accounts in his name? Like a website that shows what things are in your name? IDK.

I still have all the paperwork for pretty much everything. It's kind of all over the place and not organized, but if I received anything, I saved it.

And if anyone cares, I'm doing this now because I started getting enough medication for all my mental problems to be functional within the last year and decided to go through all our stuff in storage and downsize which includes a lot of paperwork.

I don't really want to get a lawyer because there isn't much money total and I don't have money to spend on it. And I don't really want to ask a lawyer for too much for free.

Thanks in advance for any help."
Legal advice about stimulus package &amp; taxes. My friend lives in Florida (20+) and her mother claimed my friend on her taxes without my friends permission and due to that she can’t claim her stimulus package. I was wondering what could be done about this? My friend doesn’t want her mom to be sent to jail or anything due to it but she’s unable to do her taxes or claim the stimulus due to it.
"1099 worker in Texas I currently live in Texas and my boss works and live in AZ. 

He has classified us as 1099 employees even tho there is no contract. I consistently work 30-40 hours a week. We make 15/ hr but we need to pay our own taxes. I’m not even sure he can legally classify us as 1099 employees. On top of this paychecks every spay day are 3-7 days late. 

Should I be going to the labor board about my company?"
Creating and backdating a lease for reimbursement purposes I have been living with a close friend who is the landlord in the Bay Area. I have been paying him rent via cash/Venmo but no lease was signed. My new employer is willing to reimburse one month of rent (in the past) but requires a signed lease and proof of payment. Would it be considered a crime if I created a lease now backdating the duration I have been staying with the friend and ask my friend to sign it?
"Custody During This Pandemic California. 

My ex and I have been separated for almost 6 years now and have never had a formal custody agreement. For a long time, we were able to be amicable. Basically throughout the last couple years, he would get upset about something and stop communicating with me and other childish things. I let it go because, honestly, it wasn’t ever anything that really effected me. I was irritated but that never seemed like a reason to waste the time and money on court and a lawyer to do custody. Plus I know it would be a fight and mentally taxing because he won’t agree with me on anything. 

Over the summer, he got mad at me about my decisions and stopped paying child support. That was almost a year ago. Luckily, I am able to support myself and my child without him, but that’s not the point of child support. I still didn’t take him to court. He then stopped communicating with me again so I made the decision to buy my daughter a phone, even though I didn’t want to (she’s 9) because I needed to be able to know if she’s ok. Through this, I started learning that when he has her (every weekend Friday through Sunday and some thursdays) he barely has her. He will take her to his grandparents house and then to his cousins house and sometimes he will see her for a few minutes on Saturday and then he will pick her up and drop her off to me Sunday at noon. 

This obviously upset me so I began documenting everything because I started planning on taking him to court. What has pushed me over the edge currently is that his job had a case of covid and he was exposed. I have a newborn and he didn’t tell me until he dropped our daughter off. Knowing that he exposed her. I then had to have her quarantined with my mom, which was still a risk because my mom doesn’t have the best immune system but it was safer than her being there with a newborn. So that was last week, she isn’t done being quarantined until Sunday. He wanted to pick her up on Thursday as normal. Him and I spoke about him not getting her for a month just in case which he claims he doesn’t remember saying. 

I have made the difficult decision to keep her from him. I don’t want to do this. But he is still going to work, he works in a small space with a lot of people. He doesn’t know who else was exposed. I don’t know what else to do for my daughters safety and the safety of my newborn. Legally, I know there is nothing he can do, we don’t have an agreement. But when we go to court, will this be used against me? Will a judge think I did a the wrong thing or the right thing? I feel like this is the right thing to do. If this virus wasn’t happening, I would have never even thought of keeping my daughter.   

Advice is welcome."
"Car accident help. Owner won’t provide insurance info to my lawyer Hey Reddit, so my car got totaled when I was rear ended (not my fault at all) and the driver fled the scene. I’m in Florida btw. Owner of the car says he didn’t drive the car and witnesses weren’t able to ID the driver. My lawyer sent letters to request the insurance information but the owner isn’t replying (apparently he doesn’t have to?) and their info is no where to be found. At this point am I just screwed ? The Detective on this case has closed it too because there’s no probable cause to arrest the owner of the car... I’m desperate for help at this point because these medical bills are outrageous. Sucks to have a car payment again but I got outta this in one piece so that’s the bright side. Thanks for your time."
"Adoptive father nullifying adoption and keeping my important stuff Let me start by saying that my adoptive father and I have never gotten along particularly well. My younger years were pretty hell, and I can elaborate details later. He has pretty severe control issues,

My father has made it clear that he would like to have not only my, but my brothers adoptions nullified. This is because he treated us like shit when we were young and living under his roof. However, now that we are old enough and don't live under his roof (therefore he cant control us), he's ready to be finished with us.

To make things easier to understand, he's the kind of person one posts about on r/insaneparents. Some talking points:

\-Stalked me throughout college 500 miles from home. (He would literally randomly show up around campus, driving rental cars. Security forced him to leave.)

\-Finding ways into accounts used not only for school, but personal use, and impersonating me to people who I know and friends. (This included changing passwords and accessing emails for the college I was working for at the time.)

\-Disrespects everyone that I choose to have relationships with-just because he can.

\-Threatens frivolous lawsuits because he knows that I cannot afford to handle a lawsuit (Who can?)

\-Decided that he is out to ruin my ""perfect little life"".

I tried to deal with and work with him to maintain a better father-son relationship after I moved out, thinking that this was ""normal"" and ""what everyone deals with"". I did this because I did not have an idea on what a normal parent-child relationship looks like.

THE MEAT AND TATERS'

After removing him and his negativity from my life, he now wants me to pick up my ""important documents"". Now, to those other Redditors who are adopted, they will have a very strong understanding of what these are-and how much they mean to someone who is adopted. These are the kinds of things like baby pictures, documents telling the story of your biological parents and things that tell the story truthfully.

After arguing back and forth about when and where I was going to get them from him, he decided that  he doesn't have to give them back, and he would rather just burn them than give them to me.I have always preferred to do things being the 'nice guy' but obviously this is not gonna happen.

What are my options? How should I proceed legally? Should I call the sheriffs department and have an escort? Do I have any right to the items, as they were given to me as a minor? 

State is Kentucky."
Can I go to jail for this? So 2 years ago my cousin helped me get my first car (I’m currently 22 and she’s 3 years older). We got the car completely in her name so I know legally it’s her car. I would pay her the payments for the car and everything was okay. We talked about switching the car over to my name and have me pay off the rest of my payments but the timing to go to these meetings would never work out. In February the cars engine over heated and needed a new engine entirely. The insurance we got with the car dealership said they would pay for some of the repairs at this time my cousin also was very pushy about switching the car over to my name but I kept telling her if we did the insurance wouldn’t pay nothing since that’s what they told me. We came to some agreement and waited till the car was fixed. Then the corona virus stoped the work on the car and the mechanic barely just opened up Monday and told me the amount I had to pay to fix the car. I didn’t have the money so I told him I’ll call him back when I did. Today my cousin sent me a very aggressive text saying that if she didn’t see the car today she would reported stolen and say I stole it. I replied saying where it was and told her I didn’t need to be threatens and was over the whole ordeal. Not long after she read my text the mechanic called me saying the car was reported stolen and reported saying I stole the car. What do I do now? How much trouble am I in for this ? What are my options ?
"Debt collector isn't negotiating much I have an unpaid tuition balance from 2015 that was originally $2800.   It's being handled by a collection agency currently, with settlements being approved/denied by the university.  The university said that they wouldn't go below the principle balance and that they needed to pay the collection agency.  Principal balance is $2800, interest is $2400 and collection costs are $1600, for a total of $6900.  I offered $3000, and they countered with $6000.  It seems like theyre not being very flexible,  I know the statute of limitations will expire in a year, so they can still sue.  Any advice on what I should offer or on how to get them to be flexible?"
"[North Dakota] Received a 3-day intent to evict. I haven't been to work in 2 months because of Covid Long story short, as of May 1st I am 2 months past due on my rent and today I recieved a 3-day intent to evict notice. I get this and normally would agree with it, but I haven't been able to work since late April because my girlfriend was put on a doctor-ordered quarantine and my workplace told me since we live together, ""don't come back on the premesis until her quarantine is up"". I filed for unemployment and was approved, but something happened on their end and I am still waiting to receive any payment. I've made several calls to my apartment management explaining the situation and each time they told me it was not a problem and we would figure out a payment plan when I went back to work. I still dont know when that will be. I have a place to go if I am evicted, so I'm not concerned about actually having to move but if I am evicted can I be held responsible for paying the remaining months on my lease?

"Being paid under state minimum wage... Hello Reddit users, for reference I work at Lowe’s in New York it is considered essential and so is thriving under the covid-19 just with “safety measures” to prevent the spread of the disease...

Anyways so me and my three buddies started about a month ago and for the past 3 paychecks my pay has not only been underneath both my buddies but it is also under minimum wage for New York which is $11.80 we all have the same job and we all started at the same time I am black and one of my buddies is also and my other buddy is white...(this matter as I will explain in a second) but I was told by a manger as I questioned my pay and why after talking 3 times my pay was and is still below minimum wage and was told it’s based off work experience like powered machinery work and such and also that my pay should be fixed...Keep in mind we’re all three college students looking who were looking for a job for a little...My black buddy worked at a Lowe’s before and put it on his application when he applied and my white friend worked in food and so too do I. My white friend gets $12.65 an hour and my other buddy gets $11.99 and I make a whopping $11.33 Now I know it might not be directly but I see no other reason why my buddy who only worked fast food should be paid more than my buddy who worked in a Lowe’s and has forklift and power machine training? Is there anything that can be applied to this situation? Among other things what major things can I do? I want to be paid at least minimum wage but is this technically discrimination? It kind of feels like it bc of how the pay worked out with my white friend getting paid more than us for the same kind of experience as me and less than my buddy who is also black... what can be done here legally without me losing my job and a bunch of money?"
"Mom is taking care of my Grandma and using her money...my uncles are threatening to sue and I am worried for my Mom First time poster.

My grandma has three children. My mom and my two uncles. My grandparents lived across the country, but after my grandpa died, the uncles stopped seeing or helping my grandma. My mom eventually moved my grandma to our state and had her live in a very very expensive retirement community.

My grandma started to have worse and worse dementia and a few months ago my mom and Grandma had to move in together. I am visiting and my grandma needs constant care. She cannot turn the stove on by herself and refuses to shower. She refuses to have any help come in so my mom is her personal chef, nurse and everything. My mom has to be at the house most of the day and can't really have a full time job unless they paid someone else to nurse my grandma, but grandma refuses.

My mom has power of attorney and is using my grandma's money to pay the rent, buy groceries and gives herself some money from my Grandma's saving. She also has been buying extra things for the house and things for herself like clothes, but she has purchased a few extensive items like a new computer using my grandma's money.

My grandma knows about the rent and the food, but she always complains that she is paying all the rent (although we saved her over $1,200 by moving her from the living center to this much bigger and better house). On top of that, if my grandma has less then 130,000 in her bank account, she qualifies for some kind of veterans assistance so my mom has been slowly taking money out of her account so she can get help when the time comes to need more help. Otherwise, that money would go away pretty fast if she had to pay for constant nurses and care.

My uncle threatened to call the police when they were moving in together and they think my Mom is being abusive toward her and spending all her money and taking advantage of her. They refuse to believe my grandma has any problems and have no appreciation that my mom dropped everything to care for my grandma all day. Her will is split three ways between the two uncles and my mom.

I have talked to my mom about having a written agreement that grandma pays her a certain amount per/month to have it all in writing, but my grandma refuses to admit she needs help or there is anything wrong with her or that my mom even helps her with anything. When my uncles calls, she complains about how badly she is being treated and that she wants to leave. They never visit her or even call her and have no interests in ever taking care of her.

When she dies, can my uncles sue my mom for the money she is using  and how can she protect herself from that.

Edit-I live in the USA

Edit 2- Forgot to clarify that my grandma cannot take care of ANY of her finances and fight my mom on everything. She refuses to pay her taxes and has spent up to 30,000 on investment scam stuff. My mom has to pay her taxes and cancel these scams somewhat against her will. Even if we get written agreements, it is probable that she will forget and deny she signed them if someone asked.  "
"AT&amp;T Charging us for a phone we never had So about a month ago my mother realized that we were being charged for a Samsung phone that we don’t have. We all have iPhones, so this was very shocking. She figured out that we were being charged 20$ a month plus tax for about 17 months for some Samsung phone that we never had. So when she found this out that this was happening she immediately called and talked about the issue and got no where, so we canceled the plan and now on last months bill we were charged a 60$ cancellation fee for a phone we never had!?! This is ridiculous and she has gotten no where with trying to fix it. I have read some other posts here about similar problems and they have said that they got it resolved with the FCC. So I have told her to try resolving it with them. This is my first time posting to reddit but I’ve been a browser for a while and was hoping for any advice on how to resolve this issue.
I hope everyone is doing well during theses crazy time stay healthy and Thankyou for the help

Edit some bot said I didn’t give a location so we live in Arizona if that helps in any way lmao"
"Just recieved a series of emails from Ebay for an account I didn't create. I recieved several emails this morning from ebay regarding an account I didn't create.  General welcome to ebay, congrats on becoming a seller, your first listing is posted, then lastly, your account has been suspended.  I don't see any easy ways of reporting that this isn't my account, so I was going to ignore the whole series because it seems like Ebay took it offline and I don't really want to spend an hour on the phone with customer service, but I want to make sure that doesn't open me up to any liability for anything.  Safe to ignore?

"Lease agreements My husband and I have property in Michigan.  Two of our friends built two tiny cabins with their own money on the land.  We want to make sure that we set up safeguards to protect ourselves from any miscommunication, or legal loopholes they could use to procure the land the structure is on.  I love and trust my friends, however I prefer no room for error here.

 We want to:
 Clarify we will pay them for the structures if they ever decide to leave permanently.

If they want to leave and have the structure leased we will perform upkeep and have an agreed upon amount we distribute the income. 

 Is a normal lease sufficient considering they built these structures and in consideration of the other aspects of our agreement. 

Edit: clarification"
"Mother had temporary custody of my daughter. Now she’s an Invalid. Can I get my daughter back? In 2012 I was moving to NY for school. My daughter had asthma an my mother needed to be able to take her to appointments when needed. We did a temporary custody agreement with the courts. I am back in FL 30 minutes away from them.
Fast forward to 2019; my mother technically died for 10 minutes after a procedure. She’s unable to walk, barely can talk, and she’s a living “Lucy” from 50 first dates (Meaning she’s unable to retain current memories). 
My father is now my mothers power of attorney and has been caring for my daughter. He’s not a good person and I won’t go into detail about that , I just now see he’s following the same pattern as he did with me a child and I don’t want that. Am I able to get her back? How so? Will this be an easy thing to do or should I expect lawyers and such to get involved in a case like this?

Edit: I have NOT spoken to my father about getting her back yet. I’m just wanting to know my options and/or what paperwork needs to be completed before I speak to him. In the event that he tells me straight up NO, I’ll have paperwork to back things up. I hope this clears things up. 

Edit 2: I returned to two years later so I’ve been in her life and we have a VERY good relationship. My mother and I never went to the courts to switch things back because she was going to school in a different county. My mother was essentially raising her. My father had no part in that. Now he apparently does since she’s unable to. Please save the judgement on this. I’m just asking what I need to do NOW so a little girl isn’t raised by a monster. Thanks"
"Is there anything you can do as a bystander for domestic abuse in Arizona? I don’t know much about the law regarding domestic abuse in Arizona but I have called 911 4 times on my neighbor and our other neighbor has called about 8 or 9 times. The couple is a guy and a girl, and often times I will hear him body slam her against a wall and hear her gasp for air. I have heard her plead for her life, cry and beg him not to hurt her, and so much more horrible things. I have some of the audio on video and I have offered it to the police but they declined. No case has been opened because only family can open one. The girl has been trapped inside for months. I saw her trying to leave once and he forced her back in. She was covered in bruises. 

Today I saw her get into their truck and she was trying to leave. He ran out and told her to get back in. They fought, but not physically, because I was right next to them, pretending to have issues with my car. She said she was tired of being hurt and she feared for her life, he said he would “never hurt her again”

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want her to get hurt but I don’t think there’s much I can do as a bystander. Should I get more video evidence? Should I try to file a report? Is there anything I can do? If you need specifics, this is in Maricopa County"

Landlord claims I went over on utilities In this situation can I demand to see evidence of usage?
"eBay buyer falsely claimed I had sent him the wrong item, then he returned the item he claimed I had sent him I sold this person an item (Item A) on eBay recently. The individual lives in another state. After receiving the item, he opened a request for returns (I do not accept returns by default) stating that the item was not as described. He claimed that instead of receiving Item A, he received a different product (Item B). As per eBay policy, I created a label for the buyer to send the item back.

Today, I received the return package in the mail, and as expected, he had sent Item B. This is an item I have never owned, and it is a product that the buyer clearly intended to sell at some point. Instead, he kept Item A that I had sent him and sent Item B back instead, claiming that Item B is what he received from me. Interestingly, after he opened a request for the return, he took down a listing for Item B that he had up.

Due to how eBay works, there is a real chance that I may have to refund the buyer, and there is a real chance I may not get my item back. Is there any legal discourse for dealing with this buyer who is clearly trying to defraud me and/or eBay?"
"Leak in condo... ""at fault"", insurance, legal action against another owner? There was a leak in my condo on floor 3. It leaked down and damaged floor 2 and floor 1 (me). Plumber confirmed the leak was coming from 3. Damages to 1 and 2 include mold removal and drywall repair. 

Spoke to HOA this morning, who said our complex has a subjugation clause, so owner to owner we can’t battle it out - my insurance company can’t go after her insurance company for reimbursement. He said I have three options:

* Get repairs to drywall done at my own cost, pay up front
* Go through my own insurance to pay for drywall repair
* Wait it out and see if floor 3 steps up and her insurance pays for drywall repair 

(But it seems like for the second or third options, I'm still fronting cost.)

The mold removal, on the other hand, is not covered by any of our insurance. The HOA paid for removal up front, and will be charging it to 3. He said, “We’ll try to charge her. We have limitations. We haven’t had problems before, we do this a lot. There’s a good chance we can get everything from her. But in the even that for some reason she won’t pay, we’ll come to you for payment.” 

I’m so lost. 

1. Should I go to the HOA to ask to know what they will do to try and ""force"" her to pay? (I've never dealt with something like this. Don't know if they will threaten legal action...)
2. If she refuses to pay, can the HOA just turn around and ask *me* to pay instead? What if I refuse? Am I responsible because it's my unit, even though damage was caused by another unit and it was proven? 
3. Is there any documentation I should be looking for? CC&amp;R's... local laws... I don't even know! 
4. At what point would I begin to look into legal action? Do I even have any options? I thought maybe small claims court, but just Googled it and it appears the minimum is $10,000 which, even between floors 1 and 2, wouldn't cover (my mold removal is about $1,600)

"Landlord not releasing overcharged rent. I am currently leasing an apartment in Virginia. My lease ends on May 12th and I am moving into a home I am purchasing. I submitted my intent to vacate in accordance with my lease.

I receive a notice on my door about my last months rent payment. On this notice it stated that my last month of rent wouldn't be auto withdrawn using their payment portal and I would have to pay with a check. Last week I checked my back account and their system withdrew a full months rent any way. My wife called them and they stated that it would credit my account the full rent amount. Checking the website revealed that my account wasn't credited a full months rent so I proceeded to call them.

I was told that they were holding my extra payment until we move out and they would add it in with my security deposit return and if any repairs would need to be made, they would deduct if from my extra rent. I might need the money to help with closing costs and this could be a very large problem.

My question is are they legally allowed to hold onto my ill-gotten payment and the fact that their written notice instructed me not to disable autopay seems kind of fishy. I didn't see anything in the virginia landlord - Tennant handbook or my lease about returning rent overpayment.

Thank you!"
"Had a guy give an estimate on a deck build. Don't want to use his services. Arkansas I had a ""good ole boy"" come by and give me an estimate to build a deck here in rural Arkansas. In just a few short days my financial situation has changed drastically. I cannot afford to pay him to build the deck any more. I signed a notebook scratch piece of paper w/ the estimate numbers (in pink highlighter) but with literally no verbiage whatsoever. I did not get a copy(that was a mistake). Now that I have told him I do not want to have him build the deck he has requested that I pay him $200 (10% of the labor) for the estimate. I am willing to pay him $100 because  I do value everyone's time and don't want to waste it, but he was here for 20 minutes. Is that piece of paper legally binding at all?"
"Breaking lease early due to uninhabitable situation State: CA

I've recently lost a bike that was tied to my balcony (I'm on the first floor). This happened while I was asleep at night, during the shelter-in-place period. It's almost impossible for someone to reach and grab from the outside of the balcony - someone has to have jumped over the fence and then grab it. I do live in a gated community (so it's gated, and then I have a 6ft tall wall around the balcony). I don't feel safe living in this unit anymore so I have tried to contact the leasing office to transfer to another unit but they have failed to respond back to me for 3 weeks.

Due to increase in thefts and car break-ins due to economy pitfall, I'm pretty confident more thefts will happen. What really concerns me is though there is no surveillance system to the gate of the community, and the balcony door is very.. balcony-door-ish. Meaning it has a huge square-glass in the middle that anyone can break in. It was not really a problem when I moved in, but now I actually experienced burglary, I do feel little unsafe and the leasing office has done no effort to do accommodate. Actually, even before trying to accommodate, they have ignored my calls and when they picked up and said the manager will get back to me, she never did. I don't even know if she got the message tbh. Can this be suitable for uninhabitable situation? I'm ultimately trying to break the lease without penalty and move out of this community.

EDIT: so the leasing office sent out an email saying they have acknowledged increased number of break ins of cars and multiple thefts and working with individuals who have been in such situations which I didn’t get for a month. I just can’t believe this degree of negligence."
"[TX] Got a good deal on an apartment from a third-party service, now they want to raise rent two-fold. I moved into a new place via a third-party service similar to AIRBNB.  This firm advertised a discounted rate from the beginning of May until the beginning of August due to COVID-19. I spoke with a salesperson and she let me know that renewing on these dates wouldn't be a problem and she emailed me the prices of the discounted units.

I reserved the apartment for the month of May and made it clear that I would also like to reserve for the following two months at the beginning of those respective months.

I decided to call up the salesperson to ensure that the deal was still valid. Only when I spoke to her was I made aware of the doubling in price. I told her that I felt cheated and she said she would look to see what she could do. 

Do I have anything that I could do here?"

"Cybersquatting and TM issues I've owned a small but fairly well known USA-based record label since 1989. The name is not a registered trademark, but I have used it commercially and consistently on nearly 80 records and CDs over the years. I first registered a domain identical to the company name in 1999. I was a couple days late renewing that registration in 2018 and someone else bought it. They didn't make contact or build a site at the URL. That all changed a few months ago. They currently have a site that is actively impersonating my business, including content from our old version of the site. They even cribbed an album description that includes my name and where and when I started the business. My email address is even on there. They also set up accounts on social media using the company name, although there is no activity by those accounts. So this has gone from ""I guess we need a new URL, my bad"" to ""this jackass is really making things difficult"" Although we've created a new site/domain, we aren't showing up in google searches, but the squatter still is. There are workarounds to drive traffic, and other steps have been taken, but the problem persists.

Clearly, registering my mark must be done. The lack thereof has prevented me from getting their host to take down the infringing site. But I only have so much money, and don't want to deplete my accounts in these uncertain times. Additional options, as I see it.

I could offer the squatter money to buy the name back. Likely the cheapest option, assuming they would accept an offer under $1k.

I could buy yet another domain name, along the lines of ""real\_\_\_\_\_\_records.com"" The one we're using now probably isn't close enough to the business name.

I can file a UDRP claim. $1500+, but I worry the lack of registered TM could be an issue.

File suit under the ACPA, This is the most expensive route, but I'm tempted by the possibility of the squatter paying damages and losing all the domain names they own. Then again, they may not have the money, or live outside the US. The fact that they have used content from my old site without realizing its meaning leads me to believe they do not speak English.

Specific question: if I successfully buy back the domain name from the squatter, would I still be able to file an ACPA suit at a later date?"
"Does non-compete mean payment? Some backstory:

I was freelancing in the past to develop a medical SaaS platform/tool for a doctor that has his own LLC.

Later on as in years later(after I'm done working with him) I get this job as a contractor for a medical corporation. The corp does not know anything about the previous stuff, I didn't use that as a selling point to get in.

The issue is, this SaaS thing we're still trying to get off the ground. What it does is not related to who I work for that I'm aware of. The tech I work with in my day job has no resemblance to the previous job. At this time I've just said ""I can't get paid for this"". It's fine with me, my thought is, this side thing is like a backup plan. I want it to become a business so then they could hire me in the future.

It's just concerning since they're both medically related. I don't see them becoming competitors I mean this is like an ant vs. Goliath situation.

The freelance gig I signed a contract I'm pretty sure that said I own nothing of what I develop, so I'm just an hourly joe/tech advisor."
"[California] I have a bill from a hospital that I can't afford, already got the itemized bill but I was only supposed to be there for 1 day but they kept me there for 3 I had a hip replacement, I couldn't go home because I needed a walker but they took 3 days for me to get one and in the end I couldn't use it because it was too small and my insurance didn't cover anything bigger (my hip was swollen) so I had my wife bring crutches I had from home and it was more difficult to use those 

The total bill was around 145k but insurance covered most of it and I owe almost 6 thousand

I called a while back for the itemized receipt thinking they'd cut it down (advice from Reddit) but it's still the same and idk what I'm reading, but I thought it was suspicious that the operator was pushing for a monthly payment plan instead of giving me the itemized receipt"
"Oregon: Selling a vehicle that is paid off, title in hand but I have not registered for a new title. In Oregon it states that once you pay a car off and receive the title from the bank you must register for a new title to clear the Lien Holders name off of the title. Normally I wouldn't be apposed to doing this but I am currently on a time frame as I will be selling this vehicle.

If I were to have an interested buyer for private party sale or if I were to trade the vehicle into a dealership. Do I first need to first send the title back in to the DMV to get a new ""clean"" title, or may I go ahead and now also release the title to the buyer and when they register the vehicle, they will then pay for the new registration?

With everything currently going on in the world (COVID-19) DMV offices are not open and so I feel this process is just going to eat up more time and the ''buyer'' may not want to wait even though the bank has released interest in the vehicle. Even if the DMV offices were open I still feel like this would take an extremely long time just because it takes the bank 10-20 business to send you the title and then you would have register for a ""Clear Title"" in which the DMV usually advertise takes up to 6-8 weeks to get you a new title. 

Has anyone sold a vehicle in Oregon in which they have paid their car off and received the title but did not get a new ""clear title""

"Can my grandmother (69) legally be evicted from her home? (OHIO) My grandmother (69) has lived in the same house for the last 13-14 years with her husband. They divorced, then reconciled with plans on getting remarried. Before that could happen, he passed away. 
His son had power of attorney, and where my grandmother and step-grandfather divorced, my grandmother wasn’t written into the will. 
It has been 2-3 weeks since my grandfather died. Now, his son is telling my grandmother she has to leave by the 6th of June. He isn’t letting her take anything that belonged to my grandfather, despite knowing they were going to remarry. My grandfather owned the house, so now his son legally has the right to it. 
Is there anything she can do? TIA"
"Receiving bills after stepdad was killed Location: Stanislaus county, CA

My stepdad was killed in an accident at our home. An ambulance came but he already passed away by the time they arrived. They did not take him in the ambulance. A bill was sent to us for the ambulance in his name. Does it have to be paid? My mom and I are confused because we read California is a community property state, so they could come after the house if we don't pay it. 

Also, he was an organ donor and they used many of his organs. My mom received a bill for the organ donation from the morgue. I never heard of that before. It doesn't sound right to be charged for making a donation.

Now we are concerned about receiving more bills, like firetruck, credit cards, etc.
Overall I want to make sure my mom's house is protected. At first I thought she didn't have to pay for anything in his name only (from reading other posts) but after reading California is a community property state I'm more confused."
"I 21[F] am currently raising my younger brother [13]. His dad wants him too come back too live with him, but my brother doesnt want too. What can I do? A bit of background on our mother and my brothers father.


Growing up our mother was neglectful and abusive, but she was an avid worker (a bit of a workaholic) and was always at least able too give us food, clothes, and a place too live. About 2 1/2 years ago, that changed She has since quit her job, cashed out her 401k way too early, and has been moving around so abruptly and suddenly that my brother only found out by me having too tell him, because she insisted I not say anything too him and just ""surprise"" him by dropping him off in a whole other house/town while he stayed with me over breaks. This happened LITERALLY every time he came too my house, which was around every 3 weekends. Her and her BF refuse too hold jobs, they rotate between living off of her mother and my great grandparents while they dream crazy dreams, like running away too join the circus. (They actually tried too take my brother with them to join a traveling circus). I could go on and on, but I feel this is enough too price shes an unfit mother.

His father on the other hand, I am unsure of. When my mother was with him, (at least 10 years ago) he was an abusive alcoholic. I was young and dont remember much, but I do remember I didnt like him. Me and my Husband met him awhile back, and he seems too have changed his act. Hes been in AA for about 3 years, he has 2 kids that he takes care and a stable job. He says he is through with his ex wife the mother of the 2 kids he has now, who is currently in prison for stabbing him with a fork.

I have signed POAs from his father and our mother. His father signed it with the agreement that my brother would go back too him at the end of the summer. It is now about time for him too go, and my brother doesnt want too. He enjoys the school he has here, his friends, and he says his dad has hardly reached out too him at all during the 8 months he has been with me. He never had much of a relationship with his dad, and his dad has never gone out of his way too try and start one either.

Is there anything I can do too get legal custody without having too railroad his father? I dont want a legal battle, and I certainly dont want there too be any resentment between him and his dad if I make him go back. I just want my brother too be where he is happy and feels safe, and that is here. 

I'm really sorry for the long post. It's a very complicated situation, and this isnt even all of it. Any advice is appreciated. If it helps, we live in Texas."
"Am I responsible for my neighbors dogs and kids health in my yard when I spray weeds? My neighbor across the street lets his dogs and kids run all over the neighborhood. I'm going to spray my weeds with some high grade herbicide. His children are stupid and I would not count on them to refrain from eating my plants. They already dig holes and throw rocks in my lawn. The question is, if they get sick or a dog dies am I liable?"
"Apartment owners resuming construction under my feet during shelter-in-place, so I can't escape the disruption. What can I do? So, I live in a unit owned by a large property management company in San Francisco. Nothing special.

The ground floor of the building is mainly a garage. The floor right above it is the first of three residential floors and is where I live. Some time last year the company began construction to convert the garage into new apartment units. They advertised it as ""solving the housing puzzle"" or something ridiculous like that.

As you can guess, the construction work has been incredibly disruptive. From Monday-Friday 8am-6pm, literally just below my feet is non-stop jack hammering, nailing, and sawing. If I happen to still be in my room when they are working, it is impossible to hear myself think. Luckily I have a job that allows me to work from home, but attempting it is horrendous. Business calls are impossible, and my colleagues comment that it sounds like I am ""inside hell"". I had been trying to stay in a percentage of the time due to recovering from a foot injury, but the noise has pretty much driven me out during working hours.

Anyways, fast forward to the current COVID situation. Once San Francisco's shelter-in-place orders first went out, the construction stopped which was fantastic thank god. I could not imagine being forced to quarantine in my room all day while that construction was going on, much less be able to concentrate on work. Well the calm didn't last long. Today they started rolling out plastic protection onto the floors again and posted fliers that they would resume construction next week and continue through Spring 2021. 

According to the flier: ""This work has been deemed essential by the City and County of San Francisco and is permitted to continue while the Shelter-in-Place order is active.""

This became the worst possible scenario: being trapped next to a construction site. In my opinion, it diminishes the livability of my unit. Can I legally do anything about this, such as demand some sort of compensation or challenge it?

Thanks."
"Charge for prescription after coverage ended 9 days after my coverage ended a prescription was billed against my old medical plan.

Today I received an audit payment for 133$ for my prescription. I also noticed my credit score dropped 20 points.

"Company relocated my family, then delayed my start date with no pay or benefits Hi all!

About two months ago I got hired by a multi-billion $$ government contracting company as a Systems Administrator for a 30+ year long contract they own. After passing background, etc I was given a start date, offered a full relocation, sign on bonus (haven’t been paid), etc. When we arrived in our new location (Utah), from California, my HR rep gave me a new start date two weeks out due to an issue with my security clearance. That two weeks came around and they canceled that start date as well without giving me a new one. Throughout the last two months, I’ve been getting a run around saying they’re waiting on the government to authorize me to come onsite and start work. 

Today, two months later, I just received an email from the same rep saying the government won’t authorize me to work on the contract until my security clearance investigation is complete, which is estimated to take about 240 days. Apparently the company had overlooked the fact that my clearance was due for an investigation and authorized a start date and relocation for us anyway. Clearance investigations are done every 6 years and I just happened to accept this job offer right before mine was due. 

My family and I are now in a new home with a lease and have gone over two months without pay or benefits. We are on our last stretch with our emergency savings and honestly cannot wait until September/October for my clearance investigation to be completed. 

What can I do in this situation? I know the company has the funding for my role, they receive that from the government before opening the requisition. I can’t really leave this role as I’ve already signed a hiring contract which states if I left within a year of employment I’ll have to pay back my relocation package. On top of that, this company is sponsoring my clearance. They’re not allowing me to onboard, do training, etc so they’re refusing to pay me."
"[CA] Landlord deducting from Security Deposit after 21 days and without paperwork The housing situation I just left had a lot of informalities. The decision for me to give 30 days notice of my intent to leave was done over facebook messenger in conversation with the landlord, the landlord acknowledged it, the notice i gave was prompted by him telling me he wanted me to leave.

21 days pass and I reach out several times in that period to ask for my deposit to be returned. He said he would deal with it within the time frame.

Today was day 22, I texted him, he acknowledged in a message that he lost track of time and it was indeed day 22. He sent me my deposit over venmo detailing a number of deductions for bills and things of that nature. No receipts.

From a legal standpoint, neither of us did the correct thing in terms of making a physical paper trail. There is just emails, facebook messages, and text messages.

Do I have recourse to get the rest of my deposit back? Or does my failure to send my notice by physical mail mean I have no leg to stand on?"

The car has sat for a while because the brakes are shot. The seats are moldy from a broken window motor but the car should start if I jump it.

People just park on the side of the road and often just stroll in our property to get down to the river. I know their intent is just to swim, and I understand that.

"Parenting Plan NEED HELP I will try to keep this as short as I can. My venue is Texas. Long story short: voluntarily allowed my parents to have custody of my son while I got on my feet, now I want to modify our order. 

I need unbiased legal advice. I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. When my son was three, I was sent to a pain management clinic for endometriosis and put on oxycodone. I became dependent on it, and was much less functional while on oxycodone all day. That made my mental illness spiral out of control. I went to an inpatient mental health facility and did ECT, and during that time my parents called CPS. CPS investigated me, and found no reason to take my child. But, my father is a legal professional and my mother is a teacher, and at the time I was unstable and could not provide for my son the way he deserved. I agreed to allow my parents to be the primary conservators of my son with the understanding this was just until I could get on my feet. Yes, I was stupid to believe them, but I cannot rewind. 

My son is now 9. In six years I got off of the pain medications, got my mental illnesses stabilized, went back to college and obtained my bachelor’s degree, started a new career doubling my income, became completely self sufficient. I have maintained my stability for 3 years. When I got my own place, I moved into an apartment less than 2 minutes of a drive from my parents house. I have seen my son nearly every day for 5 years. I go to my parents house after work everyday and stay until he goes to bed at 8:30 pm. He was spending the night irregularly when it was convenient for my mom or she was in a good mood, otherwise she makes excuses. Our order doesn’t currently provide me the amount of time I do get to see him, so if I tell her the order allows me every other weekend, she argues that the order doesn’t allow me to come over every day to see him and she will happily abide by the order meaning less time with my son for me. 

I have recently been requesting to change the order. I feel as if I am in a good enough position to have joint custody with my parents, with alternating weeks of visitation. However, with my father being a well known legal professional in our county, and my mother’s perception of me, I’m terrified I am going to upset them, lose all of the extra time I have with my son now, and a judge say the current order should stand.

I have drafted the Modification of Custody Order with my suggestion of alternating weeks, and I want to provide those to my parents and ask if we can civilly agree on this. I am prepared for the rejection and outrage from them, and am preparing to hire an attorney. Before I jump into this, any advice? Do I have a decent case? I can’t keep doing what I am doing. My mom and I do not get along, and I need more time with my son. I thought I was doing what was best for him, and now I feel like I made a mistake."
"can my landlord (management company) ask to remove my lawn furniture from the other side of backyard of duplex? So, I am a renter of side by side duplex unit that shares both front and back yards. We have separate entrance on either side. Front yard has identical portion for both of us, but back yard is asymmetrical and only the other side has flat stone floored back yard portion directly their side between their unit and garage, and we don't.

It is in Lake Oswego, Clackamas county, Oregon. 97034.

* currently the other side is vacant and they are doing showings.
* All backyard was taken over by former tenant which were owner's family and We were ok sharing.
* My current lease does not dictate that we cannot use their side of backyard-there is no specific.
* managent is asking us not to use that side bc it is directly behind of that unit, even though it is vacant.
* &amp;#x200B;
* &amp;#x200B;

\#1 I am not sure if I am legally prohibited using that space? I mean I COULD not use that space anyway when the next tenant moves in bc it is really on their side even tough we do not have the equivalent. HOWEVER it is VACANT now and they are asking me to remove my lawn furniture seems they crossed the line. I COULD remove the furniture to show the cleaner backyard for showing but I don't think I AM OBLIGATED TO.

\#2 Can they just show up to the property (shared yards) and take pictures of the back yard with me being there without notice? I was shocked that they just showed up and taking pictures while me and my kids were on the back yard yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3 can they take pictures of inside of my unit without written consent while they do annual ""inspection""? they did notice to entering unit 24 hr before, but I was surprised that they took pictures of our bed rooms and other spaces without our consent. We did consent they come in for inspection, but did not consent taking picture???? (I was not there but my husband was and he felt discomfort but it just happened too quick and he missed opportunity to ask)

"False Rape HR Email - Do I do anything? \[TX\]

Hi everyone,

Roughly two days ago I received an instagram message from an account with no followers/no pictures claiming that I raped their friend as they were sleeping. This caught me completely off guard so I took this as some weird bot account I told them to screw off, that those kinds of claims aren't funny and I never would do something like that, and then blocked them.

My HR director calls me today and forwards me an email where the same instagram tag (only with an email account after it) claims that I raped them. They provide zero background or anything, just wrote my name, my position at the company, and then said I raped them and gave them an STD (not sure if its relevant but I did a physical two weeks ago and am clean). It is clear to me they found my linkedin, and thus my employer, through my name being on my instagram- so that was a rough lesson learned on internet privacy.

This is a small company and we know each other well, so HR has told me they believe me and will move on (also due to the weird email address that sent the email/their changing of my foreign name spelling in the email multiple times based on what social media they got their info on/and the lack of any detail), but that this is on the record now for liability reasons. That is fine and I get it, an accusation like this is serious. That said, I am scared of this individual continuing to send harassing emails to executives at my company if they do not receive a response from HR and my company viewing me poorly as a result.

I want to forget about this and for it to go away, but I do not want to stick my head in the sand. I've never done anything remotely close to sexual assault or taking advantage of a woman. I've had girls be upset that I didn't want to date them, but I seriously can't see any of them being this mad to try and ruin my career. I don't expect any law enforcement action against me, because I didn't do anything, but I wonder if this is something I need to report to them? I doubt they care...

Sorry guys, I'm a bit scrambled, but this is the wildest thing I've ever experienced and don't know what to do as a next step and it freaks me out. Looking back I should've just never replied to a clearly fake instagram account and painted myself as a target for who knows what...."
"Roommate moved out with no warning, did not pay rent, over $1500 in damages to the master bedroom. She has completely ghosted me. How do I proceed? (US, Colorado) This is a follow up regarding [my post](https://redd.it/gaq19p) from 8 days ago.

Summary from previous post: Roommate tried to break the lease under Colo. Rev. Stat. § 38-12-402, claiming a stalker is trying to break into her window on the 4th floor at night to rape her.

In an email exchange with my roommate and the apartment manager, I told her I'm happy to work with her so this process is fair for everyone. I offered to start looking for a new roommate after finals (next week) and I'll sign her off the lease as soon as she pays for the damages to the master and May's rent.

-----

She ignored my offer and insisted she could break the lease and be absolved from this apartment with nothing more than a police report number. The leasing office manager didn't buy her story, and requested an official police report and RO. She stopped responding to emails after that.

On May 5th, she showed up with her new boyfriend (the 4th one she's been able to manipulate since living with me) and a moving truck. She packed up and told a huge lie about how a local charity is going to pay her rent and damages to the bedroom.

I haven't heard from her since she moved out (unsurprising). I sent her one final text this morning reminding her that she is still on the lease here, and she is legally just as responsible for this apartment as I am. No reply.

I'd like to start looking for a new roommate (probably not on reddit), but no one is going to move into a bedroom in this condition. The room stinks. Her cat scratched up and peed on the carpet for months. The walls are covered in grease patches where her bed was. She spilled eyebrow wax and make up all over the master bathroom counter, sink, and white cabinets. She's damaged the walls with stickers that won't come off. She ripped the screen off one of her windows and has been throwing garbage out the window onto the roof...

The maintenance manager estimated damages will cost over $1500. This apartment is newly renovated with brand new carpet installed before I moved in. He said the entire bedroom would need to be re-painted. They are going to try to get the bathroom professionally cleaned, but he is concerned about the make up stains and wax.

I applied for help through my Uni's emergency fund program when my roommate started lying about the rapist. I was approved for an $800 micro-grant, which will cover most of her rent for May. I still need to (somehow) pay for repairs to the master, have the work done, and find another roommate before June 1st.

I will continue to work as a TA while taking classes this summer, but I don't have an extra $1500 lying around. I have enough money budgeted to cover my half of rent and utilities until I get my next grant and scholarship disbursement for the fall, but that money is earmarked for rent and bills during the fall semester (I graduate spring, 2021).

I don't know what to do next. I've lived at this apartment complex for almost 5 years with perfect payment history. The leasing office manager isn't charging late fees and she's willing to work with me on this issue, but they understandably can't repair the room for free.

Sorry this post became so long... This situation is insane and I can't begin to describe the amount of stress this has caused during finals.

**TL;DR: My roommate abandoned our apartment without paying rent and left a bedroom that needs over $1500 in repairs. I can't afford to pay for the repairs or this apartment by myself, and I can't find a new roommate until the bedroom is repaired. What can I do from here?**"
"Landlord favors junkies (NY) My husband and I and our 2 kids (3f and 2m) live in a house divided into 5 apartments. The ones who live above us are crack heads/alcoholics. We used to be friends when we first moved in but I guess they just wanted an ally in getting rid of the neighbors next door to us. Drug dealers. Go figure. 

Anyways, the past 2 years they have been harassing everyone in the house. They are verbally abusive, threaten violence and pound on the ceiling to scare our kids at all times of the day and night, just because. I have kept a detailed log of all this. Day/time/what they did/what was occuring at the time they pulled their crap etc. And although it's been going on 2 years I have only made the logs for the  past 6 months. And they're extensive.

We have talked to our landlord. We have called the cops. We have tried being civil. We have tried to match their crazy. And according to the officer that stopped by last night, said there is absolutely nothing we can do. So I asked about a restraining order. He stated we couldn't get one because we don't have a 'domestic relationship'.

We need any advice anyone can give. But don't tell us we should just move, because if it was that simple we would have been gone months ago. No money, no help from social services, no option to stay with friends or family. We are stuck at this time. We have nowhere else to go. 

What is my landlord legally responsible for? He has been made aware many times and all he says is he will talk to them. But he either never does or they just don't care. The list of their bs is long. Including false CPS reports (Child Protective Services). And then blocking our ability to comply with the one requirement we were tasked with. 

They are verbally abusive and threaten physical violence. But our landlord only cares about money. Even the officer who responded last night said he's a slum lord. What can we do? My husband is worried if we don't have any choice and they keep pushing, that he will end up in jail for beating them to a pulp. Please help!"
"Nurse just berated and embarrassed my fiance who is in critical condition. Please help So, long story short, but gets longer. my fiance ended up getting a bacterial infection. The doctors were leaning towards a tick bite since I had pull one off of her shortly to her getting sick. Let me be clear. My fiance is an IV drug user. She was prescribed far too much pain medicine for far to long for a back injury, and ended up dependant on the medication. She voluntary stopped going to the doctor herself, and started trying to ween herself off.

Come now. She started getting very I'll, and very dehydrated as she wouldn't drink or eat. We went to an urgent care and the doctor there was informed she was an IV drug user and the doctor said I don't believe this is relevant, I believe we're more leaning towards the bug bite turning to staph, or maybe a tick borne illness which we won't know till we get the tick panel back. 

Well things just went downhill from there. Her labs came back with low kidney function and so the urgent care doc said she needed the ER. She has been very uncomfortable since she has been in there, obviously since they're not giving her the same dosage as she is used to to maintain, but but even when maintaining at home, she was in the same amount of pain. 

Cue tonight. All the nurses have been very friendly and have answered my questions with patience. I happened to be on the phone with my fiance when her nurse walked in, and I was trying to calm her down cause she was breathing to quickly, and they're thinking the bacteria caused a bit of pnuemonia.

While I was on my fiance's cell phone she had me on speaker phone, and the nurse walked in to change her fluids, and I was calming her down and trying to comfort her, and all of a sudden the nurse says hey let me talk to whoever that is and takes the phone and says

 ""I'm gonna be honest with you. She's a junkie and she's coming off dope.. that is why she is so uncomfortable. She failed her drug test for benzos and opiates, (both things that were prescribed to her up until a couple months ago when she stopped going to the doctor during this covid thing, although not the ROA that she chose) and she's in withdrawals. That's why she is so uncomfortable. And I'm telling you this because my husband died of it, and I'm 5 years sober myself. I was a nurse that got caught and had to go through a 2 year drug court/probation period. So she is going through hell right now, but she brought this all on herself.. this infection is more than likely a result of her drug use  (which I was not told at anytime even though the doctors were aware of her being an IV user, they were leaning towards the tick, or the tick bite allowing something in, and EVEN IF IT WAS I don't believe that's relevant to her immediate treatment""

She continued "" she's a junkie and she's going through hell right now coming off her dope and that's why she's going through so much pain, and so I don't feel bad for her, I've been there and I got through it on my own, but she did this to herself by shooting up whatever she could get in front of her and she is really sick and is lucky to be alive. So you can try to calm her down all you want but she's a junkie she's detoxing and this is the best thing for her is her to just lay here and get it out of her system. I'm not compassionate to other drugs users and she's lucky she got a doctor that is that is actually giving her Ativan and 2mg of morphine cause if it were me, I wouldn't have. She's  a junkie so the best thing you can do is leave her here to detox and get this stuff out of her system cause she clearly uses a lot and she just wants to get high so she's lucky to be alive but I'm not gonna be rainbows and Sunshine's to her because i dont feel bad for her cause she is just a drug addict."" 

So I said wow well can you put her back on the phone please, and my fiance was hysterical and felt degraded and what that nurse did was inhumane in the condition that she is in right now.. the nurse said ""they did an echo to look for endocarditis and didnt see any, but she said so they wanna do a TEE and echo the back of the heart to look for vegetations, and if that's the case than she will be in the hospital for 3-6 months and nobody will see her because of the visitor policy and and it won't be anyone's fault but this girl right here. She has a bad problem and all the pain is from the drugs so I don't feel for her""

I told her even when she was using, the pain was still this bad and she was making the same moans and groans before she even came to ER and got admitted, and she had used during all the days prior and was still in this amount of pain because she has abscesses inside of her hip that are not external, right under the tick bit.

I feel like this was totally uncalled for, first off, I called my fiance to talk to HER. I DIDNT call the nurse to talk to her, I just happened to call my fiance's PERSONAL CELL PHONE and when the nurse came in to change her fluids she just jumped in our conversation and started berating my fiance TO ME and embarrassing the SHIT out of her to me without even knowing who it was that she had on my fiance's phone .. I didn't provide a privacy code, and have never talked to this nurse before so it's not like she knew who I was, and she just started rattling off to me EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FIANCE andbhabout how her husband OD'd and she was a junkie to and so when she sees people like this she doesnt try to comfort them because she knows what she was like when she was a junkie. Then starts telling me her brother came back from Afghanistan and is shooting heroin in his neck blah blah....

Long story short, my girlfriend is in really bad shape with this infection, NO MATTER WHAT THE REASON IS I don't believe ANY of that was necessary for several reasons.

1. She has no idea who she was telling about my fiance's PERSONAL life and medical situation. I didn't introduce myself, I simply called my fiance to talk and this girl takes the phone and says go head and close your eyes if you want to rest, I'll talk to him. 

2. My fiance has never denied her drug use during her hospital visit, she has track marks for gods sake and has been honest about everything she uses. And NO ONE has treated her like that, MOST have actually given her info on how to get help, where to go for a needle exchange, and how to try to be as clean as possible. This nurse BERATED AND PHYSICALLY abused and humiliated my fiance to whoever she thought was on the other line, (thank God it was me) and especially with this no visitor policy, she is going through all this by herself and is very confused because of the dehydration, and infection. 

3. Is this anywhere near acceptable? My fiance was hysterical in the background, and it all started because she asked if it was time for her medicine yet, and the nurse went on a rampage about how no its not, you only want it cause you're an addict and that's not happening you'll get it as needed and that's when she got on the phone with me and said I'm gonna be honest with you, blah blah blah.

This was devastating as my fiance is already confused and isn't 100% there during all of this whether it be from the withdrawals or from the infection, but for this nurse to just DOG her and humilitate her RIGHT in front of her face while she is already in VERY BAD CONDITION, to whoever happened to be on the other side of that phone (THANK GOD it happened to be me and not someone else) without asking for a privacy code, without asking who I was, just rattling off all her personal business and deameaning the FUCK out of her all while she lay hysterical in the background. 

Is there anything I can do? She can do? I don't want this nurse ANYWHERE near my fiance EVER again, and i also believe she violated her patient confidentially and violated her basic human rights to be treated humane like a decent human being especially while she lay there ALONE scared and VERY sick BESIDES the withdrawals which is the least of it because she was sick even in the days before WHILE using. 

Please.. someone help me.. I'm so hurt for her. I get it. But I don't believe this nurse who knows nothing about her personal situation, had the right to do what she did, and I also believe there has to be something that can be done.  She was so embarrassed, and scared and hysterical in the background while this nurse dogged her to me on MY FIANCES CELL PHONE!!!!!! I literally am fuming. Please help give me some guidance here whether this was just a shitty human being, or whether she was out of line and/or violated any of my fiance's rights as a human AND AS A PATIENT. AT THE LEAST I don't ever want that nurse in that room again. Ever. But I feel this goes further. 

Sorry for the long read, but I'm fuming right now. I'm literally FUMING. Please help. 

Sorry to if it was a ramble, this has all be very hard, and this did not make it better for anyone for a nurse to make my fiance feel like a giant piece of shit while she is grasping for her life trying to recover.

EDIT: IN CASE IT WASNT MADE CLEAR. SHE HAS AN INTERNAL ABSCESS UNDERNEATH A KNOWN TICK BITE LOCATION ON HER REAR PELVIC. 

Why is it all you ""recovered addicts"" want to be holier than thou all of a sudden? I'm sure you weren't that way when you were dependant on your drug of choice? Here's the problem let's get it clear. If you don't want to take care of people, whether it be drug addicts, obesity, mental illness, etc... don't become a nurse. Cause that half broken pedestal your preaching from is broken. ANYONE can become an addict with the right injury and the wrong doctor. ANYONE. IF YOU WANT TO JUDGE PEOPLE AND PREY ON THE WEAK, AND Maybe just maybe, if you  DON'T WANNA TREAT DRUG ADDICTS DONT WORK IN A HOSPITAL"
"How can I protect myself from a lawsuit when selling climbing holds. I'm looking into creating climbing holds for myself. If I do this ill have many reusable molds to create duplicate climbing holds. I figure I can use these molds to create/sell custom climbing holds online. These holds would be made out of very durable material, more than capable of holding the weight of a person, however, there is always a very tiny chance they can break. Obviously these holds would be created knowing people will be hanging on them and they would be built to withstand that.

If someone were to buy my hold, have it break on them, and get injured, can they sue me? If so how can I protect myself against this."

"Green Card Spouse Question Hello, I have a unique enough situation that I haven't been able to find good resources for it online. My wife is a green card holder in the United States and was before we married (she's been a resident for about 12 years or so). We married back in December after dating 3 years, and then moved out of country. She hasn't gotten her citizenship, although she has qualified. We intend to be out of country for at least a year, but may return after a year, or longer. Will she qualify for a Returning Resident Visa if we return? What about when we visit family once every so often, will she need to obtain a VISA where she didn't have to before?"

[OH] Vet won’t provide copy of pet’s prescription My pet takes daily medication as prescribed by his veterinarian. This medication is also one that is commonly prescribed to humans so the pills are available at normal pharmacies too. I would like to have his prescription filled by a local pharmacy instead of having to drive to the vet to pick it up every month. My biggest problem is that the vet office charges WAY more than the normal rate- approximately 15x more for the medication than if I were to have the exact same prescription filled at CVS/Walgreens etc. I’ve asked multiple times for a copy of the prescription and they always have an excuse not to give me one. I am going to make one more attempt to get a copy but if they refuse again do I have any options besides finding a new vet? I’d like to know my rights before talking to them again.
"Car towed because it was 'abandoned' during Covid-19 My brother is a university student in Austin. He has not left his house since school has gone digital.The car my brother uses is under my mother's name. 

Yesterday she received a letter in the mail from a towing company informing her that on April 18 his car was towed from the parking lot of his apartment complex. They said it was abandoned and that as a warning, they had put a ticket on the car days before it was towed. My brother had NO idea that any of this happened. 

The towing company said that they sent the letter within 24 hours from when the car was towed. 
The letter has no date in it. There is no date on the envelope either. I find it hard to believe that is true. I think they waited to notify so that the fees go up. 

Is there any kind of regulation because of Covid-19 that would help my mom and brother?

Also, I know the tags are up-to-date on the car. 
The car has been in Austin Texas

"I've been getting free internet since i moved to a new house, am I liable to owe for the previous months? Since I moved into a new house I have been getting free internet from a popular ISP in our area. I had informed them that I was moving and they told me just to call to activate the service at the new address with the same old equipment. 

It took a few months but I finally moved and when I called the customer service rep told me that it was impossible to use the same old equipment and I would have to setup an entirely new account with new equipment. I was frustrated so I decided just to try hooking up the old equipment and to my surprise it worked fine. I haven't heard anything from the ISP nor have I been billed in nearly a year. 

I am located in Tennessee-US 

I have been thinking about upgrading my internet plan but I am worried that they will try to retro bill me for all of the previous months. Should I be concerned?"

"Denied foodshare appeal, need help with rehearing Location, WI, USA

&amp;#x200B;

So I thought this should have been pretty easy to do myself. I receive food share and use CBD products occasionally. I had to go in and take a drug screen. it came back 29ng/20ng cutoff. They denied me for 12 months for positive test. I still have the original cbd products and receipt from the store. told them that over our interview and explained if it was real weed the thc ng levels would be far far higher, in the 100's or 1000's.  This was their main response after 30 days:

"" The petitioner could be correct. Some CBD products have small amounts of THC that could result in a positive drug test. Some CBD products have no THC. However the Petitioner's testimony alone is insufficient to rebut the agency's evidence of a positive test. The agency worker and I are required to apply the law which requires a sanction of 12 months for a positive test unless evidence in the form of a physician or pharmacy statement explaining the positive test was presented""

I have 20 days to file for a rehearing but have to have evidence to send it on why they were wrong. Does anyone have any ideas where or how I could get a short letter or something from a phsysician or pharmacy that knows wtf they are talking about that could email/mail me a letterhead to forward for my evidence. I can provide copies of  the drug screen they sent that shows all the numbers and the 29/20ng level, plus all the cbd products and their lab reports still... this just is infuriating I'm possibly losing a years worth of food assistance during the worst time for using legal store bought products."
"UK: Student landlord won’t let me off contract but has let 2 of my flatmate’s off. Hi there, 

Bit of background information I’m studying at a British University and I live in a 6 bedroom house that’s privately owned, however all communication goes through the property management company I pay rent to.

I moved home at the start of lockdown (as did many other students) due to my uni being cancelled and the work moving online.

2 of my flatmates flew back to Italy a few weeks into lockdown while my other 3 flatmates continue to live in the house.

I emailed my landlord 5 days ago asking if I can get an early release from my lease as I am no longer living there and struggling with money due to being fired from my job due to COVID cutbacks and that I can take my stuff as soon as I’m allowed to.

I received a reply the next day telling me that rent is still required and if I need financial support, go to my guarantors. Fair enough, that’s what I expected.


However, I received an email from the company we pay our bills to informing us that the two Italians no longer are paying bills as they’ve provided proof of being let off the tenancy  and this shouldn’t affect us in any way (meaning I still pay my flat rate of £40 a month).


From asking one of the girls that left to Italy, she informed me the landlord has said providing she’s taken all her belongings he will cut the rent by a half.

Now where do I stand now? 

Can I hold this against them to get myself released from the lease? 

Any tips/ info is greatly appreciated.

Cheers all"

"HR to enroll me into insurance during a covid-19 free enrollment period and then forgot to email me back for a month just to get the finger I can’t even believe someone could be so bad at there job that I’m here asking this. 

Last year I started working for a new company. They had me enroll online before the first of the year for health insurance that would kick in after my 90 days. Easy enough. Come my 90 days I only saw vision insurance on my pay stubs. I don’t even need glasses, but the insurance was free. So I wanted and kinda forgot about asking. 

Then the cover-19 pandemic started and it was made aware to everyone that during a week window we could enroll for health insurance. Then I remembered I never saw health insurance mentioned on my checks. Then 3 days before the period was over I emailed HR to make sure I was enrolled. If not before, I would be now.

Sense that email ruffly half of the construction workers I work beside chose to take a leave of absence during the entire pandemic. I’m young so I kept working. My state had a stay at home order, but we where considered “essential.” Still a bit risky because we travel to customers homes to do improvements. 1 family even recently traveled by plane 2 days before we got to their home.

Flash forward to today where it’s over a month from my email to HR. They said, sorry. You can’t enrollment until November, but we can let you contact them yourself to apply on your own. 

Hold on. I’ve tried to apply twice during your deadlines. It shouldn’t be my responsibility for you to fill out your part of the paperwork. This entire time I’ve been at risk of working and had the opportunity not to work and make more on unemployment, and you can’t even make sure I have my health insurance? Wtf. Obviously I’m not sick yet, but if something where to happen anytime throughout this year shouldn’t they be liable for failing to provide the coverage they promised I would get? 

Just so mad and disappointed at the same time.
P.s. I’m located in Wisconsin"

"Families First Funds Being Used by Employer Hey all, realized I posted this in the wrong subreddit so this is a repost.

The nonprofit employer that I work for provides housing as a benefit of employment, and charges rent directly out of our paychecks.

Because of this, our organization has been essentially using our families first emergency paid sick leave to fund their operation, taking it from our pockets and putting it into theirs. It’ll be the same thing with their PPP loan, over 50% of expenses on payroll (in some cases) will be recouped as rent.

Truck had a new engine put in 6 yrs ago and currently has 72,000 miles on it (truck odometer shows 221K, new suspension work was done in Feb. 2019, and a new transmission was put in in Nov. 2019 and has about 5,000 miles on it.

The insurance company is not comparing my 72k miles, they are using the odometer reading..... I confronted them about it and they said frame/under carriage/and suspension is true age and mileage did not matter...

"Attempted Assault with a deadly weapon? So about an hour ago, I got home, and a car pulled up behind me and just stopped. Not really sure why. I thought maybe he thought he knew me. So I stick my hand up like...what?

There is no prior quareel, don't know the guy. He seemed young and pseudo-tough, not drunk or high.

So I call the police, the come out and call me, essentially not really giving a shit, basically telling me ok, we're not going to do aynthing.

This was only verbal communication and not with the manager. I stopped by again on the 4th (60 days prior) to attempt to speak with the manager. The same person was there and confirmed that he had made a note of my verbal notice to move out but that I could email the manager to confirm. I sent her an email the next day - December 5th.

I forwarded the email to the corporate agent and he has now sent a new bill for $2170 -$68 rent 2/1 to 2/1$137 rent 2/2 to 2/3$1698 reletting fee

$167 utilities 11/21-2/1

$75 cleaning$23 interest accrued

I realized that the only written documentation I have is the email sent on December 5th, but it seems a  bit unfair to charge me the reletting fee after multiple verbal confirmations and speaking with the leasing manger.

Is there anything I can do or am I out of luck?

TLDR:moved out after giving verbal notice 60 days ahead of timeemail sent 59 days ahead of timeleasing office said everything was okayreceived a big bill from corporate saying that i gave no noticeexplained situation and sent them the emailreceived new bill with a large reletting fee"
"Service provided but not requested Hi am in Utah if it helps

I have a guy who offered to mow/clean up my yard for a set rate that we agreed to and was done a month or more ago. Today he showed up unannounced (see him on my doorbell camera) and started to do yard work I didn't ask him to do.

I normally don't mind paying someone to do this but I didn't ask for it to happen either. Am I liable to pay even though I have had no communication with him to tell him to or not to?"
"Background Check in Indiana Ok so like my title says I have a question regarding my pending background check on a new job offer I just accepted here in Indiana. 

So basically my job prior to the one I have currently I resigned due to failing a drug screen after getting into an accident in a work vehicle. I was never under the influence on the job, but I failed due to my use outside of work. So now I’m just curious if this will pop up on the background check for my potential upcoming job. 

Any and all help is appreciated!!

Edit: (added info) I should also mention that it did not come up in my background check for my current job, or if it didn’t it didn’t factor into the hiring. The new job is potentially life changing for me and I’m just anxious to know if that can bite me in the butt."
"Can my brother get a gun without family approval? So I live in Vermont and my brother wants to consealed  carry a handgun. He is 16 and Does not have any parental permission. I have mentioned that he may need to have parental permission to do so because of his age, so he said that he will get one when he is 18 and we will never know about it. Is it legal for him to carry a gun on property where he has been explicitly told he may not and he does not pay taxes for? If it is legal, what can I do to stop him from getting one. No one in our family feels safe around it and there is a controversy with our neighbors who have consedered divorce if when they heard about this(there is a longer story behind this but I can't remember it fully). I have told him explicitly that I do not feel comfortable with it and he always replies ""you won't know about it so it won't matter"". Help! Im only 14 so I can't move out but I don't feel safe around guns.

"(IL) not furloughed (zero hours), wages paid on last month's hours. Can I still certify unemployment?

"My mom is living with my older brother who she just discovered is doing drugs, potentially heavy drugs. What can she do? My family situation is not particularly great, and at the root of it is my 25 year old brother. My parents are divorced and when each of us turned 18, he decided to live with my dad and I decided to live with my mom. After wearing down my dad, with what my dad tells me was lies and overstaying his welcome, my dad told him to find a new place to stay at the age of 23. My brother then decided to move in with my mom and me, much to my dismay as he has constantly displayed signs of being a sociopath, through his manipulations, lies, and verbal abuse that has been constant from a young age. I chose to leave my mother's household less than a year after as I couldn't handle how he treated me and my mom. My mom didn't see anything wrong with his actions as she hasn't seen my brother for about 5 years, anything he did wrong didn't matter because he was her son, even if it was driving me away.

Jump to now, I'm living on my own, and my mom calls me to tell me that she has found a large amount of evidence that my brother is doing drugs. She found what I can assume is a weed pipe from how she described it, he also has been smoking at night as he cracks his bedroom window open after 11 to what she assumes is to smoke. She found out that my brother's ""friend"" who comes over has been injecting himself some sort of substance while at her house, which lead her to kick him out. She tells me that he has been acting erratic lately, he says that his jumping off the walls behavior is due to anxiety. She basically has every reason to believe that he's doing drugs besides the smoking gun, which is the drugs that he is using. She told me that due to the quarantine the help lines tell her that there isn't much she could due because the court systems are closed. She wants him out of the house but with what she was told she doesn't know what to do about it.

"So I don’t know how to tag this but my ex all the sudden out of the blue contacts me and is threatening to take my cat Throwaway because I don’t want anyone who actually follows me who I know irl to get involved with personal matters or try and talk to me about it at a bad time.

Michigan, United States

As of Christmas Eve I had separated from my ex fiancé for gaslighting and being actually mad that I spent time in a hospital dying instead of coming to visit and be there for me. The lease on the apartment and all the bills have been a pain in the ass for me because she didn’t want anything to happen but I had to get away from the toxicity. We “agreed” that I would take her cat because she wouldn’t be able to care for it where she was moving to but in reality she put me in a situation where I couldn’t not take the cat. I gladly took her cat because I love him with all my heart and I would hate to see him go into a home with people he wasn’t comfortable with. I took a huge burden financially trying to get him moved in and he suffers from some very serious separation anxiety. She abused and mistreated this cat and he’s been so much happier since she dumped him on me. Just today she contacted me and tells me that she is coming back to get the cat. I told her through back and forth conversation that I was keeping the cat. She tried contacting my family and myself multiple times after I told her I wasn’t going to let her just barge in and take what she just left behind. Long story short I told her that if she kept trying to contact myself or my family on the matter I would be contacting an attorney. It’s been quite since. What are my steps now to prepare in case she tries to contact me or my family anymore? What do I need to do to make sure this cat is safe? What do I do if she comes to my parents house searching for me or the cat despite not being welcome there? Currently the cat is in custody of a trusted friend until I can move into my new home and I’ve been couch surfing between a couple friends and my current girlfriend and nobody really knows where I am at any given moment, does this effect anything at all? If there’s any more needed information I’d gladly give it because I don’t even know where to start."
"I Have A Question About a Warrenty And My Rights Hi, I know this isnt the most exciting subject, but any help would be apprecitaed. I purchased a fan, or an air circulator as they claim 2 years ago after another one i had finailly broke after 18yrs, i tried to get parts for the old one as it was so good, and i found out it was no longer made, but it had a lifetime warrenty, the company offered be a discount of approx $80, and i paid the remaining almost $200. (i know, but it reallly is a great fan!) so after 2 years it stopped working, i called several times during the week but they were closed-im not positive, but i think they said due to the virus (they claim thats not true) and said i disasembled it voiding the warrenty, i removed 2 screws, and could see the issue, the power wires had shorted out. thats was their 1st attempt to void te warrenty, i claimed that was illegal.

&amp;#x200B;

their next attempt was the inteneded use of the product, it is intened to be used in the US and Canada Only, i live in mexico, mexico uses the same power as the US, there is no modifications and they operate in 12 countries but not mexico.

they no longer offer a lifetime warrenty, but my product has a 10yr warrenty, and that is a major selling point.

do i have any recourse."
"[VA] Employer laid me off, didn't pay out PTO even though it's company policy. Hey Legal Advice i'm hoping to get a little help with this.

Back on March 25th my employer furloughed all of us due to COVID19 with the intention of bringing everyone back by May 1st, fast forward to April 24th and I was laid off completely with no promise of being brought back (understandable). I asked about what would happen with my PTO (80 hours and \~$1400 worth) and they said ""Virginia law doesn't require that it be paid out"" which is true, however based on my research if it's company policy it should be paid out.

At the time I forgot that in the company handbook that I signed it says: 

&gt;If an employee has unused PTO when their employment ends, the outstanding PTO will be paid out in their final pay check

As far as I know I never signed an updated company handbook and the policy was still the same when I left. So on April 28th I reached out and said:

&gt;Hey &lt;insert name here&gt; I know that Virginia doesn't require paying out PTO upon separation, but I was looking at my employee handbook and noticed that in it the company policy does pay it out upon separation and I was wondering if that was something we could discuss?

I haven't heard anything back and am wondering what my next best steps are to get it paid out. The company is an LLC and is rather small now with the layoffs (under 10 people) but is owned by a larger company.

"Renting Longterm AirBNB within Houston Apartment Complex I am looking for advice about what I should do in a weird situation.

I am currently renting a longterm AirBNB on a week to week basis in Houston Texas. The Apartment isn't spectacular but it is close to the hospital my Fiance is working at.

EDIT: AirBNB isn't involved because we worked it out off the site for week to week payments. I am just trying to ensure the entire scope is understood

Today the management came to ask us to vacate the property because the lease holder hasn't paid rent. I contacted the lease holder and they told me not to worry about it and that they couldn't kick us out. The management said they would come every day and knock until someone answered to ensure that we hadn't left the property. I can't have them coming to pound obnoxiously on the door and windows every day because she is working nights and it wakes her up. I happened to be in the bathroom when they showed up today and they didn't stop until I was able to make it there. I have made it clear that it isn't my problem to pay the rent to them and that we wouldn't be leaving unless there was an official eviction notice. The person got real bitchy and said okay well I will be back every day to make sure you are still here. I told her I will be here until it is resolved one way or another and that I do not want her to harrass us that way because it disturbs her ability to sleep and explained she is working nights. She said I don't care I will be here every day and it doesn't matter who I wake up. She litterally pounded on the window above my sleeping fiance's head.

1. Should I stop paying rent to the AirBNB manager? (We are not going through AirBNB, we are doing it off the site)
2. Should I find a different place to rent for the next two weeks that we are here?
3. Can I file some sort of harassment charge or something to get them to stop being obnoxious. I can't fix the problem, they know that and they know what the right way to handle the situation is but they are choosing not to.

Edit/Update: The person we have been paying told us that they wont be taking care of the rent so I am going to start looking for something else. "

Said they would sign a promissory note guarantees they will pay us and are not doing so bc they “don’t feel like it” won’t sit down and have a face to face conversation. Taking to them both separately we are given different information. Won’t show any bank statements. Our lease is up in a week.

I worked for most of 2017 and into 2018 at a business (in Florida) who's policies were sketchy at best. I left early 2018 and moved to a different city, and when tax season came I called them and requested they hold my W-2 so I could pick it up. When I went in to get it, they told me they had mailed it already, and I asked them to print me another one. I argued with them over text and phone calls, asking them to get me my W-2 and they never got it for me. I didn't file taxes in 2018 since I couldn't get it, and now that tax season has come around I went in, spoke to the manager and told them I wasn't leaving without it. The manager went into the back and when she came out she said she went through all the records dating back to 2016 and that my name doesn't show up anywhere in the systems. That makes me really nervous, I was getting paper checks from them because when I started I was told their direct deposit ""wasn't working"". I'm unsure how to proceed from here, or what me not being in their systems means for my taxes."
"While I was enrolled at my current school a few years ago, a teacher assaulted me by slamming me against the floor. If I said anything about it they threatened to expel me. Is that legal? I go to a special l education school in the north east United States. During my first year, I was in 7th grade. We ended up playing capture the flag as a sports option. While playing I ran out of bounds, grumbled, and ran into the jail. The kid who was chasing me said “hey you ran out!” 
I snapped back at him saying, “what are you stupid? I’m in the jail.” Enter Neil (Not his actual name) he send me out of the game, and let’s me sit for 10-20 minutes. After that time he comes over and tells me that I need to sincerely apologize to the kid I yelled at. I said “sure” and we walked over to him. Neil then yelled halfway across the field, “Paul! Locke is going to apologize for his behavior!” Then I said “can you not announce it to the entire field?” He then snaps at me and sends me to the counseling area. Basically the time out corner renamed for less embarrassment. I say “what? I didn’t do anything!” And refuse to leave. He then stops the whole game, rounds everybody up into a circle points at me, and says “Locke is the one holding you up, if he goes inside we can start playing again.” I still refuse, and he then makes everyone pack of the boundaries, flags and water jug to move inside. I help, grabbing some cones, and head inside. As I go to walk into the gym, Neil blocks the door. He grabs the cones out of my hand and puts them on a nearby table. I say “excuse me, you’re blocking my way.” He says “I told you to go into the C.A.” I try to get around him, and he then grabs me, spins me around, pins my arm behind my back, and throws me face first onto the ground. Being a child and just being attacked I started freaking out, the principal was called, and it was a whole mess. His story was that I ran into him, spun around and fell without him touching me. Even though there were witnesses that said otherwise. Throughout the rest of the year, Neil was constantly on my case, barking for me to go to the C.A. At the slightest provocation. It came to a head when he yelled at me to go to the C.A. And I yelled back “or what? Are you going to throw me on the ground again?” A meeting was called with administration staff about my enrollment. I was told if I kept mentioning the incident, I would most likely be expelled. So, I shut my mouth. I was scared, I liked the school but I didn’t like Neil. My mom was really upset and she hammered it into me that I couldn’t lose enrollment in this school, so I couldn’t mention it again. I currently a junior at the same school, so I doubt I could even do anything about it. But is threatening expulsion for talking about a staff assaulting you even legal. Hell, was he in the right? Maybe he thought I was acting aggressively? There aren’t any cameras in my school, so no footage. I don’t know. Feel free to chime in."

"Bank charging multiple overdraft fees for money that keeps getting taken out then put back into my account (RESOLVED! Got back 90% of the money)

Live in the US if that helps)

Hi, first time post here

I do my banking with TD Bank and during the month of April I miscalculated when my paycheck was coming and went into overdraft.

That’s fine, my mistake and for the money I spent I understand those charges come with the fee. 

However, I had five Venmo transactions where the money was repeatedly taken out then denied by my bank and put back.

Each time I was charged an OD fee which was never put back. It ended up equaling to over $500 in charges. Five times over what I paid Venmo in the first place.

I’m furious and called the bank asking why they allowed the charges to go through only to deny them and keep charging me fees for the same money that was ultimately never taken out.

The employee tells me they can only reverse two as a “curtesy”. I say I know that’s not true as every time I have returned an item that has put me into OD in the past the fee was also put back.

Suddenly, it then turns into “well your account won’t allow that”.

We go in circles and I ask if I can talk to someone who does know why my account won’t allow that, and apparently there’s no one higher than her in the building due to COVID. 

I said I understand but would like to at least email someone in management then. She tells me it’s not possible. Refuses to give me any way to contact someone higher up.

Magically she’s able to speak to an “ambassador” though. I ask if I can speak to them, she tells me no. Half hour on the phone and they’re still refusing. At that point I hung up before I lost my temper. 

I guess what I want to know is if there’s any way to take this further and find a way to contact someone higher up and fight this. It’s a lot of money and my fiancé and I are both furloughed for the next couple of months. 

I’m also angry because I know it’s a blatant lie that there’s no one above her that I can speak to. I hate confrontation and this whole thing has me upset.

I really appreciate any help. I guess I just want to know if it’s a lost cause or not. I apologize if this is the wrong place for this specific problem but I wasn’t sure where else to ask."

"Roommate moved out before lease is out. Can we keep their deposit to pay for the missed rent We live in a house of about four people who are contracted onto a lease that doesn't let out till July (end of June). One roommate said they were gonna move out a month early and we all agreed it would be ok for them to move out a month early. Then they decided to go behind our backs and get the security deposit back early so they could move out a month early, not paying for May or June. 

We didn't find out until they messaged us telling (btw there was NO communication about this, just a ""I'm moving out"" statement. No questions or regards to the rest of the tenants), that they were gonna move out early and not pay for May. 

This was a really annoying move because many of us are struggling from COVID-19 and this financial hit of rent raising unexpectedly was really frustrating. To top it off, they left garbage here that we had to take care of (big garbage!) Despite the fact that we told them to take it to a dump since it was too big for the trash people to take. They also left hair, rips in the walls from paintings, and their still moist towels in the bathroom. The remaining tenants have all decided we want to keep their part of the deposit to pay for the clean up we had to do and the rent they jumped out on.

Are we legally allowed to do this? All the money we pay goes to one guaranteed person so the rental people told us it was on the tenants to figure out the security deposit. 

TL;DR - roommate moved out early and left garbage for us to take care of and clean. Can we keep their security deposit to pay for the rent?"
"I don't feel safe with my live-in girlfriend anymore, yet we still have 6 months left in our lease. What are my options?

&amp;#x200B;

Her and I signed a year long lease in January. I don't believe I can 'kick her out' legally since she's on the lease as well. I've contacted the landlord regarding drafting a new lease solely in my name, but they haven't gotten back to me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do in this situation? Ideally, I'd like us to part ways amicably, with her leaving the property and I will continue to live here. She simply can't afford to live in this house on her own - as a matter of fact she hasn't paid me rent in...years.

I'm loathe to involve the police as I'm frankly terrified she would (falsely) accuse me of domestic abuse and essentially ruin my life.

"Amazon Partially Missing Package So I ordered a $700+ item from Amazon at the beginning of April. I got the package but the item was missing from the retail packaging. As in I had the packaging box and the retail box but no product inside. The product is a computer processor and weighs very little.

I reached out to Amazon and they did an investigation that came back with nothing. They told me to get a police report done so I did. They then wanted to verify that I filed the report before refunded my money, but because of COVID the records department was closed and I believe it is their policy not to provide info over the phone regarding police reports.

So then I disputed the charge with my credit company, but I just learned today that the temporary credit was charged back to me.

I know I can go to small claims court but I’m very intimidated by it and don’t know how to start a case for it. I’d like to avoid going to small claims if at all possible.

"Can a previous cat owner use the legal system to get their cat back after they abandoned it with my wife and I for the last 7 months? Sorry this is on mobile my wife is worried and it’s a rant but here is the situation.

My wife had A friend that she worked with whom got a kitten knowing that their apartment complex did not allow it but got it anyway and had to hide it from the landlord. Well push comes to shove her friends marriage was going through a rough patch to where the wife left with their kids out of state and the friend could not care for the cat because he was afraid he was going to get evicted because of it. So my wife offered to take the cat until he got a new place and originally he agreed to pay for all the food and board for the cat for the duration that we had her. That lasted one week and he only gave us $40. In the course of him trying to get his marriage back together he had a falling out with my wife and essentially their friendship ended they stopped talking and he never once inquired about the cat. Flash forward 7 months and the kitty has bonded with both of our cats has the freedom of the entire house and has accepted me as her human with head bumps hand licks lots of purrs night time snuggles and will not leave me alone when I’m in the room. This was quite the change from the original living conditions because her friend had young kids that would not treat the kitty nicely they both worked and was hardly home and since it wasn’t allowed they had to confine it to one room of the apartment. We feel that they have abandoned the cat with us and she’s a perfect fit for our other two cats so we don’t want to give her back anymore. They get their marriage back together about 3 months ago and not once ask about the cat. My wife gets a text 3 weeks ago asking about the cat but she ignores it since they are still in the same apartment. Last night my wife gets another late night text from her old friend stating that since we don’t want to give the cat back we basically stole the cat and they will try to use the legal system to get it back. My question is how can they do that and what can we do to prevent it?

If they go that route the only thing we can think of is figure out the cost of room and board for the last 7 months and bill them. I would rather not give the cat back because we feel she is better taken care of with us then them.  This is in Alaska"
"Can my car, in my father's name, stay on his policy once I move out of state? Hello!  I am moving out of state this summer and my car is currently under my father's name, on his car insurance policy.  We are doing it this way because it is considerably cheaper to add me onto his plan rather than me purchasing my own insurance, and I got my car when I was 17 so it is under his name and we never changed it.

We did some research and found that generally you have to get your own policy once you move.  Would there be any issue with me continuing to keep my car under his name and stay on his insurance? Would they somehow know that the person using the car is out of state?"
"Car Rental Company - Unfair practices Needed some help with a situation I am in, not sure whether this is the correct group but I will give it a try :) sorry for the long post, it is a little complicated! 

My dad rented a low-roof 8 seater van from a local car rental company (in B.C) Jul 2019. He signed the contract, got the keys, inspected the vehicle; but when he got in the van ready to leave to pick up our family that had landed at the airport, he was stopped and asked to take another vehicle. He waited for an 1.5 hrs for this other vehicle to arrive, at this point our family was extremely concerned since they didn't have a mode of communication to contact us. Once this new vehicle arrived, it was a high roof 8 seater van, that my dad was not comfortable driving, but they essentially forced him to take it. When he asked them to draw up a contract for it which includes damage protection for the roof + under carriage, the employees said they were too swamped and would take care of it later. It had been 2 hours at this point, so my dad asked them to draw up the contract again but it was going to take longer so he left to get my family.   


After a couple days of driving this vehicle, as my dad was pulling into a hotel, the roof of the hotel was extremely low and it damaged the top of this high roof vehicle. He immediately took it back to the car rental company and told them about the damage and the manager said that he had a friend who would get it fixed and we could settle this between us. We tried calling the manager to get updated repeatedly but received no word. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Jan 2020, my dad was out of the country in his home town on his pre-planned trip but was experiencing some health issues that he was dealing with when we received a 'Final Demand' Legal Notice from the head quarters of this rental company, demanding almost $16,500 for damages. They claimed we had ignored their previous letters (which we never got) so they had their paralegal send this final notice threatening to take us to court. Over e-mail communication, we kept giving them an update about my dad's health condition and his inability to deal with the issue when he wasn't in Canada but they kept pressurizing us and kept using threatening language. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we requested them to send over the documentation, they sent us an unsigned contract with paperwork that was evidently manipulated. Majority of the paperwork had mistakes &amp; wrong information -  for example: they have a damage estimate document from a local garage that they got the car fixed from dated Sept. 2019 but they have attached a final demand notice dated 3 days after the incident happened (Jul 2019) with the $16,500. They also have a damage waiver document with the information for the Low Roof van that we never even rented. 

&amp;#x200B;

So given this background, do we have a solid case against this company to fight them in small claims court. What kind of a lawyer should we consult? Has anyone had an experience like this? Would this fall under Unfair /  Deceptive practices in the Consumer Protection Act? Would appreciate any feedback :)"

"Dog tries to attack Amazon driver. Not sure if this is the right place. I'm not necessarily asking for legal advice, but asking if my situation can/will have legal repercussions. 

Anyways. I live with my mom, and she went out for a bite to eat. 

Our dog started barking. Big dog, Bull Mastiff. She barks at anything coming up the drive. I figured, ""Mom's back from getting some food."" Not wanting to pull myself away from what I was doing, and being sure it was my mom, I let her bark. 

But, she didn't let up. I knew something wasn't right. I ran to the door, and a delivery driver was holding the storm door shut with her foot. Dog was jumping on the door hard. I apologized profusely, but she wasn't having it. Understandably, she was pissed. 

The package wasn't mine, or my mother's,  so I had no notice of it coming. 

My question is this, could she sue for mental damages? File a police report for my dog trying to attack her? I'm sure she was terrified, and she was for sure mad. I feel like an absolute schmuck for reaching out to make sure she can't do anything about it. But, it's not my house, and I don't want my mother to get in any kind of trouble for my stupidity.  

She didn't get bit, so I don't think anything can be done, just want to cover all my bases. Thank you guys so much for any help you can offer."
"Employer withheld but did not pay unemployment insurance, possibly other taxes and has not provided a w2 I’m a 25 y/o preschool teacher in WA state USA. I worked full time at a small business from Feb-August 2019. In June of that year my employer had cash flow problems and there were 3 separate 2 week periods where we were not paid on time. Ultimately I did get paid and I quit after it seemed clear that she wasn’t getting any more responsible. 

During the time I worked for her I was paid in personal checks or cash a number of times and received pay stubs that had a breakdown of taxes withheld. I regret not questioning and pushing the situation more at the time but my boss was emotionally manipulative and it was a caring position so I was overworked and exhausted. 

I heard from former coworkers that the situation had improved a lot and that there had been no more pay gaps so, not very smart, I started working for her again part time in late Feb of this year until the pandemic started. I haven’t been into work since then. 

I applied for unemployment for my 2nd part time job (unrelated to the employer in question) and discovered that ESD had no record of my hours and wages from the employer in question, therefore I was entitled to very little compensation as my 2019 income outside of that job was very low. 

She has told me many times that she will provide my W2 and I have kept asking. I’ve asked her for an explanation about unemployment taxes and she hasn’t responded. I’m still hoping that there’s some other explanation and that I won’t have to go through with some remedy but that’s looking less likely. 

I’m looking for guidance about how to proceed with this and what the outcome may look like. Thanks for your time and whatever help you may be able to offer!"
"How can I get a copy of my parents passports? Passport record? For the past year I've been trying to obtain dual citizenship under jus sanguinis (I do qualify) and have been to every bureaucracy involved in this process in search of any type of exception and/or exemption because of my circumstances.

I have not been in contact with my family for years because of abuse. However, to proceed with my application, copies of both my parents passports are being required to verify my birth certificate with NO other alternatives available or allowed (I have asked multiple times in person, e-mail, and made phone calls to multiple different locations). Frustratingly enough, I've literally been told to ""contact and make up"" with my family despite my explanations of abuse nor did I think they would even provide the documentation I needed anyways.

Right now I am planning to apply for their [passport records](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/passport-records.html), unless it's just a waste of time and money? I tried Googling to see what kind of records people have gotten back, but nothing concrete comes up. It says records may include ""Passport Applications"" would that include a photocopy of their passport? I also don't qualify to receive their records from The Privacy Act (only authorized persons and parents of minor children do?), so will the records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act censor more important records/documents making it useless?

If not, does anyone know how of any other way I can possibly, and legally, obtain a copy of my parents passport?

I’m moving out and my mom’s super crazy so I wanna know just how badly she could screw me if she wanted So my mom kinda has a history of being a bit physically but even more so emotionally abusive and she still is to this day. So the reason I’m afraid to move out is because if I try to take my phone or laptop (which were gifted to me at Christmas) I’m afraid she’ll press some kinda charge like theft. Is there any way I could argue that they were gifted in court or will she even be able to do that in the first place? Also my bank account is under my dads control but he doesn’t like her anyways and they’re going to get divorced so should I be worried about her controlling that?

"Police going to arrest my mother, what do I do? State: FL

Age: 18

My mom just told me that on Sunday the police will come to our house and arrest my mom for something. I'm not entirely sure for what reason, but she said it's over custody issues with my younger brother and my former step-father. She said she's going to be leaving for a few days and that the police will come when she is gone. She told me to refuse to open the door when they come, but I feel like they'll come in and break the door.

It's only going to be me, I'll be home alone. She told me I have to record them or whatever but I know the police get mad when you record them. What do I do? I'm scared that they'll come and arrest me for not opening the door or for recording them. I'm in high school and I'm just trying to focus on my schools and extracurriculars.

When they come, what should I do? Should I just refuse to open the door and if they break it, then should I record them? Last time they came, my former step father came in and stole a bunch of stuff from us and they were completely on his side and refused to even talk with us about it.

"Does a bag brand notorious for carrying weed count as probable cause? Hi! I’m new to this subreddit so I’m sorry if formatting is incorrect.

I’d like to preface that I’ve never actually used marijuana, but I’m just curious because I’ve seen a lot of videos about dime bags going around. It’s a brand of bag that is “smell-proof” and is generally known for holding marijuana. I often see them posted with tag lines such as “know your 4th amendment rights” or “come back with a warrant.” 

But, say in a situation in which this bag is easily seen by a police officer (in a state where weed is illegal such as Missouri) and they know the bag itself is meant for carrying weed, can they search it? I’m not familiar with laws concerning the 4th amendment and I’m unsure of how probable cause plays into unreasonable searches and seizures. Can anyone explain? Thanks!"
"[DC] Landlord starting house-wide renovations June 1 I started renting a room in a house in DC on August 1, 2019 and signed a year-long lease that is up on July 31, 2020. My 3 roommates' leases are up as of June 1, 2020 and all had plans to move away. Until last Sunday, I was under the impression I would stay until August and renew a month-to-month lease and move out eventually. Also, that new roommates would move in in June to split the utilities and pick up a new internet plan since our current plan will end when one of the 3 roommates moves out.

On Sunday, May 3, my landlord emailed me that she wouldn't be renewing any leases (mine included) and that she would start major renovations on the house on June 1. She added that if I didn't want to live in the house during the renovations she'd let me off my lease on June 1 with no penalty. Now I have less than a month to find a new living situation in an expensive city and during a pandemic that is affecting the housing situation in dramatic ways.

I'm actively seeking a new lease elsewhere but I'm worried if I don't find something by June 1st, I'll have to put up with living in a messy, noisy house when I'm supposed to be working from home. Also, having random renovators coming in and out of the house for 2 months during a pandemic sounds like a great way to catch the virus - she hasn't hired professionals for any of her handywork so far.

I'm not sure if any laws or coronavirus-related mandates apply here but I'd greatly appreciate any advice. I've already written to her my concerns but I haven't heard back yet."
"Want to start a jewelry business online, but not sure what I can count as my brand [MI] Hi everyone!
not sure if this is the right sub but I thought I’d give it a shot. 

So I want to start handmaking jewelry then selling on Etsy, then hopefully create my own website in the future. 

For earrings, I plan on outsourcing the premade Swarovski charms and pendants from a wholesale jewelry supply website. Since this is already premade, I would just be assembling the earrings together with the fish hook wire. Can I still sell and advertise them as part of my own brand? I saw someone on Etsy selling earrings with the same charm that I was interested in using so I wasn’t sure if I can market this as my own.

"[CA] Ex owed me money, signed contract for it. No word from her about it, contract about to earn interest. What are my next steps? Edited for Visibility

Hello there, for a bit of context my then-significant-other drove my vehicle and got into an accident. I got an estimate of the repairs, of which they said they would pay me back. Nearly two years later, we break up.

Before moving (Still in California) I throw together a contract and have her sign it. Here's a paraphrase

&amp;#x200B;

* I, (Ex), agree to make whole the damages inflicted upon (OP) due to (Getting in a crash).
* It is agreed and understood by both parties that (Ex) will attempt to repair or replace (explicit damage) before (OP) leaves the city.
* If repairs cannot be made in time, (Ex) agrees to pay the sum estimate required for repairs, minus any amount (OP) owes (Ex).
* It is agreed that (Ex) will pay full amount by (DATE\_SOON) or else (5% Monthly Interest on principle and accrued interest)
* If (OP) Determines there is no good faith effort by (EX) to follow the contract, (OP) reserves right to claim whole amount owed, including interest and any costs applied in an attempt to reclaim amount owed.

This is signed and dated by both parties twice; Once at the origin of the contract, and a second time when I had given them a bit of cash, effectively making the amount they owed me more.

\----------

Dear reader,

They have made no steps to pay me, or to contact me about making payments, and (DATE\_SOON) is swiftly approaching. My goal is to get the amount owed to me so that I can actually make repairs on my vehicle. I am currently located in a different County then the other party. What are my options, and how should I proceed?"
"Received a copy of a form stating worker’s comp refusal to pay full amount of hospital bill. (EDIT: I am in NY)
My mother had a non-serious injury late October where she slipped and hit her head on a corner. It wasn’t anything bad, but her manager told her to go to a hospital and worker’s comp would take care of her. She was billed $1754 and we sent that over to the worker’s comp company (Sedgwick) and that was that. Today she received an envelope with a letter and a copy of a form. 

The letter states:


Dear HOSPITAL NAME,

Please see attached. 

Sincerely

The form’s heading is:

They paid $269.95 and says the amount in dispute is $1484.05.

So does my mother have to pay the remaining balance? Or is this just a courtesy letter from the company to tell us what’s going on?"
"Terminated/Fired for Contracting COVID-19 (Texas, North Dallas Area)  

Hello, I'll keep this direct and to the point.

A few weeks ago (I work in food service) I worked at a restaurant on March 28th all night. On March 29th I began to feel feverish and got an appointment to urgent care. I was tested, and let my employer know that I was showing symptoms of COVID-19 and was tested that evening - the results would take up to a week and I wouldn't feel comfortable coming back to work and exposing co-workers/customers until I knew the results. He said no problem and to keep him updated.

Two days later my family and I were all confirmed positive for COVID-19. I immediately notified my employer to let him know this, and that the health department in my county would be routinely checking up on me, but to expect that I would be out a minimum of 10-14 days before I would be allowed to leave self-quarantine per the County Health Department. Again I was told no problem and to get better.  

I contact my employer after i'm released from self-isolation and ask when i can come back to work and get no response. nothing and get no response for the next m We're now into May and after a few messages with the owner who initially said ""No problem we'd love to have you back"", is now saying that the staff and ownership is scared of working with me and that ""we'll see"" when I can come back (which I have no vacation/sick time so this is essentially being unemployed without any formal notice) since I was sick and then 0 communication.

I know as an American my rights are extremely limited but is there anything I can do in this situation? The job market is horrible right now and I don't have many options.

Thank you."
"Claiming Damages (not too serious) Hello,

"Bought a newer used car with clean carfax, 1 year later notice a small offset in front axle, bring it in to dealership and they find carfax showing an accident that happened before I bought it and say the frame is slightly bent. Can I do anything about this? Like title says, I noticed one wheel sticking out further on one side than the other (~1”), I took it in to see if it was under warranty, and then they said the frame was slightly bent and pulled the carfax that showed the vehicle in an accident 4 months prior to when I bought the vehicle. At the time of purchase, the carfax was clean and I didn’t notice the slight offset since the car drove normal (and still does). One thing that comes to mind is that the dealer who sold me the car most likely inspected it prior to selling it, which makes me think that the inspection saw the slightly bent frame but called it good enough to sell at normal price. The resale value decreases significantly due to frame damage, so am I completely screwed with my car having lost a significant amount of value out of my control? Is there anything I can actually do about this?"

"Seller hid foreclos​ure from us, revealed a week before closing during tit​le search-- what are our options? [NY] This is in New York State. I've changed details to protect identities, but the gist is the same. 

First time homebuyers. Back in February we found a decent house with a single owner that was within our price range (~$350k), but higher than we ideally wanted to go. We kept our eye on it, but continued our search. We eventually circled back to it, and by that point the price had come down to $328k. Quarantine orders started just before we made our initial offer of $313k, expecting the seller to counter us up to $320k, but to our surprise (and that of our realtor) the seller accepted without countering. We suspected it was due to the shift in market balance; a lot of people ended their searches for a house. We now suspect a different motivation.

Since that point, the seller has made life exceedingly difficult for us. The seller's realtor told me at an open house that he had obtained an expensive certificate we needed for an application with the house to save a lot of money-- turns out he didn't, and now it's required. He impeded our home inspection by initially not allowing us to inspect a sealed section of the house; we eventually were allowed to send a contractor out to install an access panel. He refused to repair any of the home inspection failings, even after we offered up to $750 as part of the contract to cover inspection-related repairs (as a show of good faith that we wouldn't nickel-and-dime him). He initially refused to sign the property inspection stating that the A​C-- which was too cold for our inspector to test-- would need to be in functional condition at closing, saying he's ""bitter about taking the low offer"" and ""not inclined to do us any favors.""

Fast forward to this week. After waiting weeks and weeks for the search and survey, well past when they were contractually due, the search revealed that the house had a judgme​nt of fore​closure less than a week before the house was listed for sale. On the contract, which all parties signed a month _after_ the foreclo​sure, the seller checked ""No"" to ""Co​urt Ord​ers"" and ""Fore​c​losure"" in the Sel​ler's Disc​lo​sures. I found a public record of the forecl​osure in county filings. I also found that there's a lawsuit of the bank vs the seller dated a couple months before the foreclo​sure. Boy, do I wish I made that search sooner.

Our attorney is still gathering details, but what we know is:

- The selling agent knew about the for​eclosure and reportedly included it on a listing page ""only available to agents""; she says she's ""100% confident"" it won't be an issue with the sale (uh, what?)
- Our agent didn't see it, and thus didn't bring it up
- The seller did not tell his real estate lawyer, who was equally shocked when he told ours
- All of the disclosures fail to mention the foreclos​ure
- Apparently one of the seller's attorneys-- not the one he has handling the sale-- has been trying to mitigate the fo​reclosur​e with Chase Bank, whatever that means. I guess they're trying to reach an agreement where he'd be allowed to sell it to us-- is that a thing?

We currently rent and have a lengthy lease remaining ahead of us, so we don't have to move anytime soon, but we were really excited about the house. We even bought thousands of dollars' worth of DIY tools and supplies to fix up the place ahead of closing so that we would be ready to get started right away-- we were so close that we didn't think anything quite as bad as this would happen, but I now see it was unwise. We're now surrounded by boxes with nowhere to go.

We've been asking what our recourse is, but we don't know whom to trust, because our attorney and realtor have a vested interest in us not backing out of the sale (they both get paid at closing). They keep telling us not to worry, let's just wait and see, blah blah blah. We've made it clear that we have one foot out the door at this point. We've had bad feelings about the seller from the get-go. However, we also aren't eager to re-enter the rat-race of the housing market once the stay-at-home orders lift. The house is generally in good shape and the inspection failures were minor. We would be happy to move forward if it didn't have a for​eclo​sure.

We feel cheated and angry. While the price we got for the house is arguably good, we also worry that the history of fo​reclosure will negatively impact the resale value of the house. We purposely avoided buying any forec​losed homes in our search, and likely would not have placed an offer in the first place had we known (or would have placed a much lower one). In order words, this information would have materially changed our decision. Now _we_ feel inclined to not do the _seller_ ""any favors."" How did the selling party think this would go, honestly?

Can we add an addendum to the contract lowering the purchase price another 5% and walk if he doesn't sign? Will our lender take issue with that? We're about ready to walk, anyway. If we don't buy the house, will he have to surrender it to the bank for auction? If that's the case, one would think we have leverage here. We certainly don't want to pay the same amount after the stress of this nonsense.

What are our options now, aside from walking or waiting? We have no clue what to do.

Thank you for reading.

Since the local mortuary would need to transfer her to another mortuary in NY, I'm serious concerned of her getting lost in the overwhelming situation there and reports of bodies being mistreated.

The second issue is she wanted to be buried with her mother, however other family members have since died. She can't be buried directly with her mother; only an adjoining plot.

Cremated remains can fit in the burial plot of her choice. Can I legally decide, as the listed executor, to have her cremated instead of interred so I can avoid the NY mortuary system, and give my mom her wish to be buried with her mother?"
"Two days into new job - description and duties drastically changed (AB, Canada) Hey, I'm just looking around to see what sort of recourse, if any, might be available.  

I just started a brand new job in a non profit agency working with vulnerable (homeless) people. 

I've done this type of work for several years, and I'm aware of the risks involved, but I'm only a few days in, but already seeing *massive* red flags with this company - some of which I won't discuss here. What I do want to ask about is the change in job description. 

The description and contract I signed indicated mostly working with external partners, minimal (but some) direct contact with clients. Within my first week of working, I was told that I would actually be working in a warehouse, sorting donations that are coming in.  My contract indicates that my regular working days would be Mon-Fri 9-5 with *some* availability for evenings and weekends, but I've now been told I will be working evenings and weekends on a regular basis. I was also told pretty directly that the reason I was hired under the original contract was because there is no funding provided for the warehouse/labour role I am now in. 

I don't want to get too 'in the weeds' with the details of the job, but I'm basically wondering if it's legal for an organization to hire me for a stated position, and then immediately change the duties. 

Thanks in advance."
"[CA] Moved out end of March. Still waiting on Security Deposit. Want to send demand letter during pandemic I moved out my old apartment at the end of March. As of today, I still have not received my security deposit. I have reached out to the property managers of the apartment complex several times with no luck and also tried emailing the corporate residential company

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline -

End of March - Moved Out.

April 27 - Left an email with my property managers. She said she will contact corporate. However, no response back.

April 28 - Went to corporate office's website and use their message form to send a message regarding my security deposit. Stated that I wanted to be contacted by email, but left my phone number on the message also. No answer on that end as of today.

April 29 - Contacted property managers. Property managers noted that the security deposited has apparently been mailed out on April 17 and I should wait another week before calling again to resend another check.

May 7 - Still no check. I reached out. Property managers state they will contact corporate office.

May 8 (today) - I reached out to the property manager and she stated that right after I got off the phone with her, she contacted corporate, but she was not able to get in contact. I also tried reaching out to the corporate office, tried calling the number on their website and it is directing me leave a voicemail on a mailbox that is full...

&amp;#x200B;

I know in California, landlords are required to send the security deposit within 21 days after moving out. At this point, am I obligated to the full security deposit? I know they stated that they mailed it out on April 17, but there is no proof of that because I never received the mail.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to send a demand letter by certified mail for the full security deposit (if possible, dependent on the above question), but wondering where I should send it to since it is stated by the property managers that everyone in the office is working from home due to the ongoing pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am doing all the steps I can atm. Anything else I should be doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!"
"Illegal Business taking up all parking One of our neighbors now runs an illegal mechanic shop right behind his garage. He had multiple cars out on the street which don’t belong to him. I would say I’m total he may have 8 outside. Today he even had a car towed and parked on the street.

"[TX]I applied for unemployment, but don’t need it. What do I do? When all of this covid stuff started I was told by my employer that they were not going to be able to pay us when we shut down. I immediately applied for unemployment the last day we were open, and was approved a week or so after. 

The week after we closed I received an email that my pay would be covered for two weeks as an “emergency pay”. I did not claim unemployment during this time because I still received full pay. 

About a week or two after that I am informed that the next 4 paychecks (until the end of this month) are covered and I will be receiving pay. I have during this whole time not claimed any unemployment money. 

My job is scheduled to open back up the 19th of this month, so I will not be needing the unemployment at all. 

Do I need to contact someone? 
Is there anything on my part that needs to be done? 
I am worried if there is a second closure and I do not receive pay that I will be unable to receive unemployment because of the time I have been accepted, even though I have not made a claim.

"My grandparents aren't receiving their stimulus checks at the same time, taxes weren't filed This is Minnesota and I'm sorry about My grammar/mistakes. Hopefully this is the right place for this, help me if im lost! 

My grandparents have been together 45 years &amp; have always filed taxes together. Over the last few years they've gotten later on taxes &amp; the last two tears they just haven't filed. Grandpa is retired for almost a decade &amp; gramma is currently unemployed due to covid. 

Well my grandpa received his $1200 check and my grandmother has not. I checked online with her for the status of her check and it gave us the "" PAYMENT STATUS IS NOT AVAILABLE"" notice. I figured it was due to her not filing taxes? How could he receive it and she not if they have to file together? 

My grandpa has always been the one filing taxes and only does it himself. There is a dated deposit of $1200 in a joint account between them, and every bank account they have is joint between them in a trust. 

Would it be possible to file separate taxes without the knowledge or mutual decision of both parties? 

It it possible to recieve the stimulus check without filing taxes or submitting a ""non-filer""?

Is something off here, maybe not illegal but confusing."

"Question about Applicability of WARN Act/Definition of Mass Layoff This is in the United States, state is Delaware, but I believe Federal Law applies as it is the WARN Act I am specifically asking about.

I work for a well-known corporation at one of their manufacturing sites. As of the middle of March, the Site employed 298 people. Layoffs were announced and they ended up permanently cutting 65 hourly and 15 salary jobs. These layoffs were completed in April. This past Monday, they announced they would be doing another round of permanent layoffs, which we hear will take place in the next couple of weeks. We do not yet know how many will be affected but the group thought number is probably another 60-75 people. 

My question is: From what I have read about the WARN Act, a mass layoff is defined as an employer of 100 or more persons laying off 33% or greater of those persons. What I haven't seen is if that 33% cut has to be in one fell swoop, or if the cumulative number from several layoffs in relatively close proximity can trigger it, as long as the total cuts equals 33% or greater.

The people that got laid off the first round were paid for two weeks, given four weeks severance, and their health insurance paid for 12 months. My feeling is they company did that to avoid any claims and they probably made the people sign something waiving any future claims in order to get those benefits. I am very close to securing a new job that I will be able to start as soon as I am laid off so I will not need 12 months of health insurance. As the new job will be a fairly significant pay drop, I would much rather have the 60 days pay the WARN Act stipulates must be paid if the company fails to provide 60 days notice.

The other question is if one of the three exceptions to the WARN Act applies. The company, while frequently in the news for its struggles recently, is not is such dire straights that it could reasonably be considered a ""Faltering Company"". I don't think they could successfully argue natural disaster, either. The plant is still operational and we are still making products, albeit at a significantly lower volume. The only one they maybe could argue is unforseen business circumstances due to COVID-19, but the industry we primarily supply was already rapidly declining more than 60 days ago.

Thanks for any help."

"Divorce in Oregon I finally decided to file for divorce last week and my case got approved yesterday, but I’m so confused about what are the next steps. I didn’t take an attorney because I can’t afford one and I don’t really think that I will need it because my STBX and I want to do this in peace. So please can I get some directions if possible ? 


With Me being the petitioner, if I am confident that the respondent will agree to what I submitted, do I just give him the “Acceptance of service” form for him to sign or do I have to add the petition, summons, CIF and notification of filing of CIF as well? Or are there any other documents that I need to add on top of that? 

Does he have to sign them along with the “acceptance of service form” for me to submit or is he the one who needs to submit them?

Also, if he signs the acceptance of service, does he still need to file a response to court or not ?

These are the questions that I have for now and having specific answers would really help me with moving forward.

"Do landlords or tenants pay for rodent extermination in California? *The Issue*


I rent a room in a house in San Francisco. We have an increasing issue with mice. We have traps set all over the house. Although we are catching mice, they are populating faster than we can catch them. IMO, it’s time to call in a rodent extermination service.


*The Property*


This is a 3-story house comprised of three units: one person living in basement unit, 4 people living on main floor, 3 people living on top floor. All units in this house are experiencing mice issues.


*California Civil Code*


I looked up laws in California that have to do with tenants, landlords and rodents. I found a few things which might pertain to our situation


[Civil Code section 1941](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1941&amp;lawCode=CIV)


[Civil Code section 1941.1 paragraph 6](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1941.1&amp;lawCode=CIV)


[Civil Code section 1942](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1942&amp;lawCode=CIV)


[Health and Safety Code section 17920.3 paragraph 12](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=17920.3&amp;lawCode=HSC)


Basically I have a two part question:

Do we the tenants have to pay for rodent extermination services or does the landlord?

And

Do these civil and health codes back that up?"
"Neighbor is being negligent with tree maintenance Hello. Here is my current situation.

I am renting a home with a large yard in Oregon. I have an old shed and a chicken coop in my back yard. My next door neighbors have a massive fir and white oak that are close to the property line, with the limbs hanging over our yard about 70/30 compared to what hangs over theirs. The white oak is dangerously close to the main power line and the power line split off that runs to our home. The fir hangs directly over my shed and chicken coop and every fall I am stuck cleaning 100% of the mess left behind by their oak tree. Recently, they had they had an arborist over to trim some other firs in the yard. While the property owners were here (they live a ways away and currently rent their house), I pointed out the oak and fir trees and asked if they could have the arborists trim them back as well. They said OK. I'm not sure if they didn't explain the scope well enough to the arborist or what, but they only cut 2 small branches off of the oak that were on their side of the fence and didn't even touch the fir.  


I guess what I want to know is when the trees inevitably shed branches and they cause property damage, who is liable? Should I try to contact the property owner directly and ask them to have the arborist come back? I suspect they will say no, but if I can document that, if something does happen will they be held negligent? If it comes down to it, I guess I can reach out to my property owner and see how they would like to address it. But they are not financially stable with everything happening with Covid right now. It is frustrating the neighbors made a conscious effort to clean the trees that make a mess on their property, but didn't bother to address THEIR trees that pose a risk to and create a mess for this property."
"IOWA - Sister's fiance has died and his family wants ""his"" things back, but a line is hard to draw. My sister's fiance has died. They have been together for 5 years, engaged for 2 (would have been married this summer), and have lived together for the past 4 years. When they moved in together it was their first place (sister lived with my parents before that and he lived with his parents) so they furnished it together. They both deal mostly in cash and had their ""own"" paychecks but tried to keep things even; whenever they bought something they usually both contributed some money toward it. My sister has no clue now who ""owns"" the microwave or who ""owns"" the Xbox. It was all just ""theirs"" together.

His family has demanded to enter their apartment to gather ""his"" things. Some things are obvious - like ""his"" shoes but his family wants ""their share"" of the household. They have been going through Facebook photos an asking ""who bought the dining table"" ""who bought the couch"" etc. They bought these things used together over the years. The family says they want to gather and appraise all these items for the sake of his estate, and so that once the estate is settled his parents can sell the things to cover funeral expenses.

When my sister explained that most of their belongings were shared purchases, his parents said they can just divvy up the valuables such that they get 2/3 of the value of the apartment's items (they are arguing for 2/3 because he made about twice as much money as my sister, so they deem that he must ""own"" 2/3 of the stuff).

How does this work, legally? Will she have an obligation to just empty out her home and give it all up to them? Sorry it's just a vague question.  I don't know enough specifics about estates to even know what I should be asking really. Thanks for any thoughts you all may have."
"Stimulus Check Direct Deposited into Joint Bank Account I thought was closed. I filed my 2019 taxes through turbo tax BEFORE I went to the IRS page to apply/get my stimulus check sent. I figured they would load it onto my turbotax debit card like they did my refund.

"[Virginia Vehicle Insurance] Auto Insurance Put Our Policy On Hold, then Told Us We Cannot Activate it for 30 days per Virginia State Law. This is regarding car insurance in the State of Virginia. Less than a month ago we asked our car insurance company (state of Virginia) for options since our car was parked in a secured lot in Maryland temporarily and because of travel restrictions for Covid we are out of town and didn't have access to it.

They suggested they could designate the car in storage and pause liability coverage

Now, we are able to coordinate with a family member (who have their own auto insurance - full coverage) to pick up the car. When we called our auto insurance company to reactivate the policy, they stated that by Virginia State Law they cannot remove the ""vehicle storage"" designation for 30 days. We don't recall being informed of this restriction.

Is this a true statement by Virginia Law - that insurance coverage cannot be reactivated for 30 days? If this is true, is there anything we can do because of special (Covid) circumstance?

If true, would our family member's full coverage insurance be cover them and the vehicle as they transport it from one storage to another?

I haven't heard this 30-day restriction before. In addition, if I remember the driver's full policy carries over if they have to drive the car. If this the 30 day restriction is true and enforced, can the car still be drivable with our family member's insurance carrying over?

Thank you!"
"How Can I Protect My Next Service Dog? EDIT: I currently live in OK, but may not still be here when I get my next dog 

I have epilepsy and a disorder that causes me to experience sudden and profound weakness, commonly resulting in falls and difficulty walking. I had a service dog until he was attacked by an off-leash “service dog,” and then he had to be retired from all out of home work because of that attack. After more than a year, I’m starting to look into foundations to train my next dog. The experience of losing my amazing working dog and watching him turn into a terrified, anxious mess with fear aggression has been the hardest thing I’ve ever dealt with. Although we are technically protected by the ADA, I was advised by several people I met with that cases like this rarely succeed and I have no evidence against the person whose “service dog” attacked him as there were no witnesses but me and them and no cameras. 
 
When I get my program dog (will be at least 3 years), how can I legally protect us? I’ve seen people talk about putting a GoPro on their dog’s harness, but I don’t know the legality of that. I do know that if my dog had had a GoPro on, I’d be in court getting compensation/a new dog at the cost of that person right now. Where I live, it is legal to carry pepper spray, and I’ll literally be attaching some to my dog’s leash. In the two years my original dog worked before that attack, he was attacked many times in stores. I KNOW this next dog will get attacked too, and I want to know what I can do to protect us."
"Ambiguous situation with landlord about ESA? Hello! I am in a situation concerning an emotional support animal application and unsure how to proceed. 

I’ve been living in this unit, a condo, for about seven months. We are in Nevada. I have a good relationship with my landlord (a lawyer in another state) and pay my rent on time. The few questions I’ve had, she’s always been very responsive. 

My girlfriend moved in just over a month ago. I spoke to my landlord before she did and we had her added to the lease as an occupant. 

Recently, because of COVID-19 impacting her work and other issues, my girlfriend’s doctor recommended she get a pet to help alleviate some symptoms of anxiety and depression (my GF absolutely loves cats and always lived with them before moving to my city about nine months ago). Unfortunately, my lease has a no pet policy and says they are forbidden. It goes on to say that if a pet is present without written permission from the landlord, we can be fined a great amount. The HOA for this condo complex also forbids pets for renters. 

I thought that was it, so we let it rest. On her next doctor’s appointment she informed him of this restriction and he said we should get an ESA. He wrote her a letter to show our landlord. 

I hadn’t really heard of an ESA before and neither did my girlfriend, but we did a bit research and it seemed like a good option. 

I sent my landlord an email on Tuesday, April 28th, which said:

“I hope you are doing well. 

I am writing to request an accommodation to allow an emotional support animal (ESA) at [x]. My partner has been working closely with her doctor and he believes that an emotional support animal would benefit her greatly. The ESA would be a cat.

Attached is a letter from her mental health professional which verifies her disability-related need for the assistance animal.

Let me know if there is anything else we can do or need to provide.”

Normally I would hear back from my landlord within hours of initiating contact, maybe a day at most. After the above email, though, days went by without contact. On Friday, May 1, I sent her a text message asking if she had received the email or if I should send it to another email address I had on hand for her. She responded a few minutes later with “Got it. Thanks.”

That’s the last communication I’ve had. There still hasn’t been a response to the initial email. 

We’ve since learned that people have abused ESA requests to get animals into places that forbid them, and now I’m a bit worried that my landlord is miffed. I’m fully willing to cover any potential damages the cat might do to the property, and I figured we would work that out in subsequent emails. 

But we just haven’t heard back. Which leaves two basic options, I think — she’s doing research on her end to see if an ESA is mandated and a reply is still forthcoming (and she’s potentially annoyed with me for asking, but what’s done is done I suppose) OR she was a bit late to respond because she was busy and her short text was essentially confirming that the ESA is okay. The latter doesn’t seem very realistic, as my GF and I figured there was some paperwork or modification to the lease that would be necessary, but we aren’t absolutely sure.

We also aren’t sure how to word a follow-up email to her about this, if the former is the case. My GF still is suffering from anxiety and depression and I’m about to start heading into work again after spending the last two months working from home, thus leaving her alone for most of the day since she lost her job. A cat would absolutely make a big difference for her mental health. 

Any advice on this? Or how to approach a follow up email? I guess I’m having trouble writing another email because I can’t quite figure out the balance between inquiring about her response to the request while also not ceding too much, since everything we’ve seen about legitimate ESA requests seems pretty pro-tenant."
"A certain online retailer is systemically overcharging customers after quoting them a much lower price. What should I do? This is pretty mundane compared to what's going on in the world, sorry if this is small potatoes. I know a lot of people who use this book narration service and it seems to me this overcharging is probably widespread and has potentially gone unnoticed by other customers. Beyond getting a refund from customer support is there anything I can do to get this overcharging practice to stop?

I recently placed a small transaction with a major online retailer for an e-book. After completing the transaction I was offered an audio narration of the book for a discount because I had bought the e-book. I purchased through the offer notification and then found out I was charged for the product more than four times the price I had been quoted.

I inquired with customer support and was told that ""Since the title was pre-ordered you were charged the regular price of the audiobook"" no mention of the original price I was quoted. so I was quoted one price and charged a completely separate amount about four times what I was expecting. The kicker was that the amount I was charged isn't even close to the price *after* release, which was about twice what I paid. I feel that I can reproduce these results with any pre-order transaction with their system, so this was no accident.

I'm not sure how detailed I should be, but here's a quick example:

Item's retail price: ~~$49.95~~ $24.58

Item's pre-order offer price (after purchasing e-book): $5.15

Item's price after release (after purchasing e-book): $12.99

What you get charged: $24.58 + tax"
"YouTube Copyright on my patented product! Hello fellas,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, apologies if this is not the right place to post this but I feel like I could talk about this subject in a couple different subreddits, if not then please accept my apologies.

Here is the backstory:  


I purchased services from a media ""company"" that offers video montages.  
All in all, they made me a montage video using my product and my product only is in the video.  
None of their faces are shown and nothing else but the product and them using it can be seen (and yes them using it shows only their hands)  


Now the trick is that I paid for that video without an invoice or any contract at all (rookie mistake I know) and now they want to Copyright my video that is posted on YouTube only, no TV commercials or anything, YouTube only.  


My question stands here, is there anything I can do against it or can they just copyright it freely since they produced it ? Even though it is my product that is in the video.

Thank you everyone for taking your time to read this, if you need any more information I will be here asap :)  


Best wishes,

"Just received a collections bill for a company that never fixed my issue, so I never paid. I’ll try to keep this short, and I might be in the wrong here, but it made sense to me to not pay.


My A/C in my home wasn’t very cold, so I got this companies number from a friend and they came out to check the unit. The HVAC tech told me I had low freon and so he filled it up. I received a bill within the next week and I paid it.

A month later the same issue popped up, so I called them again and asked them to check for a freon leak. They “looked” but couldn’t find anything and just filled up the freon, I was kind of annoyed but it’s not my area of expertise, so I paid the second bill.

Another month goes by and once again my A/C isn’t cooling very well. I call the same company and tell them I obviously have a leak and I need them to come and fix it. Not fixed once again, so this time I didn’t pay the bill when I received it.

I called a different company at that point and within an hour the new guy took me out and showed me the super obvious spot where the leak was coming from.

Over the course of another month I kept getting bills in the mail and I would call and ask to speak to someone to explain my situation, but somehow the phone operator was never able to get someone in charge on the phone, and I was never called back, despite being told they would pass my message along and my call would be returned.

Over the next year I received a reminder for the outstanding balance once in a while, but they came
less and less often and then stopped altogether.

It’s probably been 2 years and today I got a collections bill in the mail from the original company.

Is there any way for me to fight this? The bill is only $260, but I’m pissed off about the principle of the whole thing. Don’t give shitty service and then demand to be paid for a problem that you didn’t fix, and then have the gall to send the bill to a collection company."
Roommate is requiring me to pay PGE bill that I wasn’t living there for and threatens to take me to small claims court Went home from college due to Covid-19 and roommate split the power bill 6 ways (with only 3 of them living there not including me). I offered to compromise saying I would pay part of it due to natural upkeep of the house but that money is tight. Then threatened to take me to small claims court... is there any validity to that threat or is it mostly an empty threat and can I be held liable?
"kicking adult sister out of my house My sister is 21 and has been living in my house for about a year and a half.  She continuously ignores any rules and allows her dogs to use the bathroom in the house. She has not had a job in all this time and has never paid rent or any other bills. She has no credit history.  Around April 15, I verbally told her she has until May 31 to move out of the house.  Here we are at almost May 10 and she ""might"" have a job.  I have told her again that she has until May 31 to find other living arrangements because on June 1 she will be homeless.  I have been trying to help her find a place (rental place needs credit check and background check, rental house was a scam, travel trailer needs to finance) but I am not going to put my name on anything.  None of her friends seem to have any credit history or are willing to let her move in with them.  No other family member wants to put their name on anything for her.  It has taken a while but I am done with enabling her.  What can I do to make sure she moves by May 31?  I am in TN and I hope she just moves on her own.  She has told me many times how much she hates living here.  but if she does not, what can I do?  Is there some sort of paperwork I need to file somewhere?  Does the pandemic have an effect on eviction in TN?  My county has less than 30K residents so I don't think it falls under the  Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act."
"I was fired, but was not given my paycheck or asked to sign anything (CO) I was let go by my job of 10 months for ""dishonesty and lack of motivation"", yet when they fired me I was not asked to sign a termination form, nor was I presented with my final paycheck, or any evidence to their claims. I filed for unemployment yesterday, the day after they fired me. If I did not sign anything, or verbally state anything, what are my chances of receiving unemployment? I have only signed two write ups prior to this, and neither had anything to do with what they are accusing me of. Should an employer legally present the evidence of their claims when firing someone? I am worried they may try to stop me from collecting unemployment,  which could put me in a dire situation as there are not very many employment opportunities right now. They are also, currently, refusing to tell me if they mailed me my last paycheck, as they did not present it to me when I was terminated. Thank you for your help."
"Signed Settlement and Release Agreement, now trying to cancel the Cheques sent to me? I worked for a company and left due to an unsafe environment. I delt with the Labour Board for money owed for work I did.  As the company would not pay me initially.   
Myself and the other party agreed to terms on what I was owed and both signed a settlement agreement and Release. They sent the cheques to the Labour Board who gave them to me, and the Labour Board kept the agreement to ensure the money was cleared first before giving him a copy.

I cashed the  three cheques beginning of April - meanwhile separately, I was pursuing a Peace Bond against this individual. After th first hearing, I assume the individual got mad and emailed me saying the cheques would all be canceled. 

Is this possible? Since we signed a Settlement agreement can they do this? I'm extremely worried and would love any advice.  This is in NS, Canada."

"Customer intentionally messing up cheques, please help! I'm a Canadian contractor, who is currently a sub trade for a Toronto company. In total I've received 5 different cheques from them, but the last two have been nothing but problems. 

The first was written all over in pen because his, ""printer was low on ink."" I brought it to the issuing bank, they called and confirmed it was him who wrote on it and then proceeded to certify it for me. 
When I brought the cheque to my bank manager, she called and confirmed everything was good. 

Well the back office at the bank pinged the cheque and froze all of my accounts for 2 weeks while they did their own investigation. I was investigated for fraud and that department was accusing me of making a counterfeit cheque. I had no access to my personal or business accounts. 

Now the cheque I just received today is written in my personal name, not my business name and again, written on. I can not cash it. 

I was also just notified that there was something painted that shouldn't be and the cheque has been canceled until the damage is repaired. 

This is a 5 figure cheque that I've been waiting almost two months to receive and again, it's nothing but games. 

Do I have anything I can do legally? I'm thinking of sending a notice that I am currently a paperless company and any payments issued by cheque will be charged a $100 processing fee. 

Any advice?"

"No fire alarms in rented flat for 5 months of residency. Hi, I'm currently living in the UK and as the title suggests my flat was without smoke/fire alarms for 5 months.

This was highly stressful for me as we live above a fast food takeaway so a fire is a serious risk to us.

I brought this up with my landlord several times on text and email and was met with non-committal responses or no response at all.

(For a little more context this landlord also recently charged my roommate a £30 late fee on his rent after he was laid off due to Corona. She was fully informed of this before requesting the fee.)

We've had them installed since mid-March but i have photos of the entire flat without them before that date.

I've had a look in my contract and have found no mention of fire or smoke alarms but feel like this can't be allowed. Continued negligent behaviour from the landlord putting tenants at risk seems serious to me.

Is there a way to claim back the rent we paid whilst there were no fire alarms?
Any info on potential discourse would be appreciated.

Thanks, 
Another Tired Tennant."
"3 years ago crashed a golf cart while working and now passenger is suing me. Not for me, but for my best friend who doesn't have reddit. 

He's a student and resident at a public university in Florida. 3 years ago, he was working for the campus night-time safety transportation service. Basically, it's a number students can call if they feel unsafe walking on campus at night. They use golf carts as their mode of transportation. He was and still is a part-time employee of this place. 

So 3 years ago, he was driving the cart, transporting a student on campus. There are poles on crosswalks so golf carts can get through, but will stop cars from turning onto the sidewalks. So as he was driving (not very fast), he bumps one of these poles (not super hard) and the passenger fell off the back of the cart. He wasn't texting or doing anything wrong. The golf cart also didn't have any visible damage but it was already scuffed up from a bit of wear and tear so it's hard to see what was created. No visible dents though.

The girl is filing suit against the university and against him for negligence and under/uninsured driving. He has a valid FL driver's license and has attended all the trainings for the place he worked. Any help would be appreciated!"

"Is there anyway to get boston calling to do the right thing? Hello...   


After months of stalling Boston Calling announced they would cancel the festival and opened up only a 6 day long window to collect refunds.  


[https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/](https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/)  


I was dealing with many hardships (career and family issues with COVID, as I know many of us are) and really could use the money I spent. They won't even respond to my email, I just keep getting an automated message.   


My  email:

Hello,

I'm writing to you very frustrated. I've  had a terrible series of weeks. I lost my job, my cousin (a police  officer) contracted COVID and has been in and out of the hospital in  critical condition. I had no idea that there was a one week window to  receive refunds. My cousin has only recently been deemed relatively  stable, and I finally found out about the refund situation.

This isn't right. I just called frontgate and they told me I needed to  contact you. How is it fair that we hear nothing for months until March  31, then released the refund instructions weeks later but only kept the  window open for one week? I have had many other things to worry about, and  tickets to the next Boston Calling aren't going to help any of my  problems now.  Please, do the right thing here, I'm begging you. This $539 is nothing  to a company like yours but means so much to me right now.   

Please, OP

&amp;#x200B;

The response:

Thank you for reaching out.  All ticket refund requests submitted by the  deadline of April 28th are currently in process through Front Gate  Tickets.  Additionally, all requests that were received through May 5th  have been submitted to Front Gate Tickets for processing.  At this time,  the refund window is officially closed and we are unable to process  refund requests.  All tickets have been transferred to 2021, along with  applicable benefits here: [https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/](https://bostoncalling.com/refunds/).    
 

Thank you and we look forward to seeing you in 2021."
"Email Hacked Hello all! I created this account off a spare email that I have because my other account has been hacked into. Basically, this dude hacked into my gmail account, changed the password, and kicked me out. After doing some research, I found it that it was a federal crime to do so. This account I have had since I was young, and before I had a phone so it did not have two-factor set up. This account also has all my shipping things on it, my writing, and more. As a teen, I did not want to handle this alone, and talked to my mother about it. My mother dismissed it, saying that they won't be able to find him or do anything so there is no point. I know that this is not true, and I am not stopping until he gets stopped and I get my account back. Google says 3-5 business days, but I want this guy gone.

So Reddit, what should I do in this situation? How bad is it that this person did this? Any help would be useful as to what to do. Thanks

"I was fired right before the lock down and I haven't been able to find a job. Can I apply for unemployment? [VA] I'm a student right now and year or two ago I had a big falling out with an acquaintance who was friends with a lot of my friends. Words were said, bridges were burned, but at the end of the day we stopped talking and our friend groups separated. I didn't think too much about him, and we didn't see each other for a year and a half, until a couple months ago when I was doing routine maintenance for the leasing company I work for and I walked into a house to fulfill a work order and he was sitting on the couch. Turns out he had moved off of campus into that house a couple months prior and he was now one of my employer's tenants. We exchanged pleasantries and I finished the work order, but the next day I was called into my bosses office and told I was put on suspension because a tenant said that I made him feel unsafe. A couple days later they had a meeting with him, he told them about the beef between us, and they decided to let me go because corporate has a policy that if a staff member and a resident has any sort of conflict, they are to fire the staff because of the liability that comes with us possessing master keys and personal information.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue if I was fired with cause. I was never asked to sign any paper work, and I found out about the firing during over a telecom meeting with my boss who just said that 'corporate has decided to let you go'. During my time at my job I always had stellar reviews and performance statistics, and had this guy not made a complaint against me, my bosses were planning on writing a glowing review for me when I applied to corporate after graduation. I am very saddened because I loved my job, but I did quickly move on because at the end of the day this place barely paid above minimum wage.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I was fired in late February-Early March. I was planning on quickly finding a new job and starting work again, but with the lock down going on I haven't been able to find anywhere to work. I am a dependent so I have my dad supporting me somewhat, but I've almost exhausted my entire savings, I'm not eligible for the stimulus, and I am quickly running out of money. I asked my dad if I qualified for unemployment, and he didn't think so because I was fired. That being said, he didn't know for sure but he also implored me not to file for unemployment because he was worried that my old job would contest it and I'd be liable for fraud. Given  that I am a full time college student who was fired from a part time job for events that happened before I was employed, do I qualify for unemployment? Is there anything at all I can do to get money seeing as I physically cannot find a job?"

"Bitten by a dog! Vet says dog hasn't received vaccines since 2016 Hey Reddit!

Mississippi

TLDR: How to request reimbursement from the dog's owner? I don't know them but I have name &amp; number from police report.

Update: after a couple calls and an internet search, rabies in land animals in Mississippi is extremely rare. I feel less concerned about that aspect but I'm still curious about the best way to seek damages.

Full details:
I was bitten by a dog on my way home from work on my bicycle yesterday. Police arrived, took my statement and photos on the wounds and damage to my bike a clothing. My spouse picked me up, we rinsed off the wound and I went to the hospital for a tetanus booster, an antibiotic and proper wound care.

Today I called the vet that the police passed onto me as the animal's caregiver. The vet told me they administer vaccines that need annual renewals and this dog hasn't received theirs since 2016. I know rabies is rare but how nervous should I be  (maybe I'll crosspost to askmedical)?

The hospital (all walkins within an hour+ of me were closed) is going to cost me around $500. The dog put a whole in a pair of jeans, approximately $50. Damage to my bike would be about $50. And a new screen for my phone is probably $100. 

Is it worth pursuing reimbursement with the dog's owner? If so, how would I do that? Should I call the owner directly from the number on their police report? Such a small amount doesn't seem worth hiring an attorney, but I'd appreciate any advice you have!

Addendum: this is a nuisance dog. I've called police 4 times previously before for this same animal and never for any other dog in my life. Before yesterday they never responded in any meaningful way, or at all. Yesterday's office was excellent."
"Too late the refuse to rent to potential tenant? No signed contact yet, but verbal agreement I have a room for rent in my house. Someone, let's call him John, contacted me on craigslist and we set up a chat on Zoom. We got along well enough, although I had some reservations (he has requested I hire a cat sitter if I go out of town for the weekend, he won't do any house or yard work because he ""doesn't care about how things look"", he wants a longer contract than I am really comfortable with, and wants to move in a week earlier than I want). He came to look at the house and then spent the next few days looking at other places. John emailed me a few days ago and said he wanted to move in to my place. I had concerns, but he seemed nice enough and I need the extra money, so I said okay and I would send him a contract.

I emailed him a draft of the standard contract in our state (paid like $30 for it and it was fine for previous tenants) so he could look it over. He came back with a lot of requests including adding verbiage from state code that had been repealed giving him additional legal rights if any part of the contract is broken (even if he is the one to break it). He also wanted me to include guaranteed parking (there is a spot and I told him he is welcome to park there, but there are other people that park there too, and there is plenty of street parking, but he wants a guaranteed on property spot), a promise in the contract to have the AC fixed within a short time frame because he doesn't deal with heat well, and some other things that I am not very comfortable with (two pages of requests). He is also trying to argue about which utilities he should have to pay for because when I said ""share the utilities"" when we talked he didn't think I meant trash and gas (he knew the house uses gas for cooking). Furthermore, he wants me to increase my homeowners insurance because the rental coverage I have covers my stuff he is using (fully furnished room) and loss of renter income if something happens to the house, but it doesn't cover any of his stuff. He doesn't want to be liable for his things if something like a pipe bursts in the house because that isn't his fault.

While John was reviewing the contract, I had a couple other people contact me, one of whom is getting a job with some people I know. We click well and he wants to rent for the exact time frame I was looking for.  I would be much more comfortable renting space in my house to him AND he said he'd pay $175 more than John each month ""and it is still the best price in the are by far!"" (it is quite a steal actually).

What is my legal obligation to John? I did say he could move in, which is why I gave him the draft of the contract. But I am really nervous about someone who wants me to include things in the contract like I have to pay for all legal fees regardless of what the outcome of any case is. What he wants seems aggressive and I was already not completely comfortable with him and this is really off putting. Is it too late for me to back out since he turned down other places already? Can I say no to his requests and say we aren't a good fit and end it there? If I say no to his requests, and he wants to sign the contract anyway, do I have to follow through with it? Nothing is signed by ether party right now.

What are my options and what can I say at this point that won't put me in a bad legal position with him since he is clearly into lawsuits?

"fence line has 2 parallel fences right next to each other. Problem is they need fixing and not sure who is responsible for what. Backstory: 

Im from sacramento county in Ca.  We moved into this house with there already being 2 fences parallel, touching each other really, and now that the years have passed they of course both need to be replaced.  My neighbor cant financially afford it and that's ok, we are willing to cover the costs...HOWEVER...they want to do 16 feet of the fence line themselves, in a very specific style, and not let the contractor touch it.  Why!? I have no clue why but that's what he wants. And he has asked us to pay for the material and that he would build it.  If it was just a normal fence style that is cost effective I'd be fine with that because then I would have the contractor match it but of course he wants this overlapping one that costs a lot more then I'm willing to do for an entire fence line (that I would never see because it's on the side of my house that is honestly not usuable).   That would then make my fence line two different styles and also not finished because he said he wants to take his time on the 16 feet meaning it will never get done.  We are wanting to get a dog soon so if he doesnt fix that portion my dog is going to continously break free.  


Question:

So if we cant come to an agreement on fixing the fence can I legally just replace my fence and leave his untouched and not have to pay half to fix his fence in the future if he decides it needs fixing.  I just really dont want to get done replacing mine for him to then change his mind and want help replacing his side as well, especially if his fence possibly touches my property making me partially required to help with it.  Thank you for the help. Just don't know where to honestly start with all of this headache."

Long story short, my mother and I have lived in this gated community for 20 years. We have had a new neighbor (family) live here for 3/4 years. They have been giving my mother hell, leaving threatening letter in our mailbox that’s address is from the clubhouse. We have no idea why she’s so angry, (it’s the mother targeting us mainly) apparently she has a history of doing this to people and moving out. They wrote my mom a letter say she has HIV, that she screwed up her children, and that she’s going to buy our house out. Keep in mind, our house is worth 700k, my mother just bought it out right before this letter. I’m also a CS major and my brothers 16. we have no proof but we know it’s her- also because the HOA and community director tells my mother and they’re intimidated of this lady. The handyman of the community sent my mom a letter of our neighbor telling the gate “guards, please keep a guest list for everyone who enters for (my moms name) at (our address”. My mom is a hairdresser &amp;amp; had a client come in yesterday, and the client said the gate asked for all her information because the “hoa is having us take all the information”. What can we do??

"Bought something off of Amazon for cheap, but need help. Missouri, United States

I just want to know if anything can come back to me. The company is some obscure company that used to sell screen protectors.

The money has already been taken out of my account (only 50 bucks so if it is a scam I only lose 50 dollars) and the products are pending shipment. I checked this afternoon and the company has completely removed all listings for their electronics.

"Is landlord responsible for pest control? Virginia. 

TLDR; Who is responsible for pest control, tenant or landlord? 

We moved into our current rental in April 2020. The more time we’ve spent here we have noticed whenever it warms up that we have a wasp issue INSIDE the house, we do not have any windows open since moving in, nor do we leave doors open at all. We suspect they are coming in from the attic as there is a door to access it in one of the bedrooms and they’re usually in that bedroom or coming from the bottom of that bedroom door. Window is sealed and in good condition and we’ve also seen wasps go into cracks/spaces on the outside of the house so could be accessing the interior anywhere. 

Today my cat caught a mouse and he is strictly an indoor cat. We do not leave food out at all, we do not have any abnormal amount of trash, literally one small bin in the kitchen which is taken out pretty much every other day and food is rarely put in there anyway. Our trash bin outside is taken every week and is never full. I know that we are not the cause is what I’m getting at. 

This is extremely concerning to me as I’m pregnant and will soon have an infant in the home which I do not want exposed to any of that let alone have to worry that my infant may be stung by a wasp or bitten by a mouse while asleep. 

I want to contact my landlord and ask that it be taken care of but I’m curious who is actually responsible for pest control before I ask the landlord. If I’m responsible then I will be taking care of it myself of course but would definitely prefer not to have to pay to take care of an infestation not caused by me. 

Thank you for any advice!"

"I have a pushy roommate who enjoys getting up in my face, leaning on my chair, and verbally abusing me. I really try to avoid touching other people, but with her up in my face and leaning on my chair, I pushed her back to get her off me. She said she was going to call the cops on me. I'm just looking for some Utah or federal codes that talk about non-aggressively pushing someone back who is in your space, or in your room or laws restricting people from being in other people's personal space. I actually share a room with this person's boyfriend, and I can't prevent her from coming in and out. I don't want to just let her get uncomfortably close and not do anything about it. I figure most of these interactions are regarded as fine by the law. I know if two siblings had this interaction, it wouldn't seem very important. But I'm someone who does not want anything happening to me or in my space that I haven't consented to directly. And the best way of dealing with adults is by using the law against them. Basically, I want to know what I can legally do to prevent her from being in my space (whether by pushing her back slightly or telling her to leave my space) and what she can legally do to me, so I can come to terms with the parts of her abuse the law can't do anything about.

"Insurance companies not in agreement Awhile back, my parked car was hit in an accident caused by a collision of two other cars. I was not present at the scene so I was not there when my parked car was towed. Fast forward many months, one car insurance company decides that the fault is a 50/50 split meanwhile the other insurance company is denying all fault 100/0. From what I understand, they were negotiating for months regarding the fault, however neither company has budged from their respective conclusions. As such, the company denying all fault said they would go to arbitration so that a third party could have the final say in deciding the fault. 

This is where I begin to become a little lost. Despite not reaching an agreement, the insurance company denying all fault has decided not to go to arbitration. I had thought that the purpose of arbitration was to force some form of agreement. The denying insurance company tells me to contact the alternative company, so I did. This company (50/50) said that they cannot provide any further payment since they had met their conclusion. The same can be said for the denying insurance company- no payment can be made since that they’re, well, outright denying it. So at this point, they are not negotiating and they are not going to arbitration. Can anyone help me with this please? About myself, I do not have any collision coverage under my policy so that was not an option to begin with. I spoke with a representative from my insurance (same as the insurance deciding 50/50) and I was informed that both parties did reach a conclusion (50/50 and 100/0) but they did not understand why there was such a variation in the fault that was decided. They then recommended for me to contact the initial adjusters again to see why their split was found at what it was found to be. This seems useless to me because even if I know why they found the percentages that they did, I can’t do anything to change it. At the end, I was informed that both parties had done what they could despite it not being in my favor. So I am asking what can I do as a not-at-fault party that has not been sufficiently compensated for the damages to my vehicle?"
"(Kentucky) Question about consideration certificate and quitclaim deed. Probably a simple and boring question but I don't want to screw this up:

My ex-wife and I were divorced 8 years ago and as a term of the divorce she was to sign a quitclaim deed to remove her name from the deed of our marriage property.

We never filed the paperwork and now years have passed and I was about to refinance my home, and whoops her name is on there still. 

We have filled out a Kentucky specific quitclaim deed that I downloaded from eforms.com.  From there I was directed to a form called the consideration agreement
&gt; Consideration Certificate – Must be attached to the Quit Claim Deed before recording at the County Clerk’s Office.

 which says this:

&gt; Use this form if “Gift” or “Nominal Consideration” is stated on the Deed. Transfer
tax is due on the Value of said property

The consideration agreement talks about buyers and sellers and tax -- there is no buyer or seller here, she is just having her name removed from the deed.  Is this consideration agreement required? If so how do I fill it out?

"Mortgage with ex Hi me and my now ex bought a house last year (August) for £140,000 things were ok at first but as time went on she become very controlling telling me what i can and can't do in my own home, yelling at me in front of her family for trivial things like walking past her in the hallway saying its dangerous, or yelling at me for not cleaning her blender to her standard after i used it, or when she asked me to make her sister a drink and she went in a mood with me saying i poured to much, or spying on me checking how much bubble bath i use in the bath. She then went cold with me and when i tried to communicate she'd just say she's tired and shes going bed. It eventually got to the point where i could not please her and i was in a dark place lost and confused because we just bought a house and she was being horrible to me, she was once so loving and kind to me (never been one for affection) It's hard especially when you love someone so much like i did her. Here's the awkward part. She can't buy me out of the house because the bank said they won't allow her too, she offered me half of my deposit back saying shes being fair, she's also saying she'll sell the house but asking for wayyy over the asking price knowing it won't sell. She's being so awkward and refusing to communicate with me or give me my key back (i left them there, i know big mistake) she's not taking any pics and sending them me ether so i can use them to give the estate agents. She's aslo seeing a new guy 3 month's after the break up and has him staying there. That's not a big issue because i genuinely want her to move on with anyone so she will wake and and realise that this nightmare needs tl end and we can both move on with our lives. She's going to be so difficult i can see it, this house is her pride and joy shes constantly posting it on social media and inviting friends round for drinks and food while I'm at my mums rotting in depression with zero self esteem. I know i could go round but she would make me look the bad guy and I'd end up in prison because of her. The solicitor is on the case but it's taking time. Has anyone else experienced anything like this and what was the outcome. Thank you"
"Venue will not give deposit back if I cancel my event in New Jersey, USA Venue will not accept our request for a cancellation without taking our entire deposit, despite asking about it since the beginning of April. I've been emailing them regarding the COVID19 situation for the past 2 months and have had a few phone calls asking about cancellation possibilities. We have too many high risk family members declining to attend and that my fiance lost his job during this crisis, so we would feel better holding onto the rest of our wedding budget to prepare for the worst. They would not give us a straight forward answer if June weddings are to be cancelled or not.

The venue is instead offering a new date later in the next year, even after we've said we don't agree with any other dates. They're stating that we lose 100% of the deposit put down if we choose to cancel. Is there any way around this or are we at the mercy of this venue?

Relevant part of the contract below. I'm not trying to screw the venue over - this happened unexpectedly... But we're also not in a position to spend a large amount on an event at the moment.

10. In the event of inclement weather or natural disaster, if the Caterer must cancel this function the terms of Paragraph 6 (a) shall control. However, should the Caterer be prepared in the event of inclement weather or natural disaster to go forward, and it is reasonable prudent to do so, but the Hose cancels, then the damage provision of Paragraph 6(c) shall apply≥ If the Caterer and Hosts mutually agree to move the event to a future date due to circumstances of the inclement weather or natural disaster, than this Agreement will be amended with written consent by the Caterers and the Hosts.

6. CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS — DEPOSITS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AS SET FORTH BELOW  

a. Should the Caterer be unable to perform for reasons beyond his control, Caterer shall be obligated to notify Hosts as soon as reasonably possible and shall return advance deposits. Should this occur, Caterer also agrees to make reasonable efforts to assist the Host in obtaining an alternate location for the event, but in no event is caterer obligated to incur costs in providing such assistance. 

b. Host may cancel the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 7 days after this agreement is signed, in which event the deposit will be immediately refunded without charge. However, if the date of this Agreement is less than 14 days before the function, and same is canceled even within 3 days of the signing this Agreement, the caterer may keep the Advanced Deposit as liquidated damages.  

c. If Host cancels the event by written notice to Caterer within a period of 10 days of the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred percent(100%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value.  

d. If Host cancels the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 10 prior to and not less than 75 days from the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of seventy-five percent (75%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value.  

e. If Host cancels the event by written notice to the Caterer within a period of 75 days prior to and not less than 180 days from the event date Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of fifty percent (50%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value. 

f. If Host cancels the event by written notice to the Caterer after 7 days of signing contract up to 180 days prior to the event date, Caterer will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five percent (25%) of all the charges set forth in the Agreement based upon the minimum guarantee which Hosts agree to pay. Such amount shall not be payable if by customary and reasonable efforts the Caterer rebooks the facility for the same period of time for a function of equal or greater value."
"Paid taxes on cancelled auto extended warranty I bought a car late February. With that used car purchase, I opted for an extended warranty. 

Two days later, after actually learning about the warranty, I called and had the warranty removed.

As of February, the warranty is no longer on my auto loan principal as it had been voided off.

Fast forward to today. When tagging and finishing up my auto taxes, I paid taxes on the gross purchase value of the car ... Which included the extended warranty ($1500) that has been long voided. 

The county office told me to call the warranty company (Assurant) or the dealership to get a refund. 

Is this $150 worth the trouble or even plausible to get back?"

"Charging more for employee parking than agreed This is in Ontario Canada

"Prematurely signed lease from Craigslist sublet, haven't yet paid, can't identify property owner preface: I fucked up, I'm aware of it. I know I should've done all of this before signing anything. 

I'm trying to find a lease on craigslist for a month in another city. the listing provided photos of the property - they sent over a lease which I signed, but I haven't sent payment yet. their name isn't showing up as owning property on the register of deeds, so I'm going to call the city's housing office on Monday and inquire further

**my question** is if I'm totally unable to verify that the landlord on the lease owns the property, what should I do? I know I fucked up by signing the lease, and that it's a valid contract, but how should I go about this? what kind of proof should I ask for, or what actions should I take to guard against scamming?

my thinking is: the lease agreement specifically provides the address that I agreed to pay the landlord for, so if they don't actually own that property, the contract should be invalid, and I don't need to worry about liability - if they do own the property, then there's no issue, because I'm happy to stay at the advertised property if it's legit"
"Contact issues Hello, I have a question about a contract for a karate class.  We live in KY, I signed my kid up for karate last year maybe 7 or 8 months ago, things were great and we paid the monthly fee.  We signed a contract for a year and to cancel the contract it says you have to pay 60 days worth of fees, so about $250.  The issue I have is, ever since this Covid virus started they have shut the gym down. But they are doing classes posted to Facebook and occasionally they use zoom.  Am I able to call my bank and have them stop the payments and not have to pay a cancellation fee if they aren’t having classes in person at their gym but instead online?  I’m asking because sometimes we don’t get updated over Facebook that a course has been posted so we miss it and also we don’t feel like zoom is secure enough to use because my wife has lots of confidential stuff that she has for work and is working from home now.  Is there any repercussions if we cancel the payments or can they sue us or send us to collections? Do I have any options or do we just have to pay the cancellation fee and deal with it? Thanks for any and all advice."

"IT Consultant trying to switch jobs and relocate I work as a consultant in IT for a small systems integration company in Atlanta, GA. I frequently have exposure to many customers and  technologies as part of my normal workflow.

I'm  currently trying to switch employers from my current  employer to a large defense contractor located in Colorado. Yesterday I tried to provide a two week notice to my employer and they stated that if I were to take this position, I would be in breach of contract.

Their reasoning is that I  have violated the following clause in my employment contract.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;3. Non-Solicitation of Customers  
&gt;  
&gt;During the Restricted Period, You shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Customer of the  
&gt;  
&gt;Company for the purpose of selling or providing any products or services competitive with the  
&gt;  
&gt;Business. The restrictions set forth in this Section apply only to Customers with whom You had  
&gt;  
&gt;Material Contact during the term of Your employment.

&amp;#x200B;

During my employment with my current company, I worked indirectly for the defense contractor in question \~2 years ago for a period of 6-8 weeks. This contract was obtained by my company as a subcontractor through the company Chef. As I  understand it, the defense contractor contacted Chef to do this work, and Chef subcontracted this work to my employer, who assigned me to do the work.

Because  of this 'material work' that I performed for the defense contractor, they believe I  am in violation of this clause and would be open to legal action if I  were to pursue this position further. I have consulted with my prospective employer and  they recommended I seek independent council, as they believe this would  not hold up and that my company is using this clause to bully me out of accepting a new position.

I've already contacted a few employment attorneys in my area, but I'd like to poll you guys and see what you think before I can get an official answer.

"Lease requires us to give 90 days notice of non-renewal of lease which we missed, do we have to stay? We first leased our current apartment in July of 2018. Our leasing agency offered us to renew the lease in April of the 2019 and we agreed knowing we wanted to stay. The lease ends June 30th and (best case scenario) we were hoping to go month to month for a while until this whole virus situation calms down or (next best case) move out once our lease was up. 

When I was looking at our lease to see when exactly our move out date was, I noticed that it stipulates that we must give “proper notice” if we don’t plan to renew. The exact wording:

“This lease will AUTOMATICALLY RENEW for a term of one year + 5% rent increase at the ending date of this lease or any renewal term unless proper notice is given. Proper notice requires the Tenant or Landlord to provide written notice of nonrenewal at least 90 days prior to the ending date of this lease or any renewal term.”

Are we stuck here for another year? I know we read the lease fully when we signed it (our initial lease and the renewal) but we both forgot about this stipulation. Our apartment building was bought and our leasing agency changed and the new agency didn’t mention anything about renewing like our previous agency did. I know we should have remembered about this clause/checked sooner but we’d rather not stay her for another full year. 

We’re in Philadelphia (PA)

Edit to add: I know we could probably sublet our apartment if need be but we’re hoping to see if that’s necessary first."

"Saw a promotion for Subway Pick Up orders due to COVID-19: Buy one get one free via pick up orders online. Placed a pick up order online, went to store, was told people already took my food? Come back home with receipt for my order, but no food and negative money? Store owner argues I am scamming? Hello and good day, this is a throw away account since I am a very private person and have anxiety related to privacy due to being agoraphobic


For context, I have recorded the phone conversation between myself and the Subway store owner (although I cannot post it here at /r/legaladvice).  I recorded the conversation because I realized after 7 minutes of talking to him about not receiving food for pick up he was becoming more hostile, accusatory, and yelling at me.

When I posted this originally my own youtube channel and not a throw away youtube channel, I shared this with Subway corporate as well as him.


He then [posted this as a comment which he later then deleted](https://i.imgur.com/tpqRmWV.png) but I still have it in my youtube notifications of what he posted regardless of him deleting it, because that message was redirected to me from the youtube servers where the message is still saved



He has accused me of:

1)  A liar

2)  A thief

3)  Organized Crime

4)  Technologically unaware

Also the most offensive thing he suggested was that my mom should go to the Subway store and order in person (even though she has a cochlear implant and can't hear that well doesn't understand English) for a longer duration than necessary during COVID-19 in new york city, the largest city effected in the USA.


I do not take this lightly at all, my father passed away in January, 5 months ago it will be in 10 days from today. And I do not appreciate having to think about any scenario of which the few of the family I have left will pass away because a SUBWAY STORE OWNER DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO EFFECTIVELY RUN A SUBWAY IN 2020 WHEN ONLINE ORDERING IS A COMMON THING.

All of which I find offensive, over $17.69.  Why did they give my mom a receipt for the food but no food?  If other people took my order like they suggested, then why didn't they give them the receipt?  [Why is there a receipt left to give to my mom?](https://i.imgur.com/d0k7eTD.jpg)


My phone number is on the receipt, why they call it to make sure whoever was picking up my order was me by simply calling?

There is a unique order confirmation #


Why did they not double check with the persons picking up the order this UNIQUE confirmation #?  Is this not the purpose of the UNIQUE order confirmation number?

Only the legitimate customer can know it, instead the employees just assumed the first person to walk through the door was there to pick up my order instead and asked if they were me.



This is the only way I can think of what happened, happened if what the Subway store owner was saying is true or rather his employees are saying is true because the store owner had told me over the phone he was not present at the subway store.  Instead when I called him, he simply called the Subway store and asked the employees what happened and believed it without questioning at all and then defaulting to accuse me.

I saw a promotion from Subway for pick up orders due to COVID-19 and to practice safe social distancing to lessen time spent in the physical store.


The promotion was exclusive to online / pick up orders placed online at the subway.com website:


[""DIGITAL EXCLUSIVE BUY ONE GET ONE FREE ONLY IN THE APP OR ONLINE""](https://i.imgur.com/PYOegsE.png)


I don't order subway often, 4 times total since the beginning of this year and since I have been agoraphobic -2004.

I used to enjoy Subway a lot more as a teenager, there was one near my dad's office 17 or so years ago and I would spend a lot of time at my dad's office around then and we would have a tradition getting subway for lunch together if we were lazy since it was close by.


But either my taste for Subway since I was a teenager has changed or the sandwiches have.

My dad passed away back in the middle of January of this year, 4 months ago and some days. [A few months later in March I would order Subway 3 different times](https://i.imgur.com/CZKWGLD.png), all the same kind of order, [at least 1 meatball and 1 chicken teriyaki since we shared half a footlong of those and 1 other variety of sandwich](https://i.imgur.com/1tP6Teg.png) to see what's new at subway for pick up online I guess to help me relive a moment with my dad from years ago.


It's just not as good as I remember, but I figured since all the restaurants that I frequent near me are mostly closed or I am bored of what is left available I thought I'd get subway since it is cheap considering my order was only $17.69 which is a lot cheaper than [what I normally spend on delivery/take out meals (usually anywhere from $30-$100)](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr) and thought it might bring back some momentary nostalgia.


[This order history is from delivery.com where I have never had a problem over years and this is only half my orders since I also order from Seamless / Grubhub for more variety of food since there restaurants on Seamless / Grubhub that are no available on delivery.com](https://imgur.com/a/cOKRvrr)


If you notice throughout my history I used to buy cigarettes delivered to my door through their delivery service, the mark up was incredibly high, [$18.95 a pack and would order about 7 packs a time also having to pay a 15% delivery tip and then tax](https://i.imgur.com/ezxYfyq.png) 


But that was the price I was paying since I am an agoraphobic and having anxiety with my privacy and leaving my apartment



The most infuriating thing about all of this is that his Subway store is being leased by the apartment building I live in.  And my family is the home owner of our apartment, BUT I AM PAYING THE MORTGAGE AND MAINTENANCE FEES.


So I am essentially chipping money for the maintenance fees to help maintain his Subway store.


I feel very bad and humiliated


The whole reason why I do not go outside is because I used to face a lot of judgement and I felt ashamed.


I remember one of the few days I was leaving my apartment building and the ""doorman"" / concierge did not know who I was nor did I know her.  I was getting off the elevator and entering the lobby where my own concierge looked at me and said, ""wow you're the fattest chink I ever saw""  I was leaving the apartment building at the time to collect a treadmill I was collecting from the delivery truck parked outside.  I remember feeling very unsafe even just leaving outside my apartment door after that.


The only few times I have ever left my apartment since 2004 was to go to a dentist, two times and attending my father's funeral and burial service.  I am sure there are other few moments, but there are spans of 1-4 years I never leave at all.


I don't know anyone locally, I don't have any friends locally, how am I supposed to arrange people to come steal food from a Subway store?


The store owner is accusing me of being a liar, a thief, organizing some sort of crime between myself and others, when in reality I do not harm anyone simply based on the fact I don't even have access to anyone.


It really hurts me because now I feel even less safer at home, if I cannot feel safe at home then where can I feel safe?


I am being shamed, labeled a criminal, liar, thief, scammer and I did nothing without any possibility to do anything he is saying.


I have spent the past 16 years avoiding any reason why anyone should judge me


That day I was offering to give him my business which if continued he could make a lot of repeat business off me since pretty much one of the few luxuries I get experience in life as an agoraphobic is ordering food, and I order a lot.

But instead that day I was left negative money and no food
How is ANY of that fair?


I feel ashamed for having to defend myself by exposing myself with my secret I keep from anyone I do know who is not my family (online friends, well online friend) when all I did was order sandwiches that were promoted to use the Online order pick up service.


I even called corporate and have a phone conversation with them,  they have not helped me at all since.  Thinking about this keeps me up at night and even prevents me from fulfilling my work and I am very busy the next two months.



Is there any legal course I can take against Subway or the Store owner?"
"UPDATE: Planet Fitness lied... Just wanted to post an update for the fraud Planet Fitness committed, you can see the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gci20l/planet_fitness_lied/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

So after I received that letter with the very old photo of me with the doctored date and time and the fake check in date and time of March 06, 2020 12:30pm, I called my bank like you all directed me to do. I did really want to contact Planet Fitness directly and tell them they committed fraud and my hair hasn’t looked like that for at least a year AND I haven’t even been in that state since November. I decided not to because I figured it might give them time to come up with an excuse/rebuttal. 

The dispute analyst at my bank initially told me I was out of luck because the dispute was put in as fraud initially, which was technically incorrect because I signed a contract with them and gave them my bank info. He didn’t realize that the photos and check in times were fake and that they lied, so after I explained all of that with proof he said it was then a fraudulent case. Also since I made it very clear I wanted to cancel, that should’ve been enough to stop debiting my accounts moving forward. 

I sent over a letter from myself, a letter from my boyfriend who lives with me and can attest that I hadn’t been to that state since November, a bank statement with charges in a different state that same day and a letter from my boss with clock in times showing I was at work that day and time. 

Needless to say they will not be returning the money to Planet Fitness and closed the case. The bank analyst told me that they can move forward with repercussions, since they are committing fraud against the bank technically, but I have already prepared a letter for the AG. Hopefully this post alone causes some people to be weary of the MANY fraudulent things this gym does. I have received so many messages and comments proving that this isn’t an isolated event and pretty common amongst other shady things. Watch who you give your money to! 

Thanks again for the help"
"Do we have grounds to break our lease? Hi. So my and boyfriend and I have lived in the same apartment in Albany, NY for two years. Our landlord is not the friendliest landlord but we haven't really had any issues in 2 years. In early March, we developed a mouse problem. Our landlord brought an exterminator out, although we are unsure of her actual exterminating credentials. We didn't ask because we trusted that our landlord was hiring someone legit. But she came in, put some glue traps and poison down and left. The whole process took 15 minutes. Since then, we have had over five mice sightings in two months, and every time it is met with the same response. Send this lady out, she puts some traps and poison down, and leaves. 

Since this is an ongoing issue, we found an extermination company with high reviews and, after seeing a mouse for a 6th time last night, I texted him this morning asking that he use this company instead. I'm not sure if you all need the exact wording of the text, but the jist was ""We don't feel as if the other exterminator is doing enough. We know people who have personally used this company and loved them. Please don't take this the wrong way, but we would really prefer is you call this company as soon as possible to fix this problem."" He responded with ""No way I could take your order on who to use and your command to do it today the wrong way. I will find someone new and schedule an appointment"". We are, frankly, sick of dealing with this problem. We've been really nice about it and it's causing us to feel unsafe in our apartment (the mice not the sassy landlord). 

Here is the issue. We just re-signed the lease on May 1st. We assumed the mouse problem had been taken care of because we hadn't seen a mouse in a couple of weeks. But the new sighting has confirmed that it was not taken care of. There is a clause in the lease that says ""Tenant stipulates, represents and warrants that Tenant has examined the Premises, and that they are at the time of this Lease in good order, repair, and in a safe, clean and tenantable condition."" We would love to break this lease and move at the end of the month, we actually found another apartment down the street from us with a great landlord about an hour ago. But we fear that we don't have any legal grounding to stand on for breaking the lease. But, at the same time, we did see online that NYS has a law that tenants can break a lease if there is a rodent problem that is not being taken care of. 

Additionally, we gave our landlord a signed copy of the lease on April 30th (after having to hound him for a new lease for three weeks). He has not yet returned a copy with his signature on it to us as of today, 5/8/20. Not sure if that matters.

What say you lawyers of Reddit? Would we be able to break the lease even though we signed that the apartment was in livable conditions at the time of signing? Do we have any leg to stand on when it comes to breaking the lease? We are completely kicking ourselves for signing for another year, but we do really love this apartment, weird landlord and all. We just can't take the mice roommates any longer."
"Tree near property line...Who is responsible for expense of cutting down? (Located in Illinois). We recently had a new neighbor move into the house directly behind us. There is a large tree that has branches that overhang on our roof, clog our gutters and the leaves/seeds that drop into the yard will start growing little mini trees unless pulled up. Very annoying! We've wanted the tree cut down for these reasons, but when we bought the house we were told the tree was the neighbors. The property line goes right down the middle of the space between the houses and the tree is about 1/3 on our property (basically just the roots). We have talked to the neighbor. She said she is planning on getting a cracked branch cut down that looks like it is close to falling. She would like the tree to be completely cut down as well but was told the tree was shared between her and us and that she would need us to give permission to cut it down but she also wants us to pay for half of the cost. If it is true that the tree is half ours and we are responsible for it, we are willing to work with her to split costs but we also don't want to be conned into paying for half of the tree removal if it is her tree and solely her responsibility. Is there some way to find out who the tree belongs to?"
"Uninsured Motorist Scam My Father is a policyholder of AAA insurance in California. He has uninsured motorist coverage. It was my understanding that you purchase this coverage for times when a party strikes your car and then flees the scene. Obviously you would have no way to know but it would be assumed they didn’t have insurance?

He has liability only coverage plus the above addition. His car, 2004 Trailblazer, was struck on Sunday parked at the curb. When he came out Monday morning there was damage to both front and rear drivers doors and the passenger side view mirror. He called to report the claim on Tuesday. 

AAA wants to deny the claim based on no comprehensive coverage, stating it was an accident and a car did it. Also that there isn’t a way to verify the other party does not have insurance so the “uninsured motorist” coverage doesn’t apply here. However, there is no way to see what caused the damage during the night. No cameras, no eyewitnesses, no paint transfer. The area he lives in is very high foot traffic and his property has been vandalized before. 

Do I have any recourse? A better way to pursue the claim? Thanks in advance. 

TL;DR : car got damaged,insurance doesn’t want to cover or pay anything to fix, what do I do?"
Charged with breaking and entering and two counts of fraud One of the people in my student complex had ps4 and ps3 games taken. It was found that I had came into possession of these games and had sold them at a local game store. The 2 counts of fraud are proven but the count of breaking and entering is not. I did not steal the items as one night I was taken rubbish down to the dumpster and saw these games inside. I had assumed someone threw them out and had the proceeded to sell them not knowing they were stolen. What are my options here and how likely are these charges to be thrown out the window. I'm 19 and I only made $70 from this sale. I'm in Australia btw. Please help I'm really scared
"Stolen property not being compensated So I had an accident on December 29th, 2019. And my car was taken to a lot. When I went to the lot to grab all of my belongings out of my car, my longboard was missing out of my trunk. Well I have an accident report that included the belongings in my car on paper: skateboard football jumper cables (which the cables weren’t there either but I was more pissed about the longboard) a friend gave that to me when I didn’t have a car and I used it to take me anywhere. Have had it for 5 years. Well a lady, let’s call her Ana was helping me with the situation, I mentioned the longboard to them the same day I was there collecting my stuff. One day they said they had it so I go in, and it’s not mine it’s a different one. So they see if they can do anything else. Well me and Ana were emailing back and forth and then after about 4 weeks of no response I called to find out she didn’t work for them anymore. Today is May 8th I’m still dealing with this. I showed up yesterday for the first time in months mind you I have no transportation and this place is about a 20 min drive from my place. Been working two jobs and was taking calculus 2 during spring semester, and then with the virus and everything I haven’t been able to go over there. But yesterday I showed up with my accident report showing my belongings. And they had some guy named jimmy just have me take down his number and said he’d help me by the end of the day he asked for a picture of it and asked how much it is, when i said idk around $120 maybe? He was all ‘oh wow that’s nothing you should’ve told me a long time ago’. Call him at 4pm he said he’s standing around waiting for the owners. Never calls me back. Today I call the lot and explain my situation to the lady just asking what are they gonna do for me because come on? She hangs up on me. It’s not that hard, you either give me my longboard or compensate me for it.

Where do I go from here? I’m honestly ready to just show up and call a cop to come help me out and report a theft.. not sure. I don’t even care about the money that much I really just want the longboard back, but I know I’m not gonna see it again so I’ll take money. You don’t just steal shit out of people’s cars and think it’s ok. I live in Miami, FL. 

TLDR - some worker at a towing lot stole my longboard, they’re going out of their way to not compensate me. I have proof of my belongings on paper"
"Bought a problemed vehicle from dealership. Thinking about legal action. Advice? (WI) Recently, we purchased a used vehicle (Audi) from a smaller dealership/shop, that we had found out of town (70mi) as we have been looking for this particular model and weren't finding many on the market.

Upon arrival the owner informs us of the faults of the vehicle (driver power mirror doesnt move, climate control display has some burn out) and states that they just replaced the intake manifold on it as they tend to have issues with internal valves (keep this part in mind.)

Test drive start, get in and go to start it with keyless start, barely cranked and displayed a battery light. Guys had the car a couple of months so makes sense a battery could be low, but started fine then with key in the ignition. Teat drive goes ok, minor pull but hard to say how the roads are, no real concerns other than a little vibration at stop in gear. Overall we purchase the vehicle.

On drive home, I'm following and I notice that when my girlfriend was changing lanes, her blinker went to right on then left for a couple then right during the lane change. I figured she had bumped it weird or whatever.

Probably the second day of owning it, only driving it about 100 or so miles in total, the battery dies on us at the store. Get a jump to get home and purchased a new battery. We notified the dealership immediately but ultimately I decided it's not a big deal I would prefer a new battery anyways as we had planned on owning the vehicle for a while. The battery was significantly low on electrolyte in one cell. And the seat bolts were rusted down (battery under seat) indicating that the battery itself was not actually inspected.

 During this battery debacle, I had learned that the key for the ignition does not actually go into the mechanism in the door itself.

Back on the road, I noticed that sometimes when you hit the blinker switch to the right, it will flash right once, then go to the left, either fixing itself or mostly staying on left. Only when you lightly press it down, will it fix. This indicates to me a faulty switch internally.

Soon there after, we experienced the wipers come on by themselves, only once, and had the climate control turn on 3 times in a row before it finally stayed off as we had it.

Then suddenly after about 150 or so miles with the new battery, we get a CEL. Pull the code and it is running too lean. Possible vacuum leak. They did replace the intake. I take a look at the intake manifold and notice that the upper housing is adhered with liquid gasket maker, which would not be OEM nor spec as there should be a gasket there.

I have messaged them through facebook messenger only to document our interactions as they have no email listed on their website.

During our conversation I remained professional and left out any personal feelings as much as possible to make the conversation flow. I stated the issues we have been experiencing since the purchase and my concerns with such problems as these were things marked ok or in working order on the window sticker. 

During our conversation it was discovered that the intake assembly was a used unit and states that his mechanic did not inspect the manifold itself because it was a working unit. (How they know I unfortunately didn't ask. )In my opinion, when there is gasket maker where there shouldn't be, you should probably inspect it. I was not happy to learn this information as the condition of that manifold is unknown, mileage, etc. Had the info been given that it was replaced with a used unit, I probably would have declined the sale.

We gave him 3 options. First being a buyback of the vehicle for full price. Second, I would take in for a quote on repairs from an actual certified audi dealership and he would pay for said repairs. Lastly would be legal action. 

He states that he has his policies where he doesnt buy back and doesnt allow others to work on vehicles for him. He is adamant about me bringing him the vehicle so only his shop can repair it, in which, my opinion was not done right the first time and clearly gives me doubts about their ability to actually repair the vehicle properly.

I asked him from our conversation what issues will he be addressing and how will he go about doing so, and will he be offering any short term warranty on the service performed. I have also asked for proof that he can service to audi spec by requesting information on his mechanics certifications in ASE and any other certificates possibly obtained through Audi/Volkswagen making him familiar with their programming in their vehicles. 

I have not heard anything back about the tech. They've offered to come pick it up and service it. Like I said, we don't trust they will be able to since they didn't in the first place. We really just either want our money back or to have it serviced by somewhere that understands Audi's and can give a sense of security behind it.

So with that here are my questions to you guys,

 Do we give them the opportunity to fix it and if it still fails, then go the legal route? What if it fails too far out for any legal action? Do we have to allow him the opportunity to fix it?

 Do we even currently have any leg to stand on when it comes to buyers protections in wisconsin? 

What would be my next steps in legal action? Do I file a complaint with the state? Talk to an attorney? If so, what kind?

Thanks for any help you guys can give."
"Unsafe living conditions in 3 unit apartment building So about 6 months ago I moved into an apartment building which is in a bad area where drug dealers live across the street, down the street and up the street. I knew that moving in as I did not have many options. It doesn’t bother me I just keep to myself. However, I expect when I move into an apartment building that my downstairs neighbors OBVIOUSLY wouldn’t be. But that’s not the case. The property managers already know about it. They also know they smoke and don’t do anything about it. 

          They have had 5 windows broken since I moved in 6 months ago. A back door kicked in. Smoking in the building. A few overdoses. Last night her boyfriend kicked in the door with a knife and got arrested and all that. I had my window opened listing to a random girl I have only ever seen a few times tell the officer that herself and 5 others live in there when I know there is only 1 person on the lease. Is there any way I can get out of this apartment building without paying the remainder of my lease?"
"Husband was a bigamist My husband died 3.5 years ago and I just spent almost 3 years in probate with his children from the first wife.  During probate I discovered that he never bothered to divorce his first wife (children's mother).  She admitted that she does not remember getting a divorce.  She has Alzheimer.   We NEVER found evidence that there was a divorce.  I discovered on our marriage application that he lied about the place he supposedly got divorced from her.  Do I have a case against her?   My attorney does not think that I have a case or that it would be too difficult to prove.   

I am so angry, hurt and embarrassed.  I lost so much during the probate procedure due to this.

Please advise.  Thank you in advance."
"Is a husband responsible for a child conceived outside of the marriage? This is in AL and the couple are estranged and have been living separately for 2 years. One of my friends is a married man. His wife is estranged and now pregnant with another man's child that she is living with.  Wife claims that her husband (that is not the father) has to be legally responsible for the child since they are still married and legally he must sign the birth certificate. Is the child considered a product of the marriage and is he reponsible for child support?

Would a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity be of any use in this situation? The man that the wife is currenty with wants to marry her and take care of the child."
"Parents both died. Question about estate? My dad died in March (Michigan.) My mom just passed away a few days ago (Missouri.) She was my dad's heir we believe, there were complications with the death certificate so we haven't been able to receive the official will but we have what we believe is the most recent copy. 

My mom died before she could do anything with my dad's life insurance or estate. I contacted the life insurance company and they said since she hadn't claimed it they would disperse it to my sibling and I. 

My family property should have passed entirely to my mom we believe but now she's gone as well. It was 100% paid off. 

My dad and mom both have a couple of credit cards. My dad has one loan that my mom was also on for around 5-7k I think, they owe about $1k in last year's property taxes. 

I have an appointment with a probate lawyer on the 21st but I'd like some advice now if possible. 

The internet is confusing. It says we aren't responsible for their debts but then something else says their estate can be liquidated to pay their debts. We want to keep the property obviously. I don't think It is worth much as it's just a trailer but it is on property, maybe 15 acres. 

Would we have to pay the debts in order to prevent the home from being sold? My sister and I were named secondary beneficiaries on the will we have but since my mom died first and she had no will, would it have passed to her? Or no because she didn't survive long enough to get the official will and begin the process?

We promised my dad we would never sell the property. If we have to pay their debts we will but this life insurance money is badly needed after a few years of struggling. 

I guess my biggest questions are: is the property at risk of being sold to pay debts?
Can the life insurance be partially taken to pay their debts?

Thanks in advance."

"Hospital billed wife's insurance incorrectly for son's birth. Carrier provided payments but retracted after two years, now hospital says we're responsible for $15k My son was born in September 2017 and was put on my insurance from birth. We received bills against my wife's insurance and I called in early 2018 to have it billed correctly. I cannot find a way to prove this and the hospital is saying it never happened. Now they've sent me a bill saying I owe what the incorrect insurance had paid 2 years later. Bother policies were under the same carrier so I did not realize it was still wrong. Now that they've retracted payment I'm finding out I'm  outside of the timeframe I'm able to have it claimed correctly. Do I have any recourse or am I stuck with this large bill?

"Landlord selling house while rent is in escrow Our landlord is attempting to sell the house while we have our rent in escrow. We live in Ohio and I put our rent into escrow cause they refuse to fix anything, per Ohio law we are supposed to be safe from eviction and retaliation.

It's only been a few days since the rent was put into escrow and they are trying to show the house to someone tomorrow. They literally replied to my mom's texts saying because we were asking for things to be fixed they couldn't put up with it and would be selling the house.

Edit: What can we do I know they don't have the right to evict us through retaliation cause our rents in escrow. But what I don't know is if they can show the home whenever they want? I also work from home so most days anything after 1pm would be impossible for me to allow people to just walk in whenever

If they are allowed to show our home multiple times per week when is that considered a heavey burden on us we have pets and live here how is that right?"

"Breaking Lease Early Hey Everyone,

Located in Tennessee. Long time lurker, first-time poster. My Fiancée and I are expecting to close on a home by the end of next week, this will leave us with 2 more months on our townhouse lease(ends 7/31/20). In the lease, we are able to pay $500 to terminate early, but it includes the following language “The Early Termination Of Lease requires a $500 Termination Fee and tenant is responsible for the property, utility connection, and upkeep of the property until it is rented by another tenant” sorry for the grammar and capitalization, that is verbatim from the lease agreement. My question is in regards to being responsible until the next tenant, they have multiple units that have sat vacant for months, are they really able to hold me responsible for these items 8-9 months after the termination for the lease? All in all, we are looking at saving $300 by not paying July’s full rent, if they are able to keep me on the hook for multiple months until they find a tenant I’d rather pay the full month's rent in July and be done with it. Let me know your thoughts! If I can save $300 I’d definitely like to, but I don’t want to be responsible for the townhome for potentially months."
"Mandatory for me, optional for others? The apartment I live at told me during the signing of my lease that they had optional on site extra storage space as an amenity. I thought cool feature but didn’t need it. When I went to sign the lease they told me it was actually mandatory because of the unit I’m in, I really liked the apartments and didn’t have time to “shop around” for other places and I signed the lease. Upon looking over the lease there’s nowhere that it says it’s mandatory. 

Now that my renewal is coming up, I’m wondering is this actually legal that it’s mandatory for some residents but optional for others? The lockers aren’t even physically attached to my unit or part of the floor plan, they’re at a separate location of the building. For reference there’s only 16 lockers in the 100 unit apartment.

"Home settlement between my parents So I'm 16, (can't really do anything myself) but I want to see if I can help my mom figure some stuff out. I live in Florida. Around the time I was born (I was born in 03, we're talking about 04) my parents bought a house. They were married, and both signed off on it. My father had (and continues to have) really shitty credit, so everything was put on my mom. Around 2ish years later, my parents divorced, and during the settlement, the house was split between the two. My mom continued to live in the house with my 3 brothers and myself, paying for it with the 3 jobs she worked to support all of us, while my father moved out and didn't do anything for us or for the home. He's never paid child support, and has openly told me that he never will. What I want to know is if there's any way that legally someone can see that he hasn't lived in the home and hasn't paid anything towards the home, and realize that my mom deserves the home. We're on the verge of losing the home because of economical problems (we bought another home that my stepdad pay's for, my brothers all moved out of the house to live on their own except one, who has to pay for everything except mortgage, etc.) and our only chance of cutting our losses is to sell of the house for a decent price and make whatever we can. The problem is that my father is asking for an ABSURDLY high price (home is worth around 200k because of it's condition, he's asking 280k minimum) and we all know it's because he doesn't give a shit if we lose it or not, he hasn't paid a dime for it. On top of all of this, even if we WERE to sell it off, he would get half of the money, which I see as utter bullshit. 

P.S. If this helps: he said he would sign on giving me ownership if my mom would sign off too, and idk if by me having ownership (or future ownership since I'm not old enough, idk how that work IANAL obviously lol) Thanks for all the help Reddit, I appreciate giving me your time  


TL;DR- Shitty father doesn't wanna sell off house that my mom's been paying for the last 14 years for a decent price. With house being on the verge of being lost due to economic problems, I'm wondering if any legal body (judge or something idk how that works) can see all of this and give my mom full ownership to do what she needs to cut our losses."

"Unable to get refund on online game purchase? So I play this game called Pokemon Go! on my phone.  I started playing it a year or two after it released so my characters were weak compared to most everyone elses.  After playing for a while I found that the game wasn't enjoyable because of how weak my characters were.  So I decided to purchase ""Downloadable Content"" or whatever you want to call it so that I could strengthen my characters faster and be able to enjoy playing the game.

Now that I'm able to get the full experience of playing the game, I'm beginning to notice that it has multiple issues (lagging, disconnecting, freezing, etc.).  I've noticed these problems long before the stay at home orders, so it's not just because of increased traffic.  The thing is I never played the game often enough to realize how often these issues occurred.  I always thought it was just my internet connection or that the game needed an update, but it's been constantly doing this for the past 3-4 months.  I switched phone carriers and I'm still having the same issues. Sometimes the game will tell me I have a weak connection when I have perfect reception.  Sometimes I can't play the game at all, recently it's started to tell me the game is unavailable and to try again later.  Some of these things have grown into a known issues apparently.  

At this point I'm tempted to just stop playing because i get more frustrated than entertained by it.  At the same time though I've put money into the game and I'd feel cheated if I stopped playing.  This is like paying for a gym membership then two days later 75% of their equipment breaks and there's such a long wait to use whatever is left that you practically can't even work out. Even worse, the gym won't refund your money. I've messaged the game developer multiple times and requested a refund on my money and their response is an apology for my inconvenience and a free item to use in the game and then they'll ask me if they answered all my questions... I might be able to screenshot their response if you want to see it.

Do I have any options here other than accepting being cheated and moving on?  I just want my money back or at least to be fairly compensated.  The free item they give me is disrespectful compared to the amount of money I've put into the game.  That free item isn't even equal to 1% of what I've spent on this game.  I'm not sure if it matters but I live in California."

"Unusual circumstances/Am I eligible for unemployment? [US, CO]
I interviewed and signed an offer with a company for a work from home position. The only thing left to do was a system set up but unfortunately it did not work on my brand new computer for some reason. 
I was supposed to start training next week, but because the system set up failed the HR person told me I need to send an email resigning, that way I could reapply in 6months.

But I quit my old job last month and bought a new computer and some home office supplies because I thought this was a sure thing, so this is hitting me pretty hard.

My partner then said that, the fact that they want me to send an email resigning sounds fishy, he said I might have the right to apply for unemployment, but I don’t know enough about the law to understand this.

"Previous landlord trying to take us for more than our security deposit Pennsylvania, USA.

TL;DR: We were forced to move out 5 days early so our realtor could walk through the house before she left the country. We didn't get out in time and didn't get to clean because they made us move early, and now our landlord kept our security deposit of $1325,  AND is trying to bill us for an additional $2563.51. we agree among ourselves that we should pay for the water bill, trash service, and two additional days of rent totaling $120.  But she also wants us to replace the toilet, tub, screens (that were never used once - ???), pay the cleaning fee, and labor charges which is insane. Isn't the security deposit supposed to cover any cleaning or replacement costs? The tub and the toilet are normal wear and tear.

Long story:
We were set to move out in early March of this year. My husband told our landlord via phone call back in October 2019 that we would be moving out in the first quarter of 2020. She said to bring it up again when we were ready to move out.

We gave our landlord the date of March 14th, and because of our new landlord wanting us to be in On the date that they did, it was actually only 45-day notice. Our lease states that it requires a 60-day written notice but she told us we didn't need to send a letter. That was our stupidity for listening. But it was via phone call. we don't have it in writing but we have a 40-minute call the day that we came out to view the new house. My husband called her on the drive home to tell her that we would be out by mid-march. 

We told her March 14th because that was the ideal day for us with our work schedules and with moving. Everything was fine, she said she was okay with a notice and agreed to March 14th.

Everything had been done through her realtor, Mary. Well Mary decided to go out of the country during that week and could not be present on March 14th for the final walk-through. Our landlord called us back and told us to move out by March 9th instead. she screamed at my husband and said that he was trying to scam her because he gave 45 day notice instead of 60 day notice. apparently when she called the realtor, the realtor flipped out about the 15-day difference which the landlord had verbally told us was fine.

  at this point we had been busting our asses to get out of the house by the 14th. Moving is expensive and we could not afford movers. We were already extending our moving truck a week longer than we had expected because we only have friends to help us move and we have a lot of stuff that was too valuable to throw out. my husband told her that moving it back to the 9th means that it would be a huge challenge for us and we weren't sure if we could get everything moved and cleaned.

At that point she said we should just work on having the house presentable by the 9th and then we could do the walk-through with the realtor, and then we can work on getting things out afterward. The realtor got back to her and said no, the house needs to be completely moved out of and cleaned before she would do a walk-through. but she could only do it on the 9th, because she was leaving for another country on the 10th.she would not do a walk-through on the 9th unless the house was empty. Well, there was no way without a miracle that the house would be empty on the night so she left for Peru. (She was stuck there in quarantine for weeks, lmfao).

Starting on the 9th my husband had daily phone calls with the landlord updating her on our progress.he told her everything that was still left and what we were still doing. We were working pretty much 8 a.m. to midnight, sometimes until 3 a.m., taking carloads and filling up the moving truck for the 45 minute round-trip to our new house. I had developed a major foot injury and could barely walk. My husband was so exhausted he came home and collapsed into bed every night. We were killing ourselves but we were doing what we had to do.

we had already started our tenancy at the new house March 1st and agreed to stay until the 14th so that we could move. We paid for half a month's rent through the 9th in March at the old house since we were technically still occupying the house. we even offered to pay until the 14th so we could continue to move but she said no, we had to be out by the 9th. We did our best until on the 11th, she called my husband and flipped out that we were breaking tenancy laws, we were squatting, we had to be out by midnight. So we literally grabbed our loads of things and had all of our neighbors take them and hold them in their garages and load up our cars. It was complete chaos for that last day but we got everything out of the house. All the cleaning that we wanted to do didn't get done.

Within 30 days of move out per the lease, we received the list of damages. She is keeping our security deposit.  But she wants to bill us for a bunch of things that are not the old tenant's responsibility. can she legally take us to court over more than $2,000 worth of what she claims are damages?

"Logging Overtime Hours Recently got tasked with taking on additional workload within the company. It started out not too bad but has ramped up in the past couple weeks with me having to stay on well past a normal work day in order to finish time-sensitive projects. 

I started keeping a spreadsheet of my hours including how long I take breaks so I can subtract that. I also live in Georgia and could not find anything regarding unauthorized overtime whereas other states did. I've notified my manager but thinking about emailing my GM at this point.

Any other advice on how I could handle this? 

Thanks!"
"I had to defend myself from a false citizens arrest. I got pepper sprayed, I'm scared I'm in Illinois. This didn't happen that long ago and I'm super freaked out still. I'm really scared.

I'm 16. I routinely walk late at night, it's something I've always done. I always walk from my house, through a public park, and onto a public trail. Some guy came out of his apartment overlooking the park yelling at my friend and I to stop. We kept walking but he came down and cornered us against a fence telling us we're under citizens arrest for trespassing. I'd never seen him before

I didn't tresspass anywhere. The parks doesn't have a closing time, the trail doesn't either, and it's reopened from the pandemic closures. I walked on public sidewalks to get there. He was on the phone with presumably 911 and also trying to keep us cornered. I tried to leave and he grabbed me by my neck and pepper sprayed my face. 

I couldn't see and I fought back until he let go. I didn't know how bad I hurt him or if I even got him but I ran away down the trail. 

My throat hurts from him grabbing it, im having triuble talking because of it. The pepper spray is burning my skin. It's not as bad in my eyes anymore. 

When I peeked off the trail from down the street a few minutes ago lots of police cars were at the park including the detective cars, and an ambulance was there too with fire trucks. 

I really am scared of going to jail. I didn't mean to hurt anyone, and I don't know how badly I hurt him. I've never gotten in trouble before. I don't know where my friend went. Help?!?"
"Real Estate Broker - Seller went around me do i have a claim? Hi all

In 2017 I was working on selling a mid-sized apartment building at roughly $15million.

I secured a buyer and put in an offer but then the owner refused to pay us a fee (I believe because he wanted to ""net"" a certain amount) and neglected to pursue the deal with our buyer. Shortly therafter then went into contract with another buyer but that buyer backed out.

Recently, I found out that he went back to my buyer about a year later, and my buyer did the deal with for a lower price than we had originally procured. Obviously the buyer never had any concern about paying use since we had never discussed it with him due to the fact that seller was expected to pay out commission

I have evidence that I introduced the buyer to the deal, Evidence that I showed him the building, Evidence of assembling all Due diligence items and connecting attorneys to draft to contract,

But no signed commission agreement.

Is this a claim worth pursuing? I have very powerful lawyers behind me

I am in NY STATE"

"(MN )consulting company has a 2 year contract with a penalty for breaking it- I've been furloughed. Is that time commitment at all affected? I am a consultant with a company that fills roles for companies that need them. They provided a 11 week training and find placement in exchange for a 27 month commitment at a scheduled pay rate. There is a penalty for early termination of this agreement for any reason (10k+), and its something everyone agreed to before starting the job. As of Monday, we are all being furloughed for 12 weeks. We qualify for unemployment, but when asked if we were allowed to find work on our own the response from management was that we could find part time work, but whenever they find us a client to consult for, we are still required by the 27 month contract to quit the work we found and take the consulting gig. My question is if being furloughed has any effect on the binding nature of the 27 month agreement or if we are able to avoid paying the penalty of early termination if I find work myself and want to stick with that full time job.  Currently trying to find the contract to find more explicit language, but this all happened very fast and I am unsure of the implications of any of this. Any advice welcome!

Edit: I do not think I am required to quit the work I found independently, but am required to fill the role that the consulting company finds for me."
Dealership or should I say stealership I bought my wife a car about two months ago. Which is awesome she deserves it for putting up with me. So anyways the car is used and I wanted to get it checked out by a shop just in case. I took it to the shop and it needs about 5k worth of work done to it. The warranty denied the claim because they said the damage was pre existing and the dealership should have fixed it before they sold it. Now the dealership is not working with me and I dont know what to do next. I feel bad for my wife she loves the car but she is stressing about it. I live in Las Vegas.

"[Tennessee] unemployment appeal advice former employer filed an appeal (not the employer I was laid off from) [Tennessee] former employer (not the one I was laid off from) is appealing my unemployment

I left an employer a year ago, took a new job and unfortunately was laid off due to the current situation. My past employer is now denying my unemployment (not the employer that laid me off)

I left this particular employer because I was constantly being cursed out being called a stupid, bleeping (insert F bomb) bleep (insert a word rhyming with witch) on a daily basis. This went on for 10 months before I couldn’t take it anymore even with the owner of the company sitting there that’s how one employee was allowed to talk to people and the owner did nothing to correct their behavior. 

5 days before I quit the owner of the company shot off fireworks directly behind me while I was outside on my break causing me to lose my hearing in both ears for 24 hours and still having hearing loss in my right ear a year later. I do have doctors documentation of this fact even though I didn’t file for workers comp. In fact when I said it messed up my hearing I was told to toughen up and shake it off.  

The constant stress of always walking on eggshells not wanting to get cussed out was causing me daily migraines, anxiety and depression.  I would literally come home and cry every night. It was taking a tremendous toll on my mental health. I also have an extremely painful autoimmune disease and the stress was causing repeated flares which resulted in significant amounts of pain and inflammation in all of my joints. It was taking a tremendous toll on me mentally, physically and emotionally. 

When I quit I had been screamed at and cursed out 3 times that day. I finally said enough is enough. I packed up my desk, clocked out and walked out. I got in my car and I drove off. I found another job less than a week later so I never filed for unemployment. In fact this is the first time I’ve ever been on unemployment so I’m really confused as to why my former employer was notified of my claim. 

When I was asked on the unemployment application on why I left this said employer I stated I left voluntarily and then they asked the reason and I stated due to working conditions. I felt like it was a very unsafe work place and I had no choice but to leave. It was clear the owner had no control over their employees and didn’t care. It was also clear the owner had no regard for their own actions and no concern when someone loses their sense of hearing due to their negligence. 

I also found out after I quit that in the handbook by failing to give a 2 week notice that I agreed to allow them to withhold my final paycheck which is illegal. I sent a formal demand letter and also called the US Dept of Labor who called them and told them to pay up. I got my final paycheck a week after I quit and 3 days after our regular pay date.  I feel like this should automatically disqualify their appeal because they are in violation of the FSLA and also forcing employees to forfeit their right to employment at will while allowing themselves to remain at will. It feels like indentured servitude not employment at this point. 

How worried do I have to be about this appeal? I feel like I left on grounds that were valid and any reasonable person would not accept the treatment I was receiving and so were other employees. Has anyone else been in similar situation? How did you handle it? Any advice anyone has would be greatly appreciated. Thanks y’all"

"I ordered maternity clothes almost 2 months ago that still haven't shipped. I won't be pregnant much longer. Is there anything I can do? I apologize if this is the wrong place and if so, please point me to the right sub if you can.


I ordered about $90 worth of maternity clothes 7 weeks ago. It said it could take up to 30 days to receive my order which I understood. But it's been just over 7 weeks now, and I'm still not getting answers. The company was advertised a ton on my FB (I know now not to order anything from Facebook ads, but their website seemed legit when I Googled it). I placed the order and paid through PayPal. The items I ordered were a dress for my shower (which I'm doing a virtual baby shower in 2 weeks), and some maternity dresses and pants to wear through the rest of my pregnancy.


I have messaged the company on FB, and their customer service email. The customer service email I've been going back and forth with for 2 weeks, they tell me the same thing each time ""the order has been shipped, the rest is up to the courtier, please track your package."" I was also informed these items shipped from the UK which is why they take longer (but none of this was stated on the website, and the website said up to 30 days to get your order). When I go to track my package, and it says the same thing it has said for over a month: ""Shipping label processed"" and then the rest is pending. It has 4 steps to go through and its still on step one of label processed. Also, the response I got seemed to he from someone's personal account email with a name on it. Their company messaged me back on FB and said they will look into it.. But I doubt that.


At this rate, I won't even be able to wear the shower dress I got for my shower, and I won't get to even wear any of the maternity clothes I bought because I won't be pregnant anymore or I'll be pregnant for maybe another 2 or 3 weeks when the items finally do arrive, if they ever do arrive. (Im about 7.5 months pregnant).


Is there anything that I can do? I know with PayPal you can message them if you don't receive your item, but since mine is still technically being shipped, I don't know if I qualify for that or anything. Any advice is appreciated."
"Listed a home for sale. Neighbors started dumping on the property and telling potential buyers it was a meth house. Property was not sold after a year of listing. Hello,

I'm wondering if I have any options here. Obviously right now courts aren't going to be processing something like this, but I'm trying to figure out if there's even anything here worth pursuing.

More than a year ago I listed a property for sale. I live in a different state so I can't really do much to keep an eye on it. While there was considerable interest in the property, there were no offers. Finally the listing expired.

During that time I had heard from another listing agent (the listing changed hands at one point at the agency) that it was possible there was someone squatting there. I called the Sheriff's office to have them go out there but never heard anything back and when I called back some days later no one seemed to know anything.

I just recently listed the home again with another agency. The agent went out and spoke with one of the neighbors, who told him that another neighbor had dumped all kinds of crap onto the property, old appliances, random trash, and had even burned trash on the property. At one point they also apparently dug a deep ditch across the driveway blocking access to the property. They said the neighbor had called the police at one point and they had come out and made them remove the appliances they had dumped over there, and I believe fill in the trench they had dug as well.

They also indicated that these people had spoken to anyone who came out to look at the house and told them it was a meth house and all kinds of other garbage, discouraging people from buying the place.

Almost immediately after listing the property again, I received an offer on it for substantially less than listing price.

I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here or if it's even something worth pursuing. This is a property in a rural area where even several acres with a home that isn't completely falling down will often sell for under 50k, so I wouldn't really expect damages to be anything spectacular.

Near as I can tell the neighbors who were doing this stuff are not the same as the people who submitted an offer. Interestingly however, the owner of the property where those neighbors live (I've no idea if it's rented out or not) as well as the people who submitted an offer for the property I am selling own a significant amount of property in the area. Near as I can tell they're different people, but between them they probably own at least half the properties in the area.

Curious what you all think I should do. We're selling the property anyway because we want it gone in spite of taking a substantial loss on it because we're a few states away and we never really wanted it to begin with, just kinda ended up with it.

Thanks!

"Non-uk citizen advice - landlord given notice Hi,

Really hoping someone here can help or point me in the right direction so I can get help.

My girlfriend (non-EU) has been living in the UK (London) for the past 8 years and has been self employed for the past 2/3 years. She has an 8 year old son who was born in the UK and is a resident.

Since the Coronavirus she has been unable to work and therefore unable to pay rent. Today, her landlord gave her notice that she has to move out by August the 3rd.

She has no income to pay rent. She has applied for universal credit but this was denied because her visa has a restriction on receiving public funds. Her appeal was also denied.

She's now applied to have this restriction removed but we have no idea when she'll hear back and if she will be successful. If not, then she could be homeless with her 8 year old son.

Is there anything she can do in her situation? It seems crazy to me that she has paid taxes etc since she's been here but as soon as she's in need, the government won't help.

I don't have any idea about the legalities in this sort of situation hence my post here.

Thanks in advance."

Others are throughout the U.S. There is an existing website that does the same thing but I am more broad. So that website fits into one category on my site basically. I pulled the information of those businesses off that site and added them to my site. I then began to email the business owners and tell them that I added them to my site. I emailed a little over 100 of them. A few businesses claimed their listing on my site and a couple people called me and told me that they were fine with it. Most people didn’t answer

One guy replied with me and basically told me it would never work etc but we sent about 10 emails back and forth. Then, he told me to completely remove his information within three days or he will “pursue legal satisfaction both civil and criminal.” He said that I have violated state and federal law and that I plagiarized his work.

"I was served a restraining order and forced to leave my apartment. How to get my belongings and pet back ASAP? 
Location: Portland, Oregon U.S. 

Hi I really need some advice here. I’ll try to give out as much as details as possible without making this post too long. 

Me and my now ex-bf signed an apartment lease together a few month ago but then things went down hill. We’ve been sleeping separately (him in the bedroom me on the living room floor) for a couple months now.  We had an physical argument last month; he was upset about something I said so he threw plates and bowels at me while I was sitting down, one actually hit my forehead, thenI got up and slapped him. 

A few weeks ago he told me that he would like to break the lease but I was out of the job at the time so I refused. 

He went and filed a restraining order against me and I was asked to leave my apartment in the middle of the night. I had only 15 mins to packed my things so I left with only a backpack. 

I’ve requested a contest hearing by mail, it’s been 7 days and I haven’t heard anything from court. 

I really need to get the rest of my belongings back including my computer and my pet rabbit. (The rabbit is mine, wasn’t a shared pet). 

The apartment rent was due yesterday and I know he was planning on moving out before all these happened so I doubt that he would continually/able to pays rent by himself.

Since he listed the apartment address as his “safe address”, will I be able to legally retrieve my belongings AFTER he moved out? 

If not, will it be ok if I sent movers or friends to the apartment to pack up my things for me? (After he moved out, of course) 

How long should I expect to be able to look up my hearing date online? I’ve try to called the court clerk number everyday but they never pick up. 

i barely started my new job so I can’t afford to hire an attorney. And if I want a second stand-by from sheriffs I would have to pay expensive fee for that which I don’t have... 

Sorry if i seemed everywhere. Im just lost and don’t know what to do. I really miss my pet bunny."

I realize it isn't as severe an issue as most posts here, but I wondered if I was violating the law because of how they served me alcohol. Obviously I drove home before I drank any, but I have to assume even a completely full togo cup of a mixed drink counts as an open container, but the law isn't perfectly clear to me. If it is legal, I would love to support a great, local business this way (and of course enjoy their delicious drinks).edit for clarification: They are now allowed to sell drinks in ""pre-packaged containers"" and it does not change open container laws in regards to driving, at least as far as I have read.  
Edit: In regards to my question, I suppose it boils down to ""am I legally at risk for driving with a mixed drink in a standard togo cup in Ohio, even if I drink none of it?""

* If someone has impaired vision, do they have to inform their driving instructor by law
* Are there any special circumstances where said person isn't required to mention their impairment of vision
* If the person does continue their lessons without informing their instructor can this be used as evidence to attempt insurance fraud
* If a person is required to inform the DVLA of their vision impairment, when are they required to do so (*eg. Prior to lessons, prior to test, prior to insurance claim*)
* In the example of someone being completely blind in one eye, what challenges would they face getting their license, is this an issue or is it possible? Does it need to be mentioned at any of the above mentioned \[points\] of learning?

I want to preemptively apologizing for my actions in the following story. I made several really shitty life choices after my fiancé died and I was a mess. I know this is a long shot but here it goes.  

I read: “Contract law also holds that a contract made by an intoxicated person is voidable, as the person was incompetent at the time the contract was formed.”
So I’m trying to understand my situation would 
be considered under this. 

Long story:

It’s been almost a year since I signed papers to sell my home in Oregon. I was in foreclosure and approaching the cutoff date and desperately trying to fix up my house to sell it. 
I had a realtor put it on the market. The house was put on the market for about $330,000. I only owed $90,000. 
Again I was desperate because the impending foreclosure. I was drinking heavily and in a very very bad mental state. 

Preemptive apologies for my following actions:
I found a room to rent on Craigslist while planning to sell. I get raped there while drunk. 
I leave the house and get a dui. 

I go to the sobering center for the night, get picked up by the realtor’s worker and he takes me to sign the papers. She tells me then she could only get $120,000. And by now we wouldn’t have time to stall foreclosure (I had done this previously with the owner- it was a private mortgage). 

So I was in withdrawals from being at the sobering center and detoxing, so I immediately had to get alcohol into my system so I could even sign the papers. 

I don’t remember anything about it really. I agreed to half of what she originally put it on the market for. She said I’d loose it otherwise and it was the best she could do. 

I stayed drunk for a few days while waiting to get into a rehab. Yes, I was that physically dependent I was in danger of DT’s if I didn’t drink. 

So now, clean and sober for many months- and this story came up and I was told that because I shouldn’t have signed because of my mental state- essentially mentally unfit at the time. 
I can show in documents the date of arrest and signing were within 18 hours. 

Again, I know it’s a long shot, but sober me hates everything that happened and I’m just praying there is anything I can do. I lost my moms retirement money and my life savings over this situation. 

So please if there’s even the slightest possibility I can do anything I will.

This is a potential situation I am facing, but not sure if I’m in the right area. I’m in the US, state is Pennsylvania. 

Right before covid-19 became what it is today, I took a job with a vet clinic as a receptionist, one perk is that through studying and working with the vets (basically the vet has to watch you/sign off on doing x, y, and z so many times) you can eventually become like a “vet assistant” and can do more and get raises. The vet is only at our location 2x weekly, and I’m only there one of those days (I’m at my other job the other day that we have a vet in house). It’s probably important to note that this is a wellness center. 

Pre-shutdown, I worked a total of two days: my first one was me getting thrown in with the vet (also the day we found out we were getting shutdown since we’re not considered essential), and the next day was actually us closing down our room. We were told that we would get paid for the first two weeks, and would hear from the company weekly after that about money. I have heard from my boss once, and it was just a general check in. Turns out, we are still getting paid, however not at full rate. We’ve been on lockdown for a while now and I am still getting paid.... however, in doing a lot of thinking, I’m realizing I may not want to go back to this job when the world opens back up. Would there be any legal ramifications of taking the money that I’m getting paid now, and then quitting in a couple of weeks? Would I have to return the money or could I get sued for cashing the checks or anything? This is all aside from the moral debate I’m facing, but that’s for a different sub. (Also probably important to note that I have no way of getting my contracts or anything that I signed until we open again, so I’m not sure what was in there that I signed. I wasn’t intending on quitting, job sounded great, but I know myself pretty well and I struggled with the vet who typically comes to us, and I.... I just am not sure this is the right fit for me. I also don’t want to run into any legal issues though, ideally!)

Thanks, and I’m looking forward to hearing responses to this!"

"Federal employment screening. SF-85 I've have worked two jobs at the same time in the past. I'm currently filling out an SF-85 that requires a NACI Tier 1 background check for U.S. federal employment through a contractor.

How do I list the two simultaneous jobs in a way that it wont raise issues when the investigator looks at the form?

I'm afraid that the overlapping dates will raise alarms when the investigator sees that!"
"Can my employer withhold my tips due to the ppp loan? My employer applied for the ppp loan and was approved on April 21. My employer reached out to us stating that we would be considered employed and that we would be getting paid a temporary base amount for the following 8 weeks. Cool! Now that restaurants are allowed to open, we are scheduled to open tomorrow evening. Even cooler. I am a bartender and I normally get paid based on my hourly and my tips, of course. However, because we are being paid that “certain” amount with the ppp loan, my employer said that they would be withholding my tips from me. Is this even legal? Btw, I live in Houston, TX."
"Washington DC: Trying to contest a late fee for a ticket, DMV will not even view correspondence Back in December, I received a speeding ticket from DC for $300. The ticket was mailed on the 16th, and arrived at my door on the 23rd. The due date it gave me was the 10th, and I mailed the ticket on the 7th (didn't have access to my checkbook sooner).   


A couple weeks later I received a late fee for another 300 dollars from DC. I was willing to pay the ticket but I would not pay the late fee because I sent the payment on time. I called in to dispute the fee and from what the person on the other end told me, it takes 2-3 weeks for them to process a payment once received, and if the check isn't processed by the deadline, even if they have it, that is still considered late. Based on when the ticket arrived, even if I had mailed it immediately, it would not have processed in time due to the holiday.   


I sent back the check with a letter explaining that I will admit fault and pay the initial fine, but I wanted to dispute the late fee for the reasons above. That was back in mid-February or early March, and I had assumed that was the end of it.   


Today I got another letter from the DMV demanding that 300, and in that letter they state that because I paid, that is an admission of the violation and my correspondence was not even looked at.   


I tried calling the number they provided and was told the same thing. How should I go about getting this bogus fee dismissed? If I can avoid losing 300 bucks I would prefer not to."
"House raided as a result of a false claim by a lying witness. My friends House got raided by feds on about 1 year ago. Some small stuff for personal use was found.but enough for jail time

 Accusers claim that my friend tried to get them to sell for them. But it was a lie.  never had any contact with them. Never even met them.

My friend has the accusers on camera trying to steal from my friends car and house.

 also they have many messages from other people with proof asking who asking who these accusers are because they live in my friends neighbourhood.

Does this sound like a good oppertunity for a subpoena or anything?

"Camper wants trailer back after abandoning it, already sold to someone else. My parents own a camping resort with trailers. we had some people bring a trailer stayed for a month or two then left. They left everything clothes ,dishes ,fishing equipment etc.

It’s been around 5 years since this happened, we sold the trailer to someone else last year. 

last year they guy who owned it said he didn’t have the money to pay the yearly fee and asked if he could work to pay it off but we declined since he didn’t pay for the past years before or storage and we’ve had no contact besides that. 

Yesterday he called the cops and they came to our house but i wasn’t around and they talked to my dad. I don’t think anything super important was said or anything that could solve the issue or my dad probably would have told me.

i’m wondering if there’s anyway they can sue us. i’ve been googling stuff to see if there’s laws about this but it’s just been tenant laws and i’m not sure if they apply here.

Edit: This is in ontario canada. We asked them if they were coming back or if they were going to pay but they never answered the email. Yearly fee is $2,600 storage is $1,000.

My dad owns the trailer park. People come in with trailers they pay a yearly fee. If they don’t pay the yearly fee then they take the trailer and leave. If they don’t take the trailer we do. We have sings posted up about this but no contracts. The guy who wants his trailer back wants it back because the collector people from the bank are coming and he doesn’t have money to pay them back."
"Paid sick leave (corona, not in mega thread) I was potentially exposed to corona virus and my work told me I have to take time off work until my test results are in. 

Are they required to pay me? 

I’m not sick or anything and the person who thought they had corona just tested negative. My work still won’t let me come back until my results are in but that’s another 3-4 days. 

Regardless of law, should I even ask to be paid or ask if I’m getting paid? 


Thanks for the help guys!"
"Can landlord require that I kennel my dog when I leave the house? - IOWA I'm moving up to Iowa in a month and am in the process of looking for a home for me, my fiance, and our 1 cat and 1 dog. I have a letter from my therapist stating they are both emotional support animals.

We found a townhome we really like. We took a virtual tour and want to put in an application. But the realtor told us that their leasing company requires that we kennel our dog whenever we leave the house. I've never heard of this before and honestly don't feel comfortable doing this. Our dog is great, but she gets insanely anxious when she's locked in a kennel, and I'm worried she may hurt herself.
Is this standard for landlords to put in their leases? How is it enforced?

Grateful for any advice:)"
"[CA, USA] Moving out next year. Housemates (two people) asked me to sign next year's housing and agreed to find a housemate for me; they also verbally agreed that if they couldn't find one, they will not have me share the rent. I did sign the lease with them in February, but now I'm a bit worried... My current rental agreement will end by the end of August this year. Since I will be moving out, there's no reason for me to stay and continue the lease. However, my housemates (two in total) are planning to stay and asked me to sign the lease next year with them because they couldn't find a housemate yet and the lease agreement requires three people. I signed the lease in February because they agreed to be responsible for all rents if they cannot find a housemate. However, one of the housemates now seems to be in some sort of financial difficulty since he has already borrowed $2K from me to pay the rent for the last two months, and I am starting to worry that they might take back what they said and ask me to pay the rent if they cannot find a new housemate especially with what's currently going on with COVID. I know this sounds very stupid of me to sign a lease like this, but they are international students which made me believe they should be doing financially well and paying 50% extra rent not being a problem for them.

Assuming the worst situation where they take back what they agreed on and ask me to pay rents for the next whole year, my question is that what I should do right now to prepare? Am I SOL because I already signed the lease and have no legal documentation of the verbal agreement? I do have text messages where we informally talked about the verbal agreement on they paying the rent, so how heavy does this carry in a legal sense? Should I discuss with them about signing some sort of SOF?

Also, I'm not sure if it matters, but I have been applying to graduate schools since last November. Will this be some sort of proof that will help me show that I have no intention of staying here and therefore makes ""my story"" more believable if we get into a lawsuit?

Thanks in advance."
Mom never transferred inherited house to her name and now property has 4 years of delinquent taxes. So I was doing some research and I discovered that my mom has been delinquent on her property taxes.  She inherited the house and has the notarized paperwork.  But she never fully transferred it to her name.  I feel out of my depth and I'm not sure where to begin to help her.  No one at the delinquent tax bureau has returned any of my calls.  I would like to get her on a structured payment plan?  Should I get an attorney?
"My Dog Passed Away Due to Pharmacy's Mistake I'm am devastated to be writing this sentence but my dog passed away on Monday. She was the best dog and I loved her more than anything. Her vet prescribed her a steroid and another drug to help with the symptoms of her Cushing’s disease. The vet prescribed a 1mg dose of the steroid but Walgreens Pharmacy dispensed a 10mg dose. So my dog was receiving 10x the dose she should have received which caused her to develop a severe case of pancreatitis that she was unable to recover from. Walgreens has admitted fault and offered to pay her vet bills ($6000) which is not nearly enough to fill the hole in my heart. I'm not sure how to proceed. Should I contact a lawyer to have them work out a settlement? I don't want her death swept under the rug and I definitely don't want this to happen to anyone else.

TLDR: Walgreen's killed my dog"
"(PA) SO’s landlord won’t let her break lease without charging family friends realtor fee, which isn’t in the lease Hi,

My girlfriend lives in a cheap building in Germantown (philly). There are now roaches she kills daily, about 2 dozen ants, carpet beetles (she doesn’t have carpets), and random other bugs. In all, she has to kill or trap about 30 bugs a day. She has a skylight that’s destroyed and leaks a large amount every time it rains onto her coffee table (usually about half a pot of water each time). She’s been contacting maintenance for months and they’re barely responsive. The landlord (who owns 100 properties) had his nephew come in and ‘exterminate’ by setting up glue traps and said he’d come back once a month. 

She emailed this week and said she wanted out of the lease. They gave significant blow back, saying they had changes in their company, then said she’d have to find someone to replace her, then said they can’t replace her til after covid. Now they emailed and said their family friend, who is a realtor, will charge her one months rent to break the lease, as that is his going fee and he is ‘very good.’ They said in the first year if a tenant leaves, they charge this fee, but after the first year the fee is waived. There is nothing I can see stating this in the lease. They’re now sending hostile emails to her regular questions like today her water was turned off and when she asked, they sent an aggressive email that the city did it for the whole block and she should be thankful. 

Any advice would be appreciated!"
"Driving with a suspended license??? Ok so my license isn’t really suspended, I’m allowed to go to work, school, grocery stores, church, and medical appointments.

"Another tip pool question in California After being laid off from my job bar tending at a popular Mexican restaurant, I have been brought back to make to go drinks and help with handling the to go orders. Without telling anybody, they changed the tip out policy on Cinco De Mayo (busiest day of the year). Instead of splitting the tips evenly between the front of the house employees, they decided to tip everybody who worked. This resulted in the FOH only receiving 1/3 of the tips. 

I'm all for tipping the kitchen out, but an even share doesn't seem fair considering there were twice as many of them working. In addition to tipping the kitchen out 2/3 of the tips, they just split the tips evenly for everybody. This means that people who worked 4.5 hours got the same tips as people who worked 8+ hours.  I was told by my boss that there aren't any restrictions on tip pools right now because of COVID-19, but everything I find online says that while tip pools are legal, those who provide more service should get a larger share. Even if we tip the kitchen equally, shouldn't there be an obligation to at least give those who worked longer more of the tips?

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't want to come off as one of those FOH employees who takes the kitchen for granted, or can't be a team player, but this definitely isn't fair. I guess my question is, is it legal?"
"[TX] - What counts as an ""Asset"" as far as the courts are concerned? I am filling out an ""Application for Court Appointed Attorney With Affidavit and Order"" form. It's having me list a breakdown of expenses, liabilities, and assets. Under assets there's stuff like Bank Accounts and Vehicle Value and Stocks and Jewelry and Other. What counts as Other?

I have a lot of stuff. Most of it isn't worth too much. I have no idea how much I would get if I sold it all. If I sold it locally I would get a lot less than if I sold each of my possessions on Ebay or something, which would be a huge task in itself. I don't know if the court is looking for that number or something else?

Any help or insight is appreciated."
"Lab test results difficult to get Struggling to get blood test results from a particular lab. They say I have to get them from my doctor or use their portal to request them. When I use their portal, it is always broken. My phone calls to their support line result in them saying ""we'll look into the problem and get back to you."" They never get back to me. Aren't they required by law to give me the results WITHOUT having to go to my doctor? I can ask my doctor but it's more of a principle thing. It's worth it to me to hire a lawyer to rattle their cage. Are there lawyers who would do that? What kind of fees would they normally charge for that?"
"[MO] Denied unemployment for quitting my job to undergo substance abuse treatment tldr; Quit my job because I wasn’t eligible for FMLA and went to rehab. Denied unemployment for quitting my job. Should I file an appeal?

In March of this year I decided, at the behest of my therapist, to enter a 30-day residential treatment program for substance abuse and other underlying mental health disorders. I was working at a large-scale department store and had already taken two a two-week “mental health” leave, but my counselor assured me that I could file for Family and Medical Leave and keep my position held. It turned out, however, that I was 30 days shy of being employed there to be eligible, so I explained my situation to a manager, resigned my position, and left for inpatient. 

Then two weeks into treatment, shutdowns began, me and my rehab buddies were sent home, and the retailer I worked for closed its doors before the mall it was housed in did. 

To complicate matters, my housemate who chauffeurs me to appointments, etc. is on dialysis, so hasn’t been all too keen on me working with the public just yet, though I am able and available. So I applied for unemployment on April 9, hoping to offer some help and continue paying my bills. 

I understand that the state is inundated with claims at the moment, but I’ve received nothing from them aside from the initial message that my claim was accepted. I’ve been able to request payment each week, but haven’t received any money. The website has only shown that there’s been a “pending issue”, so I finally called today and learned that I’ve been denied for quitting my job. 

I was getting ready to write my appeals letter, but before I do, I wanted to ask if I’m barking up the wrong tree. Should I have done something differently (legally speaking)? Should I continue waiting for correspondence, or do I need to send receipts of treatment bills? And mostly, so I have the right to appeal?

Thanks in advance."

"What happens if a convicted felon commit a petty theft crime? Okay so. My close friend (as I thought) Let’s call him Mike - somewhat had an access to my Cashapp account on his phone under my emails and everything. He got his two roommates Linda and Noah  (make-up names) who are living in the same house who are both apparently convicted felons and have served prison/jail time. On my bank statements, Linda’s full name is right there clearly with Mike’s “fake Cashapp name”. When I first saw these statements, I knew something was wrong so I contacted Mike but he denied strongly and even showed his roommates saying they did not know anything about it. He said someone had an access to his account too but couldn’t give the proof of it. This happened last weekend. I have reported to my bank and Cashapp everything but still haven’t received any response from them. It has been a week until now. 

So I did a lot and a lot of self research and discovered many evidences. I went in my google account to check the device histories of my emails where Cashapp was required to sign in for the code. They can’t get the code until they have an access to my emails and they had an access to it on their phones. 
 I saw the registered device and tracked it’s IP address. It matched their location and phone carriers. I have printed all evidences, including the texts between me and Mike. He even got his two friends from other states to “request” and “pay” for him from my account. I have contacted them but one of them only replied saying they did not know. Her credit card was linked to my other email. (There were two Cashapp accounts that were linked to my TWO emails) One was under my name and one was with the made-up username. I have been backing and forth with Mike, with him saying a lot of threats like I’m not welcomed to their house if I thought it was them. Saying that I’m dumbass and stupid. Saying I’m a bad friend for asking around. Telling me that I need to do my homework and all that. BUT that’s what I’ve been doing smh and I even screen recorded our FaceTime conversation which was 19 minutes without him knowing a couple of days. He showed a lot of anger in it and said a lot of OBVIOUS LIES saying that Linda doesn’t have a cashapp account or even a phone. He even said he regularly scams people in the video. I was so glad that I screen recorded it just in case. Today, I am so heartbroken and so angry. I wanted to pull up to their house so bad but am afraid for my safety knowing they have guns in their house. Should I also report the guns? These guns could be illegal - considering Linda have served jail time and Noah is a convicted felon. This is in Texas. Today I am gonna report to the police about this but I would like some advices. I know this is a complicated situation and I really thought Mike was my good friend but I guess not. What will the police do in this kind of case? Especially if I have solid evidences enough for them to get an arrest warrant? I am going to press charges on all three and possibly other two from other states too but I need to know what might happen. Also - what kind of charges should they face in this case? It’s clearly theft but I feel like there’s a lot more like identity theft, scamming people etc.

A total of $281 was stolen."

"[KS] Could I claim damage after someone hit my rental car? On early January, my rental car was rear ended by a high schooler. This is a rental car, so rental car company did deal directly with high schooler's insurance company (State Farm) for vehicle damage claim. State Farm did resolve the claim with the rental car company.

My company dispatched me to this town for work for only a few months. Because of this, I did not drive my own vehicle but do long term rentals at this town (my employer will not reimburse rental cost). After this rental vehicle was damaged, I did need to rent another car until I finished my work assignment. In this process, I have to spend a few hours by: (1) The rental car company will only accept damaged vehicle in their airport location because they will only do inspection at airport location. I spent approximately 3 hours returning the vehicle to the airport and handling all paperwork. (2) After I submit the paperwork, I did communicate with rental car company's claim department several times about this claim including sending all documentations to them and their requests. (3)  I did rent another vehicle from rental car company.

I do want to submit a claim to State Farm for like 2-week car rental reimbursement and some reimbursement on time spent on handling the claim. However, I feel like my argument is not strong. I am worrying that State Farm will claim that this is a rental car, not your own car, you do not suffer any loss of use. You are not eligible for rental reimbursement. If I tell them that my vehicle is in somewhere else, they may claim that your work will need a vehicle anyway, we will not reimburse your cost. I am also afraid that State Farm will claim that you spent time handling this claim because your rental car company require you to do so, not State Farm. State Farm has no obligation to reimburse your time spent on this. Here is my question: **What is a reasonable claim/rationale I can establish on this matter because I did spend time and efforts on this matter? What kind of strong argument I can bring to State Farm in order to valid the claim?  I feel like I am entitled to some reimbursement.**"
"Ex-wife took my 6 month old back to her country, refused to let me contact her, I stopped giving her child support and now she lives in MD for the last 3 years, child is now 14, I want to initiate contact, no idea what to do. Met overseas, got married way too young, wife got pregnant, didn't work out and she went back home temporarily to get over the divorce, be in her environment and recharge with the agreement she would come back to the States in six months.

She did come back and try to make it work with a new job etc, but it didn't last and she moved back overseas.  I was able to see my child once during all of this for an hour when she was about 18 months old.

Wife did get full custody of my daughter in NC with state ordered visitation rights and I agreed to pay $350 a month in child support (I was young and broke and that was 25% of what I made at the time).

She said it was too difficult to explain to my child why she didn't have a father in her life when I could not afford to visit regularly by flying overseas quarterly as a broke college student.  Her idea was then to cut me off entirely from my child.  I had no money and no legal recourse and the country she was in would not have been cooperative.  This went on for years.  

I was paying child support regularly but after she cut me off I refused (she was from a very well-off family, my money had no impact). 10 years later the Ex-wife is now living in MD, remarried and prior to her moving she contacted me about 5 years ago, asking if I was interested in seeing my daughter as they were touring the US that summer.  I was ecstatic and then she simply told me my daughter hated me and had no interest.  She was 9 and I hadn't seen her in person in years and not allowed to speak to her, how could she hate me?  I felt her Mom set that up so I flipped out, cussed her out and we haven't spoken since.

I can tell by her twitter feed and pics where they live, where my kid goes to school and I see that she has a nice life.  I absolutely love this kid regardless and want to be a Dad in anyway I can but I know my ex will start a war if I try to initiate any contact.  Being that I haven't paid child support in years as she cut me off entirely while my broke ass was paying, I wonder if I attempt to contact my child if she will sue for that or have me thrown in jail.

I want to be a part of this kid's life but don't want to ruin her life by going full scorched-earth with her mother in a war that would likely end around the time she turns 18.

I have no idea what to do but I want her to know I love her and she has a family and grandparents that miss her."
"Was in a car accident where I was at fault, contacted by the injured party's Personal Injury Lawyer I'm in California (LA County,) and was in a pretty bad car accident on April 20th. There were 3 parties involved, but I haven't heard from a representative of the third party yet (I hope that I don't ever, but it could happen), only the second. (For ease of reading I'll say P2 and P3)

I won't go into the gruesome details, my car collided with P2's and then was pushed into P3's. P2 (driver and his father) were both taken to the hospital immediately. P3 and everyone in my vehicle weren't hospitalized. All 3 cars were towed away, mine was totaled. Both P2 and P3 have insurance (Progressive and State general respectively), but I have none, and I'm a 20/yo college student without a job (now that I don't have a car). I also don't have a license but I do have a learner's permit, and had a licensed driver with me in the car. (That should have stopped me from getting a VC 12500 citation, but there's another subreddit dedicated to fighting wrongful tickets.)

The police report has some flawed information, but the fact that i was at fault is true. I was contacted by P2's Personal Injury Lawyer yesterday, and she said she had received the report but then immediately asked me what kind of insurance I have. It states clearly on the report that I have none. I told her I couldn't talk right then. Why would she ask me to say it out loud if she already knew?

I'd hate to drag this all out if P2 just wants money for the hospital bills his insurance wouldn't give him or something, but I'm scared, I've never even been to court as an adult, and I highly doubt I could afford a private lawyer on TOP OF whatever money P2'll try to get out of me.

Reading up on it, the state of California *typically* doesn't allow people public defenders for personal injury cases. I have tried calling the public defender's office, but they don't allow you to seek consul of any sort until you've actually gone to court and been assigned a defender (your arraignment, I was told).  On top of this, everything in my county is closed, I'm pretty sure all California courts are as well, so I don't even know *when* we would go to court if they're really going to try to sue money out of me (I have half a stimulus check to last me the summer, if that tells you anything) I guess my questions are,

1. Should I keep trying to find free consul somehow, before I say anything to this lawyer?
2. Is she even allowed to call me again if I told her I'd call her back?
3. If I don't have a court date even set yet, would hiring a private lawyer in this type of case cost thousands? (like I said, no income.. half a stim check in my savings.)
4. is it going to make things worse the longer I wait to answer the lawyer's questions? Even if she already knows the answer to the ones regarding information on the police report?"
"A restraining order in question. Okay, I've heard a rumor through a drunk friend of my ex. He was explaining she was talking with her co workers about it. I'm unsure if she would have any grounds by which to enforce this rule. Most of my contact to her has been silent for this and last month about halfway through it I decided to stop trying to contact her. I was finally accepting that she just didn't want to talk. Now this was always done through Facebook messenger and I was never threatening her well being or health. I stated I wanted a civil attitude to when I came to get my things. Originally though I stated we were at a disagreement about her having my cat but I've accepted the loss. The last message I sent her was personal and spoke about her mistreatment to me and being completely uncivil. I stated why I wanted to go to the city she lived in and to live on my own and do my own thing. I even stated I felt no emotion towards her. That my emotions were around the older version of her and that I knew they were misguided in every way so I wanted nothing to do with her. I haven't spoken since. That was two days ago. The 3rd day ago the group chat where we last spoke was to explain that I was coming and I even said the day and the hour I would be there and for my ex to decide if she wanted to be there or for her to not be there. I made it clear my only objective were my belongings. Does she have anything on me? As in something to really want this? I personally would rather not have to deal with a restraining order case especially since I am not sure if I want to live in that city long term anyways."
"First time renter advice? (Michigan) My friend signed a lease that started on May 1st. The land lord needed to get some more work done, and has been pushing back the move in date slowly and taking the rent down incrementally. 

It is now a full week after the move in date, and our friend has been couch surfing here, waiting for the land lord to give them the go ahead. 

Finally, they got the go ahead that Friday (today) was the day they could move in and so she moved her stuff into her car and was preparing to move in today. 

Instead, the land lord said that there is still work being done, and that the kitchen is still off limits, and that the upstairs should be left alone until the floors are finished drying. 

My friend called them out and said that this is just not acceptable. That this is unprofessional, and if they are paying for May 7th, that they should be able to use the entire house, at least a full week after the least was started. 

The land lord became extremely unprofessional and started personally insulting her, and threatens to revoke the lease if she continued “complaining” about the situation. 

Is there anything she can do?"
"Would it be illegal to doordash at 17? The requirements are 18 years old. I need a side hustle though because I graduated school early and now have nothing to do during the day. Would it be illegal for me to say I was 18 and drive for them?

I live in Oregon."
"Trying to cancel my amusement park membership NY. Amusement parks are closed (obviously). I'm unable to cancel the membership online and their main business office is closed. It directs me to a corporate center which has me on hold for about an hour before hanging up and asking me to try again later.

I tried arguing with a chat bot about cancelling, but was told that I'd committed to 12 months for the membership so would have to continue payments.

The company is offering to pause memberships until they reopen, but I'm unable to do that online 

If I call my credit card company and have them block the transaction, can I be charged late fees and forced to pay?"

It's not her dog, I gave no permission, and that dog is so damn expensive I mean why would she do this to him."
"Neighbor is driving me up the (shared) wall I partially need some kind of legal advice and partially just a sanity check. If I’m just being too petty, please tell me that. 

This all started Summer/Fall of 2019, which is weird because I know this guy has been our neighbor for longer. I have also been pregnant since early September and don’t know what factor that plays (more on that later).

Back story/first interaction is long, but provides a somewhat important backdrop. My husband and I are in our 20s, quiet, and keep to ourselves. On top of that, I started online school June 2019 and find that even music and background tv distract me when I have to focus, so I keep our apartment kind of radio silent intentionally during my schooling. Our neighbor however is a very loud and generally unbothered person in general, he smokes and it reeks in our closets and bathroom which have shared walls, he is constantly hacking up a lung and spitting which I hear all the time, his little dog yaps often, he sometimes goes out to his truck and just revs it late at night with his bright headlights shining in our window, but on top of all of that he plays his tv all day every day at a volume where I can tell what he’s watching from my living room which is on the other side of the apartment from the shared wall, and his tv is also on the far side from the shared wall. 

Late fall 2019 it became too much, he had his door open, tv blasting into the breezeway and I could easily understand every word from his tv for over an hour while I was trying to focus on a paper. I considered just calling the police because I didn’t know him or how he would react, it was past 10pm, and I was home alone, but that felt like an overreaction and I hadn’t even given him a chance so I risked it and went over. He’s a 53 year old man and immediately started making excuses about commercials being loud, and said “What are you trying to go to bed or something?” (Yes.) I tried to be as nice but assertive as possible that commercials were not the problem (I normally just back down in situations like this). I said, “I’m not asking you to turn it off or to a volume where you can’t hear it, but it’s incredibly loud in my apartment, I’ve been hearing it for months, I’m just finally trying to nicely ask you to turn it down a couple notches”. He just acted bewildered I could hear it, turned it down drastically (still loud though to me in the same room as the tv) and said, “Can you hear this??” and I said, “Well...yeah, but if you can’t, you can turn it up, I was just honestly asking for you to turn it down like 2.” He kind of let up, did what I asked, and told me to test it out and let him know. I could still hear it but it was better so I told him that, thanked him, and appreciated that we came to somewhat of a compromise. Then he came over 5 minutes later and knocked on my door... He again asked if I could still hear it and I said “Well it’s a lot better, I do appreciate you turning it down” and then he started asking if we were here for good. Our doormat is another state flag (where we’re from), but I thought he was asking about this apartment specifically and answered that we’ve lived here for 2.5 years. So he asked, “Why don’t you buy a house?” and I said, “Uhh, we’ve got our reasons, why don’t you buy a house?” (probably sounds more aggressive than it was, I was just annoyed that my asking this man I don’t know to turn it down a bit is getting me grilled on major life decisions at 10pm, pregnant, home alone). He started to give me his divorce/home ownership story, but I kept it short and just said “Hey again, I appreciate it, have a good night.” 

Months go by, mostly no problems, but the tv gradually gets louder again. My husband keeps telling me it’s not a big deal, which in a way he’s right (he also isn’t able to hear it as well for some reason, which is why I wonder if pregnancy has made my ears extra sensitive) but it really gets to me that I can’t have a quiet living environment. This is our living space that we pay for, I don’t care what he does, but I don’t want to hear it. So I leave a note on his door, “Hey, we can hear your tv again every day, could you just bump it back down a couple? Thanks! :) -apt #.” He comes over as we’re on our way out to dinner the next night and asks us to come over, has his tv on a very reasonable volume, and says “You can hear this??” So I said, “This? No! I actually haven’t heard anything all day, but usually it’s game shows, Fox News, and booming base” (sounds like you’re in the hallway right outside a movie theater). So he points to his sound-bar and says it could be that, and I was like yes, it’s definitely that. He again tries to blame commercials and I again point out that I can identify the shows he’s watching from the other side of my apartment. He kinda shrugs and that’s all for that interaction, not much came of it. He’s kind of a belligerent person but not outright rude or crazy....or so I thought. 

Another month or so goes by and I’m home alone doing school and hear all of the sudden “n*****!” shouted super loud like 30 times over (my husband and I, and this neighbor are all white). By like the 10th time I’m honestly not sure where it’s coming from, thinking it could be from above me or outside, after like the 20th I’m concerned it’s a real altercation, someone is in danger and I need to call the police, but I wanted to identify where it was coming from first. So I stick my head out the door, don’t really hear anything, and then fully step out to see if it’s outside but distant. Well....this dude steps out into the breezeway too. Crap. He looks at me and questions why I’m out there and then thinking he came out to check the situation out too I said “Did you hear yelling too? Do you know what’s going on?” And he said “What!?” Very angrily. So I said, “Were you....yelling? Is everything okay?” And he. went. off. “Mind your business you stupid bitch.” I literally threw my hands up and said “Woah, I was just wondering...” and he cut me off, “Yeah you do a lot of that. Watch some tv you dumb bitch. Stupid motherf*cker.” At this point I’m overwhelmed and immediately go back in my apartment. I never planned on confronting anyone regardless of who it was, I was just concerned someone was not okay. But he stood in the breezeway for another good 3-5 minutes shouting insults at my door calling me all the things he already had to my face. I do really poorly with confrontation so I was shaking, I called my husband at work, and just decided that I wouldn’t call the police unless something further happened. This all seemed really out of character for what we had experienced before and pretty unstable and unwarranted to yell at a pregnant woman, but he didn’t specifically threaten me or anything so I didn’t want to bother the police with it. Later that night he turned the sound-bar on, turned it up super loud so that I could hear every word of Family Feud as if it was playing through my own tv and later played one of Trump’s speeches at almost the same volume while chanting “Donald Trump!” over and over. 

The whole thing had me really nervous. This was not honestly too long ago, I think early March. I went down to our management office the next day and basically just put them on notice about the whole situation. Everything up to that point. They called him and told him multiple people had complained about his noise level (true, I found out) and he needed to keep it down. He was belligerent, but I noticed a drop again in noise for a couple weeks. I asked if any of this would affect the renewal of his lease and they said not just this, but it if it was an ongoing situation, he had lots of complaints against him, and people felt unsafe it could. This was all from a new property manager, the previous one was terrible and was the reason I had never involved the office before. I avoid him at all costs now, I won’t speak to him and I avoid going outside when I know he’s out there, it’s just not a situation I can deal with since he escalated it.

However, one Saturday in April in the middle of the day he started playing a Trump speech very loud with his door open again for over an hour, and this time my husband was fed up. We could hear it over the show we were watching. So he went over there and said, “Turn it down or close your door”. Neighbor starts yelling at him that he needs to get away from his apartment and my husband just repeats it (he was heated for sure, but never went into neighbors apartment and never said anything else). So neighbor calls him all kinds of names too, tells him we need to move, and makes a move off his couch AT my husband. My husband just turned around and came back to our apartment, he really wanted to get into it with this guy but thankfully has a good head on his shoulders and was thinking about me and baby. So this time he called the police, I wasn’t over there, but he felt like the move wasn’t just getting up to have a conversation or the shut the door, it was threatening in nature. The deputy showed up about 20 minutes later, talked to us, and took a report, but like everything else up to this point nothing has technically happened so 1. He didn’t necessarily want to go talk to him and inflame the situation, and 2. He didn’t really do anything in the eyes of the law. My husband and I just feel like he could be slightly volatile though, with how he escalated from interactions 1 &amp; 2 to 3 &amp; 4 we’re not sure what the future could hold and want what’s happening now documented. As an aside,  he came and knocked on our door like 10 minutes after the deputy left but we didn’t answer because he’s not very predictable. 

The apartment manager told me to keep her updated, so we sent an update with this newest development, but didn’t receive a response, which was okay, we didn’t really need one. But we found out a few days later our apartment complex has been sold and is under new management. So now, part of my predicament is not knowing whether they know about this whole situation at all. I don’t want it to be 0-100 for them when we and the people around us have been having issues for months, but again nothing has really happened tangibly. 

However, tonight again he started yelling “f***ing n*****” repeatedly. Again, we’re both white, but this is really setting me off. On top of just being a generally obnoxiously loud chainsmoking, coughing/hacking, gross old man, with a loud tv and dog, he’s obviously a terrible racist. I have zero tolerance for that in my life, and yet I’m hearing it in my living space. Part of me wants to say it’s his apartment and it’s not my business, but it is 1000% affecting me. I am very close to having my baby now and 1. I can feel my blood pressure rise every time I hear him say that and stress is not good for baby, and 2. My baby might not be able to understand right away, but I honestly just don’t want them hearing it often either (this could be hormones, that and the fact that maybe my ears are sensitive for the same reason, are where I think pregnancy may come in). 

I don’t know if the tv noise will make it hard for baby to sleep during the day either, I am a light sleeper, but my husband is not so it remains to be seen. I am not under any impression that apartment living is 100% silent, I hear the people above us making normal living noises all the time, but this literal constant tv noise that I’m not choosing is driving me insane. 

At this point, I think in my head the best course of action is to go the new management and ask them 1. If they know about/still have record of everything, and 2. If his yelling racial slurs audibly through my wall affects anything legally on their end, like is it more of an offense than a loud tv? All of this is so borderline and seems inane, but I don’t know what to do about it. We can’t move, it’s just not an option right now, I can’t always have noise going to drown him out because of school and soon baby sleeping. I’m honestly concerned he’ll re-sign his lease if I don’t say anything, but I don’t know if I can do anything anyways. I’ll take whatever course of action they say to, but I’m honestly feeling at a breaking point where I want to complain to them every day I hear him yelling slurs and can hear his tv to where I can tell what he’s watching, or I’m going to start calling the police. Again, I don’t care what this guy does on his own time and in his own space, but this is affecting me so. much. 

I know this is so long, but I needed to get this out there even a little bit to rant. Does legal advice apply? Or do I just need a gut check? Am I being petty? Do I need to post this somewhere else? He annoys me, and he’s insanely disrespectful to women, POCs, and people in general, so to a degree I’m going to be petty. But I’m also over putting up with his BS so he can be comfortable and I have to suffer through. Please be honest and help me gain perspective on this mess."

"[OH] Buying my first house but not comfortable with my name and address being listed on the auditor's website. I want to create and put it in a Trust. I am in the process of buying my first house and I am very uncomfortable with having my name and address listed on the County Auditor's website. The reasons are very personal, but long story short I have a stalker. 


I talked to the auditor's office, and they told me my only option would be to put the house inside of a trust or an LLC. My lender told me a trust was my only option. I am already a few weeks out from closing but is this possible? 


I plan on naming the trust something non identifying and using a sibling as the trustee, because they don't have the same last name as I do. My sibling is concerned about what their duties would be and any legal or financial ramifications they would face. Credit score, IRS, etc.


What is this process like? What can the trustee expect? Do I file a tax return for the trust every year even though there is no income?


Tldr; in order to keep my address private on my County Auditor's website, I want to create a trust to put the house I'm about to buy into."
"Case worker not responding I’ve had full custody of two young girls recently in foster care. I have no real case “manager” but their other siblings do, and sometimes I end up speaking with her (we’ll call her “A”) for visits and things like that. The girls we’re housing have a history of being abused by their father and step father sexually. They’ve been trafficked for money, known to their mother. They were raised with some very bad life views, and have gone as far as imitating intercourse with one another in the past. We’ve gotten a handle on this, reported it to the case worker we USED to have, and therapy has been going on for the year we’ve had them. With quarantine, therapy hasn’t been happening. This, the abuse between these small girls has been happening again. Ive done everything I possibly can to ensure this no longer happens. They don’t change together, bathe together, have any privacy playing together (play in the family room, or leave the bedroom door open), I stay up until 4 am most nights just to make sure they’re really asleep and won’t sneak to each other’s beds. We only have 2 bedrooms in our house and cannot separate them by room. I’ve tried reporting it to social services several times and no one ever returns my calls or answers me back. I’ve sent emails as well. I’m wondering, the next time an incident might happen, who can I call? Is calling the police on a 6 and 9 year old too extreme? I do not want my home to become and unsafe place for either of them. NOTE: Our social services is through a small Native American tribe as my husband is Native American. We do not go through the state of Mississippi’s CPS.

"[DC] Do I have a right to know if there have been any Covid-19 cases in my apartment complex? Recently, a local newspaper published that there had been an alleged death in my apartment complex due to Covid 19. I called my management company and asked what they could tell me and they said they can't confirm or deny anything because it violates HIPAA.   


Comparatively, a few weeks ago, my friend's management company sent a letter saying there was a case of covid-19 in their building and they were providing information to local contact tracing team to figure out if this person might have come into contact with other tenants in common spaces, such as the laundry room.

I'm looking for guidance. Do I have a legal right to know if there has been a case of Covid-19 in my building?"
"Friend got T boned by car that sped up and blew a red light Idk if I got flair right. Feel free to correct me.

My friend was T boned at a crossing in Maine USA. He did not have a stop sign and the other guy did. There is video footage of the other guy and a women speeding up blowing the stop sign and hitting my friend. My friend ended up with a mild concussion. He isn't the best prepared legaly since he is under 18 but with the tape with the police he will probably not at fault. 

It seemed like the other couple did it for insurance reasons and will be in charge of paying for all damages. My worry is that my friends insurance is going to go up and that they could have killed him. Can they be charged and what is the best action for my friend to do.

"My father died of COVID in a nursing home last week and I'm unable to obtain any information on his death because I'm not listed as a health proxy/party of contact. NYC What I'm seeking:

&amp;#x200B;

Legal advice to consider legal actions because I can't compete with this level of possessiveness. I also suspect negligence on the nursing home's behalf as their avoidant behavior of not answering phones in the midst of a pandemic is questionable. I would also like to know about the validity of health proxies after death and how it may impact this situation. I cannot accept being left in dark as a blood relative, not knowing where his body is.

&amp;#x200B;

What happened:

&amp;#x200B;

My father passed of COVID complications on April 29th in a Manhattan nursing home. My mom and I have been in contact with the nursing home but they refuse to provide any info on his death or funeral arrangements. In the weeks leading up to his death we phoned many times, calls were rarely answered. When my mom got through, she was told someone would get back to her but of course they didn't. When she did reach someone, they had told her he had contracted the virus, but he was okay and on oxygen (it wasn't clear whether that meant ventilator or not). Later on she was told he was on antibiotics. Eventually, we were discreetly notified of his death 5 days after his passing through a health aide personally known by my mother. His health proxy/party of contact is a woman who is abrasive, possessive, avoidant, and withholds all his information.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 29 years old and I'm his only child, he and my mother were never married though they separated when I was a toddler (due to financial issues on his part, and my mom obtaining a job opportunity overseas &amp; his unwillingness to join her). I maintained contact with him, spent summers with him and I also lived with him for two years as a teen. His health proxy is a woman whom he dated before AND after being with my mom - that timeline is problematic news to me. This woman named 'S', has a lot of animosity towards my mom. Apparently my father left her for my mom back in the 80s, she would call my mother demanding to speak to my father. 'S' is the one who had him admitted to the nursing home in 2015 after he showed signs of dementia. She didn't bother notifying my mother. My mother instead found out from his neighbor a few weeks later when paying him a visit. My mother and I had disagreed with the idea of placing him in a nursing home, she offered to pay his rent so he can keep his apartment, have some independence, and have some sort of personal health aide. 'S' objected and gave the apartment away. She also yelled at my mom for the idea of letting me live with my dad back when I was a teen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A large part of why I'm not listed as a health proxy is likely because I became somewhat estranged from him in the last 10 years. We had a turbulent history, as he was short-tempered &amp; verbally abusive to me. For this reason, I kept my distance and was never 'ready' to visit him and reconcile although I had intended on doing so since last year. My mother had visited him every few months throughout the years.Whenever my mother encountered 'S' at the nursing home, 'S' would yell and make a scene - 'S' would tell her to stay away from my dad and stop trying to be a part of his life. According to my mother, my father didn't mind my mother's visits. There were also times where my mother inquired about being added as a proxy but was refused because of 'S'. My mother phoned 'S' this week to inquire about my father's death and her response was ""your daughter was not close to her father, leave me alone, there won't be a funeral, it's over! don't call me again!"".

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't spoken to 'S', I am afraid to do so as I'm not mentally/emotionally prepared for her abrasive attitude, yelling, etc. If she is that way towards my mother, she could act the same towards me."
"Charging a non-citizen more to rent My family has been looking for a house because the owners of our current home are selling it. My stepdad is an undocumented immigrant, but this hasn't really been a problem in this rental process until now.

So there's this rental company, let's call them WR, and we were looking at a house they're renting. We took a tour, then were asking a separate person questions to make sure we wanted to put an application in. So my mom brought up my stepdad's non-citizenship, and asked if we could just put his IT number in lieu of a SSN. The woman she was messaging said that the deposit would triple in price if he doesn't have a SSN. 

Is this legal? I'm in Utah if that helps. We don't wanna rent from them because of this, but that kinda put a sour taste in my mouth."
"Got a lease with 3 other roommates in Berkeley, but two wants to leave and two wants to stay? Two people wants to stay but two others want to cancel. Hi im going to living living with 3 other roommates starting summer; however, 2 of them is trying to cancel the lease while me and someone else are looking to stay. We just got an email saying that if we want to cancel the lease, our only way is to find people and transfer the lease to them. Unfortunately, they said if we cant find someone, they will help us find it but we have to pay an extra half a month worth of rent per month!

At this point, I pretty much decided its better to just cancel the lease together, but how can we get out security deposit back and not get our credit deducted? Also they stated ""if we dont pay rent, the home owners will take your group to collections, which will affect the whole group"".  Is this even allowed since a global pandemic is happening right now. But it almost impossible to look for people to transfer the lease too.

Since we all signed the lease together, its most likely we have to stay in the same page. What happens if some of us decides to stay pay rent and others don't?

"[California] Thinking about suing employer for potential wrongful termination, what documents should I gather? I work in a small biomedical lab as a non-exempt employee. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, my department went through a mass layoff and the management currently has no intention of hiring new people. 

Recently, my supervisor (M) started to giving me more and more tasks that are mainly HIS job responsibilities, which caused me frequently working overtime without getting paid. I asked for his approval for the overtime, but he refused to do so and blamed me for being unproductive (which is absolutely not true). I want to talk to HR, but the HR in this company is a joke and I honestly don’t think reporting to HR would help at all. 

I‘m considering to stop whatever I am working on immediately when my shift ends if my overtime isn’t approved. The task I’m mainly responsible for has to be completed daily due to its nature. Not be able to completing it in time would guarantee me a termination, so I would like to be advised what kind of lawsuit preparation I need to do at this point. I would also be very appreciated if you have any suggestions for remedying the situation. 

Thank each one of you in advance. Please stay healthy and take good care of yourself. We’ll get through this tough time all together 💪🏼

tl;dr: I will get terminated for refusing to work unpaid overtime. What documents should I gather now if I want to file a wrongful termination lawsuit later?"
"Employer is JUST NOW changing my pay bc of COVID; HELP? Sorry in advance but i I am writing this on mobile. I am looking for some help on what my options are. 

I work in TX as an outside salesman selling standby generators for residential homes. I started this position in February with an agreement that I would be compensated $500 a week in base pay plus commissions on whatever i sold.

Now I do want to mention that we were the first group to receive a weekly base pay and the more senior guys work solely off of commissions. Also our benefits did not kick in until 60 days have passed from our start date. My start date was Feb 10 and during the months of March and April we were sent out to homes to conduct appointments during the height of the pandemic. I brought the attention to my superiors that we were not insured at the time and asked if the company was willing to help in any way if were to get sick? We(coworkers included) were asking to just have the 60 days waived so we could sign up to be covered in case you know one of us got sick during a pandemic. Short answer is they said no.

Yesterday my boss comes to me and the three other guys who started at the same time as me and wants to meet with us individually. In the meeting he tells us we are no longer going to get our base pay. He wanted us to sign a new compensation plan right there but none of us did and he said it needed to be signed and returned by this coming Tuesday. Now i questioned him as to why this is happening since we previously had an agreement in place and his.answer was bc of covid. I would like to mention that we were an essential business during the pandemic and never closed down once. It also happens that we had sold more units in March and April than the previous year for those same months so I dont understand how he could put the blame on the pandemic when our numbers were better than lst year non-pademic? I then asked him what would happen if we did not sign? He response was we would part as friends.... I asked him what he meant by that  because it sounded like he was going to fire us if we didnt sign? He continued to use the same line until he finally said if i didnt sign they would fire me.
 We are fighting for the base pay because our job has us  driving our cars too two or three appointments a day with many being on average 30 miles away one way. We do not get anything for gas or to maintain our vehicles. 

 So here i am today looking for help with what I could do as his reasoning in my eyes holds no grounds(i.e. We are an Essential business never closed, better numbers than last year) and it sounds like he is try to use coercion via the pandemic to go back on our previously agreed upon compensation andhave us sign a new one. All of us that started at the same time are sticking together on this and would like to know our options. I dont know if this will change anything but all four of us are Hispanic as well."
"I was given eroneous information regarding my financial aid by my schools financial aid department that resulted in me dropping two courses I should not have. In a nutshell, my school didn't handle the transition to online courses for the Covid outbreak well at all. 

I was advised to contact financial aid about dropping courses to make sure it wouldn't affect me financially. 

Here is the email I sent. 

""To whom it may concern,

I am writing to confirm something I was just told by a nice lady in the financial aid department. If I drop courses by the end of the day, April 2nd 2020, I will not be charged for those courses. I just wanted to make sure this is the case, and if so I will be dropping both the history class and the political science class.""

Here is the response I was sent: 

""This is correct. If you withdraw today or any time after today, you will be past 60% attendance for the spring semester and **will not have any billing to your financial aid.**""

I enrolled for some summer classes but was told I was maxed on my financial aid for the year. ""That's weird."" I thought. I reached out again to the head of the financial aid department and I was told that I am not receiving a refund for the two courses I dropped, and I am still responsible to repay those loans. 

By all accounts I am absolutely still on the hook for those classes. 

What are my options here? 

I've also got a problem where one of my teachers literally stopped teaching the class for the remainder of the semester, and I'm considering taking legal action against them for this as well. I didn't get what I paid for, and I feel like I was lied to. The head of the financial aid department has already told me they would have answered my question the same way and I'm just so frustrated they think me not getting a refund and having to repay the loans is somehow *not* being billed for them.

This is in Tennessee, btw."
"Vet chipped our cat's tooth (NYC) Hi, like many, I never thought I would post here, and I'm not even sure if there is any legal route to take, though I'm concerned the vet has been negligent. My cat had trouble urinating (a common issue), and so we took him to the vet. He had to stay two nights (Wednesday - Friday), and have a catheter in. The first night, he removed his catheter overnight. He did the same the second night, we're not sure if they had a cone in him or implemented any additional precautions after he removed it the first night. Apparently he removed his e-collar before removing his own catheter.

Due to the pandemic, we are not able to physically enter the building, so we are unable to visit him.

We were told yesterday we would be able to pick him up today and that he had improved. After calling 3 times over two days to see what time we should pick him up, each time reception assured we would get a call back, they finally called us. Apparently, he has been quite aggressive (he's obviously in pain and terrified), and they've been keeping him in the cage as much as possible, but 10 minutes before they called, he (in their words) ""lunged at one of the technicians"" in an attempt to get off the table. The technician apparently caught him mid-air, and in the confusion his front canine was cracked to the point of needing removal.  They don't know where he hit his head, they don't know how the tooth was cracked, but they have offered to remove the tooth without charge. 

We have also just been told he needs to stay over the weekend for bladder surgery to remove bladder stones, which will occur today, and that the tooth will be removed directly after the surgery. They allegedly discovered ""pea sized"" stones that could not be passed via the catheter, and that it was discovered by an ultrasound after an x-ray (which they take when they insert the catheter to ensure it's well placed). I don't understand how this was missed over the past two x-rays and how we are only just now being informed that he needs surgery.

My concern is that, they said he had been ""feisty"" and ""aggressive"" the entire stay, so is it neglectful that they had him in a situation where he could escape and chip his tooth? We're upset he will need to have his tooth removed, we're upset we had to call several times before the vet called us back to update us, and we're upset that we were clearly told yesterday afternoon we would be able to pick him up today and that now he has to stay until the end of the weekend, costing us twice as much as the original quote. We feel we haven't been kept in the loop and are wondering if l, legally, there is any case for neglect here?"
BCNR adjudication I’ve been at the BCNR (board of corrections naval records) for 15 months now. All I’ve heard from the BCNR in regards to my pending case is that they went through a final legal review 3 weeks ago on April 16. They said that now it’s being adjudicating. I want to know how much longer will this taken until I get a decision? I got a lot riding on this.
"Potential Child Abuse Issues, Unsure What to Do. Alt account because subject matter.

So this may be California and it may be Oregon.

To simplify matters my brother in law was just arrested for child porn. Multiple counts stretching 2 years (based on arraignment records). Everything I have is second hand so I know nothing directly but from what I can tell he was sending and or recieving images (unsure if video is involved). He is in Oregon and we are in California.

My wife on at least two occasions has brought our two kids up to see her sister and there have been times that our kids were alone with him. I want to know if they were involved but I dont know who to ask or how to go about it. My sister in law won't talk about it and seems to be thinking that the system is railroading the guy.

Bail has been set high and they can't afford it so he is in at least until pretrial in a few months.

I haven't talked to my kids about it because I don't want to plant the issue in their heads. My wife and I are in agreement that we should do something but we don't know what. I have no specific reason to believe anything bad happened, but I also didnt think he traded in CP prior to this past week. So do I call police in Oregon? Do I call RAAIN (sp)?"
"Knock wants repair money from more than 1 year ago I bought a house using Knock. We moved in before closing, signed an agreement regarding this time frame. While we were living there but before we owned the home, we discovered a plumbing problem requiring repairs at about $1500.00  The damage had been done outside the house by a utility company (plumber says the line was crushed by heavy equipment, a utility company had driven heavy equipment or done some digging prior to us moving in). Knock arranged for these repairs. Our inspection had not discovered the problem.

It has been about 13 months now. Knock is contacting us saying we must cover the cost of these repairs. We did sign an agreement saying we would cover damage during this awkward time of living in a house we didn't own yet. But they made the arrangements and didn't bill us for 13 months? Is that ok? The agreement we signed also said that Knock would have insurance on the property during this time frame. How should we proceed? I will include the relevant text from this agreement below:

""Buyer shall make no alterations, repairs or improvements to Property without first obtaining the prior written consent

of Seller. If Seller so consents, Buyer shall promptly pay all third parties for labor, services and materials performed

or supplied in making said alterations, repairs or improvements. Buyer shall furnish Seller with proof that all said

labor, services and materials have been paid for and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against, and from, any

and all liens which may be asserted or filed against the Property relating to the making of said alterations, repairs or

improvements.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement or the Offer to Purchase and Contract to the contrary, in the

event that the sale is not consummated for any reason, any alterations, repairs or improvements made pursuant to this

paragraph shall be the sole property of Seller, and Buyer: (a) shall not be entitled to be reimbursed or compensated for

making or having made any of said alterations, repairs or improvements; and (b) waives any right to assert or file any

lien against Property.""

""Seller shall, at Seller’s expense, retain fire and extended insurance coverage on Property until the date of closing.

Buyer acknowledges that such insurance coverage does not cover Buyer’s personal possessions and that Buyer shall

bear the risk of loss on Buyer’s personal property or for injuries sustained should Property be destroyed by fire or any

act of nature during the time that the Buyer is in possession.""

"Legal/Financial Quandry? Hi All!  Throwaway account, thanks for reading, apologies for formatting.

I've been renting an apartment for 3 years now and my landlord, who works in a very COVID impacted sector has decided to sell the building so I need to find new housing asap.

Apparently a relative with my same name has opened a few credit cards using my identity.  I will not file a police report as this relative is the primary caretaker for a disabled family member.  (They would be sent to a government run nursing home during the pandemic)

When I found this out my initial thought was to pay the debts but as things progressed I thought my money would be best used as savings than fixing the issue.

In hindsight - last year i had a weird knock at the back of my door.  When I asked who was there someone said they had paperwork for me and put papers that looked like junk mail at the back window.  I panicked and told them no one with name lived here.

Were those legal papers?  Would i be in trouble for ignoring them?  

I was prepared to discuss the credit issue with any potential landlords (I have savings, years of employment and references from current landloard) but with this new thinking, would I pass a background check?  Am I in trouble financially and legally?"

"[IA] My cat was physically abused by her previous owner. This morning, we learned from our vet that she has serious trauma-related internal damage. Is it worth consulting a lawyer to see if we have any avenues toward recovering veterinary costs from the previous owner? It's very possible (if not likely) that my cat will not make it through this, and I am gutted at the thought of losing her.

I'm aware of the challenges that lie in proving the abuse and that the abuse caused the damage, but, assuming these things can be demonstrated, is there any chance of having a case here? To be frank, I doubt I have a case, because my understanding is that the law always treats pets as property, but I'm hoping that there may be some nuance to that. Is it worth consulting a lawyer, or can I safely assume that there is nothing here?

If it's relevant, the vet costs will likely be between 3k and 7k. I've found levity in this classic cat-related quote: ""I am never going to financially recover from this.""

EDIT: The title is incorrect in that the previous owner was not the abuser. The cat was abused by a housemate before being given to us by the owner."

"City making us pay them $375 for an inspection Hello, we are a homeowner in the city of Rosemead California. Our city is telling us to file for an inspection for an issue that was assumed to be resolved in 2016. We had modified our garage to have an extra bathroom but we didn't know that it was illegal at the time. The city gave us a warning and told us to tear it down, so we did, and they said that they will inspect it within 2 weeks or so. However, they never came to inspect it. Just recently, they sent us an letter saying that we must file for an inspection online. I thought it was absolutely ridiculous so I emailed one of their building technicians about this issue. They said that we have to apply for a $375 permit, which to my knowledge is a building permit that is used to apply for modifications. I said that it was ridiculous and they emailed back saying that I should send my contact info, so I did, they never called. Then, just yesterday, they stuck a paper on our front door saying that there will be a $700 fine if we do not apply for an inspection or something along that line. We are already struggling with money, is the city allowed to do this? making us apply for a building permit for something that we tore down?"
"My elderly aunt needs to evict her worthless siblings. Help! I'm not sure how to start this as I've never posted to r/legal advice before, but here goes! 
 My elderly aunt lives in/owns a house (she has paid it off)that her two also aging siblings live with her. They have  no contracts or renters agreements and to my knowledge do not pay rent or contribute much beyond buying groceries and some light housework (barely). My aunt has rapidly advancing Parkinson's and is mostly housebound due to the pandemic and that she has trouble walking even with a walker. One sibling, sibling A, has lived there for over a decade and he is kind of a mess, perhaps an alcoholic or has some anger management issues. He has a job. The other sibling, sibling B,  moved up here a couple  years ago and never found employment, she is very stubborn. 

Sibling B helps out a bit with my aunt's home care needs but isn't very nice to her and often thinks that my aunt should just be able to do it herself. Sibling A only does things when asked and only if he is in a ""good"" mood. 

My elderly mother goes over to this house daily to help my aunt shower and get dressed and make sure her needs are met.
 
Sibling B refuses to wear a mask and doesn't believe.in the coronavirus. I don't know if she practices social distancing or hand washing even when she goes out. She is putting the health of my aunt and my mom at great risk. No amount of begging, asking will change her mind. 

Sibling A got angry at my mother last week when she asked him to help with something. He physically pushed her! She was scared.

Basically my mother can no longer go over there and help my aunt out with these new developments. My aunt doesn't really want these siblings to live there anymore but she is scared and sad and not sure what to do. She doesn't have a lot of money beyond social security.

How can my aunt legally get these two out of her house in the least painful way possible? What if she needs to sell her house and move into a assisted living home? What can I do to help protect her interests? My mom has signed some papers recently that put her in charge of some of my aunt's will I believe also, but I'm not sure what exactly. 

 This might not even be the right subreddit, I'm just so frustrated and feel helpless and directionless. These siblings would probably be homeless without my aunt's house, which no one wants but they are both so terrible to live with. Edit: location Washington State."
"HELP! A guy registered to our address without our knowledge For some time now we have been receiving mail from court to out address, addressed to a person we don't know. The recent events have shown that the guy is my sister's boyfriend and me and my mom have a stong suspicion that they set our address as his permanent or temporary address as well. I would like to give my sister the benefit of the doubt and say that he did it himself, but I'm pretty sure that someone form the address had to be present. 

My mom owns 4/6 of the house, while me and my sister own 1/6 each. Could she have done that without my mothers approval?

They only know each other for 2 months and we really don't think this is appropriate, especially now when we are planing to sell the house and move.

What can be done and how to tackle this situation. Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance for any replys."
"Neighbor neglecting dog with wound One of my neighbors has mutiple dogs, several of which roam outside. I’m very fond of one that likes to hang out around my house, and I recently found a deep and wide laceration (so deep I can see muscle) on her. She can walk with a limp, and visibly seems like it is bothering her. I took her to the owner’s house, told them, and they said they would take her to the vet the next day. It has now been a few days, she’s come back to my house, with the laceration still there. I would take her to the vet myself, but I can not afford it.

"Do I need to keep paying rent? (Ohio) Several months ago I moved out of an apartment with 2 roommates after deciding that they I could not live with them any longer. This happened mid lease and to get myself off of the original lease with the landlord I drafted an alternate agreement with my roommates. The agreement was strictly between the roommates and myself. It stated that I would pay rent until the end of the lease with no other real specifications. No amount of rent to be paid was not specified either. It was then signed by all three of us. Last month they moved a friend into my old room and she now lives in the apartment. They deny that their friend lives there, but she has long since moved in a bed and other personal belongings. I no longer want to pay them rent if they have someone else living in my old space. Is this contract legally binding? Does the fact that no specific rent payment amount was specified make any difference?
Edit: I was removed from the original lease by the landlord."
"Paypal suspension because of possible copyright infringement of intelectual properties, plaintiff's lawyer asking for $1,500 settlement Hello y'all,

In November 2019 I received an email that stated my PayPal account has been suspended because PayPal received a court order to limit my access to it due to a possible infringement of intellectual properties of Grumpy Cat Limited.

Division  
Plaintiff: Grumpy Cat Limited  
Court Case Number: Grumpy Cat Limited v The Individuals Corporations LLC et

I check on the court case, it doesn't have my name in it. Why it doesn't have my name on the defendants' list?  
I'm selling tote bags on eBay. I bought it from a dropshipping supplier in China and they will send the product to the final buyer for me. I don't create the design, I'm just reselling it. I didn't know that my supplier didn't pay for the copyright.

I contacted Grumpy Cat's lawyer (Hughes, Socol, Piers, Resnick &amp; Dym, Ltd) they're asking for $1,500 settlement. I googled this lawyer's office name, apparently, they are known for ""copyrights troll""?  They are suing thousands of people for Grumpy Cat. What should I do?

Is it possible to make them cancel this case?  Do I need to hire a lawyer for this?  
Thank you in advance."

"Family litigation on abandonment and abuse TL;DR: I'm writing regarding a Family Law litigation issue in Brazil, It's a complex case involving long term mistreatment, Affective/Material Abandonment, and constant abuse of a mentally disabled youth. Looking for serious advice on how to get off this situation and where to seek real help.

Although we are going through a period of contingency and quarantine due to this unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. But once the routine normalizes on a larger scale, it would ask for legal assistance with a deal that should have been in progress since at least 2008. I'll ask that due legal process be done in view of an injunction of this urgent request.

I'm intending to plead, due to affective and material persistent abandonment and if possible: in order to investigate his incomes, the breach of secrecy of his tax revenue of the last 4 years and respective payslips, including from his businesses. Due to misdemeanors motivated by religious fundamentalist sect engagement. Judicial decision for the father to undergo psychiatric expertise and possible therapeutic referral to the conditions: TOD - Opposing Challenge Disorder (CID F91.3) and dissocial personality disorder (CID F60. 2). if possible: change of family for late adoption to another with the same socioeconomic conditions in order to maintain studies in higher education and maintain specialized medical treatment for my mental condition and other physical conditions until I acquire experience to work. and if accepted: later suspension of family power of origin so that instead of compensation for moral and psychological damage, I am in fact placed in a family so that I have support in addition to financial and emotional stable in the long term. There is a very strong aspect involving psychological violence and emotional abuse that prevails in my case. If it is to be classified as an infraction, misdemeanor or crime, as it will be dealt with by the courts, its various implications to be reflected in the sentence, I would prefer that pecuniary and socio educational measures be taken in the foreground.

I am 27 years old, I do specialized health treatment, including psychiatric. I'm diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder depressive type (CID F25. 1) and ADHD. I'm on treatment for at least 10 years. I have lived in countryside in Brazil for two years. My father, who provides for me, is a cardiologist physician. But we still have constant friction for a long time monetary reason.

Here is my account of some of the facts that persisted during the mistreatment suffered in living with my family of origin:

During early childhood until mid adolescence I suffered physical punishment and isolation for hours on end. I suffered malnutrition, depression and child stress since before the age of 6 due to the absence of my father, and even with his relative presence of a few minutes a day at a later time, I had social and material deprivation from him and from my biological mother. During the time I lived with my progenitor, I was the object of constant psychological games and terror besides her and his moral harassment. Together, my immediate family kept my friends and other people away from me with rumors and defamation of these friends and their parents. My parent not only denied the period in which I was punctually sexually molested and constantly emotionally abused by my biological mother, but also inflicted on me discrimination and isolation because of the first signs of my affective orientation being homosexual, as well as intimidation and overcharging for independence without the necessary financial and emotional support in the pre-adolescent period.

I was abandoned in a fundamentalist evangelical school on a reformatory like regiment with sporadic monthly visits from family, already at the age of 11 when I suffered enticement and collective rape in the dormitory by 3 other adolescent boys for at least 1 year. Leaving there, I was forced to move from a city with no health care structure and not say goodbye to colleagues and friends for at least 6 consecutive times. I suffered harassment and bullying in some schools and missed the last year of high school by a nervous breakdown. I was abandoned in long-term psychiatric clinics with divergent treatments to my health condition and spent years without clinical improvement. My various health problems were neglected over the years until I recently sought health insurance on my own initiative. I am still the object of constant humiliation and subjugation on the pretext of having tried marijuana even though I no longer have contact or use during those years (since at least 2013). Even though I have been taking treatments and trying to cure my difficulties, he denies my situation and according to him my attitude is bad will and lack of shame.

I suffered insidious discrimination through punitive treatment because I was born a man. Mainly as a man who does not act according to the ideal of dominant male gender role tied to the idea that there is usually a natural role and social forms of behavior for men due to the social stigma in relation to my lack of masculine aggressiveness, disparaging my notion of masculinity.

Domestic violence with regard to controlling, coercive and threatening behavior. The mistreatment of those entrusted to my care and guidance. Any behavior interpreted as inappropriate for any family member and which could lead them to believe that such behavior was considered unacceptable, was seen as a direct challenge to their intended authority. This repetitive and humiliating treatment, which threatens, intimidates, frightens, continually criticizes, devalues efforts in private or even public, and exercises emotional manipulation.

Emotional abuse involving nullifying or demoralizing the feeling of self-esteem and autonomy. Psychological violence based on my gender, resulting in serious harm and suffering through threats, coercion, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, negatively impacting my identity, well-being and dignity. Including violence abuse through verbal and non-verbal language, bullying, stalking, homophobia.

Under a facade that imputes incomprehension as socially accepted violence in this country, through which the prevailing view of the social sphere is legitimized. Being hidden in every action and denied in practice by the observable form of the act. I do not know if it was consciously done in an architectural or rational way. It was a kind of symbolic violence that worked through complicity between the practitioners of the immediate family and their peers, either in their willingness to dominate or a certain willingness to submit on my part.

This covert form of violence was a way of exercising dominance and exploitation over my psychological. Consisting of a dynamic in nuance, easier to apply because it is less susceptible to reproach. Just as the accumulation of power over the other is legitimated by active denial and concealment in subtle signs recognized as legitimate requests for change to behavior that would be accepted by these aggressors.

The financial abuse that occurred was about controlling my access to the family's economic resources in addition to social deprivation in order to reduce or prevent the culturally normal interaction between an individual and the rest of secular society. Consequently, it diminished my ability to support myself, increasing my dependence on the aggressor. My aggressor has made me financially dependent for an indefinite period of time, including reduced access to better education, employment, career advancement, and the acquisition of assets. Even forcing or pressing me to sign documents to open accounts and use checks for his own use and benefit.

My livelihood was placed in a closely monitored grant, avoiding any expense without the consent of the aggressor, leading to **minute accumulation of debt and depletion of any savings. Disagreements over money spent could result in retaliation for additional physical or emotional abuse.**

He is financially able to provide for my needs such as clothing and furniture, but constantly defers expenses other than college tuition, housing, food and medicine. Today I live by myself, have decent housing, minimal food, and medical treatment provided by my constant insistence on sacrificing clothing and furniture. He makes use of psychological games and constant emotional blackmail to diminish these insistence. Today even my first order needs are treated with contempt and constant postponement until their nullity or status-quo. My expenses are taxed as 'stewardship' or 'expense' and he justifies by saying that since he has never had access to such support, even showing conditions to provide, he alters himself and threatens me by saying that this is none of my business and acts with avoidance and rejection of any change to the situation that might favor me. He also avoids issues related to any change in the budget, says that I need to save money (which is not being enough for all the treatments and food needed). I proposed several times to live on a major city here in Brazil so that I could take a shorter professional course and start working but he insists that he would not support me if he left where I am. He makes threats, pressure and blackmail so I won't seek help or leave what he dictates. While any opportunity for financial and social autonomy ever offered was constantly sabotaged at that time.

Due to problems with work justice, my father coerced me into opening bank accounts and signing sales documents for another of his cars. He still uses bank accounts in my name and doesn't give me access to the money in them. Lately my father hangs up his cell phone and does not answer my calls during the week. When I finally **get in touch, he doesn't talk to me for more than 10 minutes on the phone.** When he visits me, sometimes once a month in the city where I live, and when I mention any kind of reconciliation or long-term involvement in trying to appease this conflict, he implies that he now has another family and that I will probably have no inheritance. Concerned about keeping up appearances, my parents preferred to lead a way of life that collaterally impaired my psychological and professional structuring rather than ask for an abortion or even adoption at an appropriate age.

Thanks for reading, love and warmth for all of you."
"Divorcing Spouse going after in-laws assets??? My (37F) soon to be ex-husband (38M) is not making this divorce as amicable as we originally had intended.

The basic state of things is that we've been married for 15 years and have a 12 year old daughter. We live in the state of Texas, currently own a home, and one vehicle. The home is still under mortgage while the vehicle is paid off.

I am legally disabled and receive SSDI monthly, while he is partially disabled and received VA benefits monthly while also being able to be employed. He is currently not working, as he was laid off in January.  We have one joint bank account as well as a savings account with his name on it and he has a secondary checking account that was his prior to our marriage that his VA benefits are deposited into. (I just realized that literally my name is only on one of these accounts and it is making me ill to my stomach.)

There are a multitude of reasons for this divorce - bad communication, emotional manipulation, general irreconcilable differences - but when I stated to him that this was the route I was going to take, he agreed to not fight me on it. My daughter being 12 stated that she was going to come with me, and begrudgingly agreed to visitation.

He is currently living with his mother out of state while I pack up the house and get it ready to sell. He states that he will be back at the end of the month, supposedly to pick up his things and put them in storage wherever. Everything was going as swimmingly as possible until we started texting this afternoon regarding discussion of splitting of the assets.

We had agreed previously that we would sell the home and split the profits. I agreed to give him the vehicle as I'll be moving in with my mother and we can share her vehicle. We then started discussing debt that we have and I agreed that we should take the money in the savings account and pay off what debt (credit cards and a loan of approx. 11K that we pulled from his 401K when I had to stop working and my disability had not yet been approved. (We also used my full 401K previously to cover bills and such until my disability was approved.) All seemed fine until we discussed his remaining 401K. I mentioned that in Texas his 401K, as it has all be accrued during the course of our marriage, is considered community property and we could just split it 50/50.

He blew UP.

I was on the phone trying to set an appointment to get his vehicle inspection done, and when I didn't pick up the phone, he resorted to calling my mother. Because I am discussing taking 50% of his 401K, he is threatening to go after any of my mom's accounts (checking, savings, her IRA, etc) that have my name on the account (so that in case of emergencies or death, I will have access) simply because my name is on the account. Is this even *possible?*  His reasoning is that if I'm going after 50% of *his* assets, he's going to go after 50% of mine.

I was really hoping to avoid the lawyer/court route and just go for mediation and get it done as easily and quickly as possible, but it doesn't seem like he's going to be making it easy on me."

I'm curious as to how this all works since the professor said that the ""charges will be submitted to the Office of Academic Integrity Coordinator"" with recommended academic and disciplinary sanctions. Is there legal action that could be taken against me? This was for a class, not to be posted anywhere else. The worst I can do is get expelled right? And if I drop out, there's nothing the University can do about it, right?"
"Noise complaints Hey everyone!,
Currently having a neighbor issue. Every single night, my neighbor turns on loud music at around 10 pm and blares it all night. Sometimes this includes him beating on drums along with the music. I've tried talking to him and called cops 5 times. First 4 times was a simple knock and asking to turn it down. Fifth time, cops didn't even show up. I literally can't get sleep. It's effecting my work and ability to function. This music goes all the way into the morning (5 or 6 am). Its every single night. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

"Drug Testing family members in a divorce Hey guys. need some help. 
My sister is going through a nasty divorce/custody battle with her soon to be Ex-husband in another state. In my sisters case, she will most likely get 100% custody. Because of this, her soon to be ex-husband has been grasping at straws to do whatever it takes to win custody over my niece. So he decided to make up a story and told his lawyer that I’m a coke addict and that my presence would be harmful to his daughter as a reason he should get custody. I don’t do coke. I tried it maybe 10 years ago, but that’s it. This guy doesn’t have any evidence on me because I DONT DO COKE. The only drug I do is occasionally smoke marijuana(non-legal state here). Is it possible that I, someone who doesn’t live in the same state as them, get drug tested for their case? I know it is definitely possible for the parents, but never heard of siblings or family members being tested. I passed a drug test weeks ago but I definitely wouldn’t pass one at the moment. Just to clarify, I’m in a different state, and I do not/will not live with the baby but my niece may visit me(or I visit) every few months. What do you guys think? I don’t want to be the reason my sister loses custody. Am I worried for no reason?"
I am trying to leave a place where I’ve been threatened with physical violence. I’m not on the lease. I was threatened when I decided I would leave. I plan on recording everything while moving and making sure they are aware they are being recorded.  Is there anything I should know before I leave?
"I fear my boss is going to lay me off so his worthless son can stay employed. So I'm in the automotive industry, and I've always been good at my job. Unfortunately with COVID19 going on, there are really big rumors that the departments are going to take a massive staffing cut. My new boss started in September of 2019 and hired his zero experience son a month later. Since January I've been training this kid in my position with my boss saying ""its so you can have days off"". This kid is inexperienced, doesn't care, has aweful hygiene, and is generally just playing games on his phone. However, his dad will pick him over me to stay, I know that now. Another department was shut down and he moved his son from that department over to mine before it happened. The other person in that sector was let go. Anyway, would I have any sort of discrimination case based off of bias for his son if this does happen?


TLDR, I think my boss is going to lay me off in order to keep his son employed even though he is the clear pick to let go because he still lives at home with dad, and I want to know if I'd have any sort of recourse for this? Also, in GA"

"my boyfriend got this letter in the mail. we want to know what exactly it means. link to letter in description. state is florida.

the entire story is is long one, so to keep it short, my boyfriend got his ex pregnant after she lied about not being able to get pregnant. we basically don't know who the father is because she admitted to talking to and doing things with her (now) ex husband (the entire situation is a fucking mess). she also filed for child support for my boyfriend and another guy.

my boyfriend was supposed to get the paternity test done two weeks ago but it got cancelled due to the coronavirus. today, he got this letter in the mail: https://imgur.com/gallery/QlMdmM4

1. we don't know who the father is but the letter referred to my boyfriend as the father.
2. is this a letter basically saying that the baby got taken away from his mother? that's what it sounds like to us ...

the baby's mother also has a second child that got taken away due to terrible living conditions. that child is (i think) 5 now.

we just want more clarification. he tried to call the phone number that was provided around 1130 today, but no one answered. he also asked them to call him back and he hasn't received a call back yet.

if anyone has any questions about the situation, we'll be happy to answer (without giving away too much info)."
"Injured hand at work, not sure of best course of action. This happened in Georgia, United States of 'Murica. Hey all, i need some advice but im not really sure where to go with this. Forgive my grammar and punctuation, injured hand and all. Early this morning while working as a tow truck driver, I injured my hand while loading a landscaping trailer with a flat tire onto my flatbed. I had to remove some railing on the side of my bed in order to safely load it. Some of the railing was diffucult to remove and in the course of lifting up hard, the rail finally popped out. My hand that was gripping the railing came up into the wheel well of the trailer and hit a sharp edge of metal on the trailer. Long story short i got a pretty nasty cut along with 95% of the fingernail being ripped off. It was very painful. I was wearing work gloves when this happened. I immediately got on the radio and reported my injury. While there was a lot of blood, i could tell there wasnt anything a medical professional could or can do for me. 

After reporting the injury to my dispatcher, i was told by management over the phone to either finish my shift or head to the emergency room. Long story short i told management that i didnt think either option was appropriate. I will not be going to a hospital and risk corona infection just to be given some gauss and a sick note so to speak. After telling lower management this, i was told to call someone higher up. I did, and given it about 2 am local, they didnt pick up the phone. No biggie. I will be expecting a call at a more reasonable hour. 

My end goal here is just to get back to work quickly. I dont think i will be able to for a day or maybe a couple, and i have no problem going to an urgent care clinic when they open. I have absolute confidence given how crucial my hands are to my work that the doc will write me a note recommending a little rest. But now im worried i might get fired for not immediately booking it to the ER after being told to go. Even scarier is being let go in a way that would make me ineligible for any type of benefits like unemployment. Im on comission, and with the slowdown im pretty much at minimum wage as is, so it's not the end of the world, but i really just feel like i need a day or two before i can just wrap this hand up and start taking calls again. Am i screwed? Did i shoot myself in the foot? Any input appreciated. Again, totally willing to go to a clinic in the morning to have a doc check me out. Not willing to go to a hospital under any circumstances as the injury is quite painful but not, in my medically untrained eyes, that serious."
"University refuses to recognize my residency Location: Arizona, Public University(funded by tax dollars) 

I'm going into my third year in college and I've been fighting my university about this for 1 year now. I thought I'd bring it up here in case I can take any legal action against them. Here's the story.

The university I attend was an out of state university when I first enrolled as a freshman. Thus, I paid out of state tuition (nonresident). Of course this makes sense, since my parents pay taxes in a different state, etc. 

But my whole family decided to move with me when I moved for college. They were already planning it, so they settled down in the state of my college around when I started my first year there. They got a job there, bought a house, basically switched everything over to the new state. We figured that the change would be cool to try and hey, after 1 year, I can file for instate tuition since I count as a resident.

This is where things get fishy. After a whole year and my parents filed their taxes in the new state, I decided to file a residency petition at my university. We provided all our drivers licenses, tax forms, etc. We thought that this would be an easy process: get a approved and done, instate tuition!

But I got denied. They said that since my parents moved during the same time I did for college, they said my family moved because I went to college, and therefore didn't qualify.

Obviously, my family got angry because we literally packed up and MOVED everything to the new state. Like EVERYTHING. We live here 100% of the state, sold our old property to buy a new house here... Etc. We've been fighting the university for a year now, and they won't budge. 

Can I take legal action against them?

Edit: I used to live in Arizona for 4 years when I was little, and my parents still have the house we lived in during that time. If I bring this information up, do you think that they would take it?"

"Mass Tort for non-Citizen? Can a non-American-Citizen and non-resident (who *was* a green card holder and NY resident at the time of injury and subsequent treatment, but is no longer) join a mass tort for injury (from a medical device, being tried in New Jersey)?"
"The company I'm renting from hasn't taken care of the mice problem in my apartment after I've reported it for months I have lived in this apartment in Michigan for a year and a half now. I am a college student renting for the first time, so I'm not really experienced with how all this service request stuff is supposed to work. 

Last winter, we had a mice issue. We called the property owner and sent in the work order. It was taken care of quickly and we didn't see them again until this January. We called and had them set traps and it was caught. However, shortly after this, more mice were seen running around. We repeated the process. No mice were caught. 

In March, I saw more mice and reported this. Someone came out to set traps, but after coming home from a trip to find droppings everywhere, I didn't feel comfortable staying in the apartment and I stayed with friends until a mouse was caught. I explained this to the property manager and asked if there was a way for them to reimburse me for the time I had to stay out of the apartment or the time I would spend cleaning up after it (it also chewed on the walls, doors, and desk in my room). I received 25 dollars in credit for laundry. 

Shortly after I moved back, I heard more scratching and kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye. For a month, I thought I was being paranoid, as I called in again and they said the traps haven't caught anything. However, today while I opened my oven door, I saw another mouse run between my feet and into my living room before making a dash for the hallway closet. I don't understand how they could have not caught these mice already, especially when I asked them again last week to set up more traps because I heard and recorded the mice chewing on the wall behind the oven again. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Aren't mice a health risk, especially in a kitchen? Is there a more permanent solution?"
"Can my parents stop me from getting tested from Covid-19? A backstory: I went to Spain a couple of months ago before Corona virus was prevalent.

However, I am a minor living with my parents. My mother says if I want to go get tested, I am not allowed to return home. Can she kick me out if I do get tested?

"I agreed to let a guy keep his boat on my property but he never picked it up. Is it mine now? I live in Washington state. I agreed to let a family friend keep his boat on my property two years ago with the understanding he was looking for a different place to store it. I never charged him anything to keep it here. I asked him to pick it up multiple times last year, which he never did, so it just sat neglected. He didn’t come by to work on it during this time and because it was poorly stored, Mother Nature trashed it. 
Recently, I decided to clean it up to see if I can get it to run. He heard through the grapevine that I’ve cleaned it up (with my own money and time) and now he wants it back. Is it legally his or is it considered abandoned property? I’m not sure if he has the title still, but I’m assuming so. The tags on the boat expired in 2017."

"No trust in the trustees Seeking advice. When my mom died of cancer her life insurance was put in a trust for me and my brother as a college fund. My two uncles and Grandpa on my mom's side are the trustees. Me and my brother, ages 20 and 21, are attending different schools, with me living across the state during school and my brother living at home. Part of what the trust is supposed to cover is my brother and I's living expenses throughout our college years. I live in dorms on campus during the school year and my brother lives at home, contributing to the rent. My Dad works all the time trying to make ends meet, but as a single father without my brothers living expenses contribution rent isnt happening. Our major issue is that the trustees, my uncles and grandpa living across the country, do not believe my brother should require living expenses because he is living at home. We struggle to pay the rent, unable to pay on time if at all. If it weren't for covid we would have been evicted by now. We have already lost our home last year to foreclosure, along with my Dad's vehicle.  There is a severe lack of communication coming from the trustees, which is heartbreaking because they're family. I am tired of struggling to make ends meet and I am tired of the constant threats from my landlord. What legal options do I have moving forward? Is there a type of lawyer who specializes in cases like mine?"
"Hired a lawyer with my ex with the understanding that we would split the bill; she has refused to make the last payment after we won our case. Should I pay and sue for the part of the bill she owes? **TL;DR: Just like the title says; this is in Maryland in Howard County**

So my ex and I have a kid and for reasons that are not important for this post the school district wanted to expel the child claiming fraudulent enrollment.  We decided to hire a lawyer to appeal and present additional information to support our case with the unwritten understanding that we would split the bill.

We split the $1,500.00 retainer and the second bill they sent us was for $1,300 and as soon as I got my copy (they sent each of us a copy) I gave my ex a $700.00 check to her name with “Lawyer’s fees” (same as with the retainer check).

We won the case and last week we got the last bill for $1,650.00, including $1,300.00 from the previous bill.  I called the lawyer’s office and they confirmed that they did not receive payment for the second bill they sent.

I’ve been emailing my ex asking if she paid the bill and she has not responded.  This bothers me to no end because this law firm did an excellent, professional job for our child.

So what options do I have here? I’m not a wealthy guy and I took the little savings I had to fight for my son and if I have to pay the whole thing I will do it.  Is there’s something that I can do legally to explain to this law firm that I gave my half of the money to my ex and she haven’t paid?

The bill is to both our names and my understanding is that legally this is my liability and I don’t want to damage my credit.  Is the best option to pay and sue her in small claims court?  I have copy of the checks I gave my ex if this helps."
"No bank can confirm my identity. I've been trying to start a bank account to deposit my stimulus check into nothing I do works though. Every single time I get the same message ""Sorry, we could not verify you"". I get the same stuff when I try to get my credit score, or do anything with my ssn. When I look up my credit score though I get a bunch of questions about accounts I never owned, and places I never lived. I'm only 19, have I already been a victim of identity theft or something?"
"My children's mother has a warrant out for her arrest and is MIA. I want to modify our custody agreement but there is no way I/the court would be able to notify her. What do I do? I will also mention that my mother also has custody of my children. It was done this way by CPS to avoid CPS terminating my exes rights and to avoid her doing anything drastic. She got to keep her legal rights but her physical custody was removed.  I had to relocate to a domestic violence shelter and it was not something I wanted to put them through so I asked my mother to take them. 

Now that I have collected my life and have been able to keep her away (almost 8 months now - which is pretty exciting) I want the kids to return to my custody. The warrant that is out for her arrest is also due to her breaking a restraining order the court had given me through criminal court. She was ROR'd and never showed up. This happened in January. 

What are the chances that this will be a difficult process given that no one knows her location? And should I expect any problems with the judge releasing custody to me? The only thing that concerns me is that the children have been with my mother for almost a year now. They're very young and I didn't want to pursue anything until I knew could support them like I can now. Now I feel like all I did was shoot myself in the foot.

Thank guys."
"Paying rent during redemption of foreclosure The house I am renting was aunctioned at the Hamilton Sheriff's Sales because the landlord failed to pay the mortgage. Someone else won over the sale by bidding. Now the house is in redemption period and she claims that she still owns the house because the sale is not confirmed and keep bugging me for the rent. She threatened that if I fail to pay the rent, she will broke into the house. I contacted the guy who claims he won the bid said that he is waiting for the sale confirmation. The Sheriff's Sales took place on 2/27. Does she have rights to do that? You hope someone out there has some legal advices about this situation.

I have a question surrounding liability and the act of god clause. I have a gazebo in my backyard that has been there 2 years now and had 12/12 stakes holding it in place and the other night the wind picked up and it hit the roof of our neighbors house. It caused some minor damage and destroyed my gazebo. We had a few people come gives us quotes and it was roughly $200-$500 for repairs to the neighbor’s roof. Our neighbor demanded we fix his roof right away (I would be pissed too). My question is: am I 100% liable for repairs to his roof or does this fall under the act of god clause? Should I just cover the bill or come to a better solution with the neighbor? I live in Idaho.
"Can my dad have me arrested hello, I am an 18 year old female living in New York moving to Connecticut.

My father can be a very crazy man and will go to extremes for the sake of his pride, because of this I am concerned that he will report me for theft as a means to keep me home ( since yes at some point he probably paid for most of my things ). I also have a $3000 refund check coming in from my university, and he has a card on file that has helped pay for part of my semester ( rich, controlling family that is why I’m leaving ), but the deposit is set to go to my account.

Registered for an LLC (California) but might not be able to continue with any other filing and fees. Do I leave it alone or is there a way to cancel? Long story short I registered for an LLC and at the end of March I got my “your LLC has been register” in my inbox. I haven’t filed any other paperwork or paid the $800 fee required by California but it looks like I might not have a job to pay for that. So what happens if I just leave it alone? Can I cancel the LLC? If I continue to have a job I’ll be able to pay it but if I don’t I think I’m in trouble.

"Military recruitment harassment This is pretty minor, but I (19f) got a text from someone calling themselves SSgt Scott form the Marines, asking if I would be interested in the military. I, admittedly somewhat sarcastically, replied “Hey there, Scott! Thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately, I'm not really the gambling type. Maybe contact me again when less than 50% of women get sexually assaulted while serving our nation! Thanks xoxo” and linked https://www.protectourdefenders.com/factsheet/

He then responded “Well since your in to stats tell how many sexual assaults happen on college campuses.” This… was a little upsetting. As someone who is a rape victim, and was sexually abused growing up (why it’s kind of important to me.) Implying that I shouldn’t go to college if I don’t want to be raped… that can’t be… to say the least, within etiquette? I’m not entirely sure this guy is with the military, as I can’t imagine they’d encourage recruiters to act like this, but if he is (or isn’t) is there anyone I could talk to about this? I don’t want anything drastic, but I’d just like to maybe report this to possible higher ups, if he has a history of such behavior? He is currently texting me to let me know my statistics are wildly inaccurate, and his reaction is getting increasingly aggressive. If he is not associated with the US military, I sure would like to get to the bottom of this. There is a history of sex trafficking in my area, and I’m kind of worried this is bait or whatever.

"[NJ] Discovery from criminal case doesn't include a referenced document, which is required for the evidence to be admissible. What's the best way to find out if it exists? In a felony case, the police are required by law to obtain a special authorization prior to doing a wiretap, or the wiretap is inadmissible in court. Their evidence includes wiretaps. The discovery includes reference numbers to the authorization for each wiretap. It also includes copies of the authorization forms for each wiretap, except for one. This is odd because (a) the prosecutor's case largely depends on this wiretap and (b) only its authorization is missing. So, most likely, the prosecutor forgot to include a copy of its authorization in the discovery. 

But, what if the prosecutor/police forgot to get the authorization prior to the wiretap?

How would someone find out whether that missing authorization form exists and, if so, whether it was created prior to the wiretap? It's reference number is known so looking it up shouldn't be hard. But asking the prosecutor for it directly may end up tipping them off that they've got a loose thread. At risk of being paranoid, could the prosecutor/detective could create a backdated version of the authorization?

The lawyer is an overwhelmed public defender. They can't be counted on to do investigative work."
"Update to post about landlords locking me out for not following unreasonable rules I called the police again, said again I was being illegally evicted and cited the law they were breaking, this time someone took me seriously.

I'm looking for a new place to stay hoping to find something quickly and that the current landlords make no drama with my security deposit and all. Thanks for your help"
"PPP loan through Kabbage is 10x what I applied and should be approved for  

Hello Legal Advice! Long time lurker here. I'm posting from a throwaway so that my inbox for my main account doesn't get inundated and all responses for this post are organized for me. Apologies if I overlooked any rules. I'm located in Washington State if that's relevant.

This will take a bit to set up so please bear with me. I've exhausted my resources for figuring this out so hopefully someone from Legal Advice can point me in the right direction. I posed in Personal Finance but AutoMod removed the post as they deemed it about small business.

&amp;#x200B;

When the lock down occurred for COVID-19, it significantly impacted my industry. I reached out to my CPA and Financial Planner for minimizing my expenses for the foreseeable future. At that time, the SBA had announced the PPP loan and applications for the loan through my normal credit union had already been maxed out. My CPA suggested using Kabbage and after doing some digging and verifying with my financial planner that Kabbage was legit, I went ahead and made an account to apply.

The application was pretty straightforward. It wasn't until after they reviewed and approved of my application that I ran into a major issue. My loan application was for \~$20k as that's what my max would be based on my income for the previous year. I have multiple screenshots of this amount. However, when Kabbage sent me the automated email stating that I was approved for the loan and that they were sending it to the SBA for final review, the loan amount they approved me for jumped to nearly $250k. I called Kabbage and they told me they found the issue (they stated on the phone call that it was an issue with how their automated system reviewed my documents - I switched from 1099 in 2018 to a W2 in 2019 as I set up an LLC to operate my business from. Their system apparently calculated my loan amount based on BOTH years). However, they stated that there was ""nothing they can do since their system approved it and that it's up to the SBA to approve or decline it"". Fast forward a week or so and low and behold the SBA approved this ridiculous loan. I called the SBA and after a few transfers, finally spoke with someone. Her direct response was, ""if the SBA approved the loan, it's yours"". I told her that the loan is more than 10x what I applied for and what I should be approved for based on the parameters of the loan. Furthermore, I explained that Kabbage is aware that they made a mistake but they can't change it and that they directed me to the SBA to make the change. She said the SBA doesn't have the ability to change the loan amount, only the ability to approve or deny it. I told her I don't want the excess funds, I only want what I knowingly qualify for. She restated that it's out of her hands BUT she stated that if I use the funds for my payroll, than there isn't an issue and it WILL be forgiven despite it being more money than I need. She cited the stipulations for the loan forgiveness direct from the SBA site, and despite my reiterating that I don't want that much money, told me not to worry and that I should take the loan. She instructed me to take screenshots of the SBA site's guidelines for the loan and to save them in case the SBA changes the guidelines in the future (so I would have it documented I guess).

So, I'm here wondering what the hell I should do. The \~20k that I know I'm qualified for would be really helpful, but I'm very reluctant to actually take the loan since I know the 250k is well beyond anything that I should have ever been approved for and I don't want to commit loan fraud. Does anyone have any idea as to what the repercussions of taking the loan would be? I was reading an article posted from Forbes a few days ago and they are now saying that all PPP applications are being audited and if the applicant knowingly takes out a loan through PPP that isn't 'necessary', it can have stiff penalties including up to 30yrs in jail and up to $1m in fines. All i want to do is lower the loan amount to what I know I qualify for, but I can't get Kabbage to take any steps towards changing it.

As an anecdote, I've documented the entire process since I noticed the discrepancy in loan amounts. I have notes that I took from the recorded calls with Kabbage and the SBA, emails sent to (but never answered) by Kabbage, and I have video and screenshots of my loan application to approval (where it literally says that my application for \~20k is approved, and 'to claim it and sign loan docs click continue', and on the next screen it says my loan docs for a \~250k loan are ready to sign).

edit: my sister does have a toddler in the mix. I would also not like anything to happen him as I love that child dearly (staying with out of town family atm) because there’s a chance that she could be taken to court for a custody battle with the father"
"Am I eligible for unemployment if I'm working? Stupid question but I'm a big dummy that doesn't know anything about anything.

So basically I was working two jobs before the world ended. One at a restaurant and one at a grocery. I got laid off from the restaurant (obviously) but I didn't know that they filed unemployment claims for everyone they let go. So tonight once I get home from the job I still do have I open an envelope to find a debit card from my state.

I don't want to even try to activate it because I'm scared I'll get in trouble. I have maintained employment at one of my jobs throughout all of this so I don't feel like I should be eligible, but the job I got laid off from did account for most of my wages so I am really hurting for any money I can get right now.

Do I have to call someone and tell them they made a mistake and that I need to be taken off? Or is this really as amazing as it seems?"
"I am impersonating a brand on Instagram, can they take legal action? I have recently created an Instagram account formatted identical to the one of a popular chain restaurant. Each restaurant in the chain has an affiliated Instagram, and we created one for our own city (which doesn't have one of these restaurants).  There are zero posts on the account and we are not slandering or misrepresenting the brand whatsoever,  but we have been accused of such. Within a day of creating the account,  a member of the restaurant's parent company sent us a direct message telling us to delete the account and that he reported it as spam. We aren't worried about him reporting it to Instagram, however, we are worried about legal action. Do they have the grounds to press charges towards us or even find out who we are (our identities were never mentioned to them)? My friend and I are doing this for fun and to pass time and would like to continue with the account for as long as possible, but we do not want legal troubles. Hopefully, we can get some advice, thank you. (this Reddit account is a burner for obvious reasons)

"GM deletes shifts to avoid overtime payments. DM has been aware for awhile and has done nothing. So I just want to start by stating this isn't happening to me but it is happening to the friends I made from my former place of employment, and they come to me to ask what to do. 

So to make a long story short I was the GM for a large chain, and when I left the company I maintained contact with a large group of friends from there. And when I left a literal shitshow began to take place. Most of things are small and petty and can be resolved by talking to the DM (and they have been). However a recent finding revealed something deeper was happening. 

In the beginning some people realized the person who took my position was deleting hours from the system to avoid overtime and she told them she would add it to a week where they were not at risk of hitting OT. Major red flag to me. So after listening to all of their complaints I sent an email to VP about the situation (when I left there was also a change in leadership for the area and I did not know contact information for any of them). The VP sent the email to the DM and she called me and I told her about the retaliation, the hours being cut, etc. She tried to butter me up and I wasn't really having it, so I told my friends what they need to do, keep detailed records, record conversations (one party consent state), and get as much in text as possible. 

Today one of the manager called my roommate and was asking about hours being deleted and the two got on facetime to look at the system to see how many hours were deleted and from who (and it was a lot. 5 hours from one person here and then another two there. Whole shifts deleted from someone) and to see the manager that deleted the shifts. They then called their DM (since this is about the GM) and sent a text. The DM already knew about hours being deleted due to the conversation she and I had. And had apparently done nothing about it. The GM states that when she finalizes payroll every week she looks at the schedule and adjusts the time to what they were scheduled to work and not what they actually worked during that pay period. 

All of their conversations have gone under the rug with empty promises. So I guess my question is what should they do now that everyone seems complacent in the hours being deleted?"
"current crisis prohibits me from using leased dormitory, would like to know possible remedy regarding my security deposit and/or admin fee if there are any tl;dr below

loc: Philippines

I am supposed to move in on the 15th for my review classes in June. However, due to this health crisis, I will not be able to leave my province due to the enhanced community quarantine (the leased space is located in another region next to mine and there is still no assurance when the quarantine ends because of extensions). In addition to this, my review school will be conducting online classes instead (for the first &amp; the mean time) which defeats the purpose of my lease. Since we believe that physical classes will be more effective for me, my parents decided that it is better to take the next schedule of review classes and licensure exam. This confirms that I will no longer need to lease for the said period (May-Nov). 

The company offers six month lease contracts (May-Nov/Nov - May) for reviewers. We are still looking to the possibility that they may allow the application of the deposit and the fee for the next period (Nov-May) although there's a small chance. 

Here are the significant provisions in the contract regarding this: 

The LESSOR shall have the right to forfeit the Security Deposit in the event that the LESSEE unitarillt pre-terminates or abandon this agreement prior to its expiry without prejudice to the other remedies accorded by law to the LESSOR. The Security Deposit shall act as Reservation Fee prior to actual contract date. If in case LESSEE decided not to continue the lease prior to contract date, said security deposit shall be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR. 

In case of back out, pre termination, or forced termination of contract, Lessee agrees that the said admin fee will be forfeited in favor of the LESSOR.

The LESSOR shall not be liable for any injuries or damage caused by any circumstances of force majeure. Force majeure is any event beyond the reasonable control of either party including, but not limited to, war, whether declared or not, rebellion, fire, flooding, and other natural calamities.



I am aware of the contract and have read the clauses properly but I am not sure how it will be applicable in this crisis which we have never encountered in years.


tl;dr: dont need leased space anymore due to the pandemic but already paid security deposit &amp; admin fee, not sure if i can transfer it for next period"
"Tattoo loopholes? Hi I’m F(16) turning 17. My mother wanted to sign me off for a tattoo on my seventeenth birthday but we found out in my state it’s illegal even with parental consent unless it’s a coverup tattoo, so I had two questions, If I did it myself or have a friend ( neither of us professional ) couldn’t I get that covered up? Or a different option was if I went somewhere where it is legal could I without my mother facing consequences since it was out of state? If it helps I live in TN!


I don’t need to be told not to get a tattoo. This tattoo holds a lot of meaning I just need legal advice not a scolding or anything lol"
"My Estranged Mom is Trying to Steal My Identity Hello,

I'm not very familiar with the legal system and wanted some advice on how to process. My grandmother who raised passed away a few months ago and I was in the middle of sorting things out with my family. In the middle of it I got an alert saying I had applied for a Marshalls credit card. The email that was used was my estranged mother's old name. She is a multi-time felon and constantly messages me and my brother and even stalked a close friend of mine each day at his workplace waiting to see me. I asked to void the application and the bank to send me details and I got so wrapped up with what we were doing that I never went to the police. Right afterward the pandemic started just as things finally settled down. I woke up this morning to another card from Discovery and this one was going through because she learned my legal name somehow.

How do I prove that it's her though and what would I need to show to convince them I have no relationship with her. She has repeatedly done things like this and I know if there isn't legal action she won't stop. I don't have much family outside of a rocky relationship with my dad and my younger brother. I'm scared and can't afford to have her mess up my adult life?"
"CoViD (Texas): My friends are hairstylists. If one of their clients unintentionally contracts the virus, can they be held liable? My friends are self employed. They rent small suites from places like [Salon Lofts](https://salonlofts.com/salons). Each of them have their own spaces, with lockable doors, and their own equipment.

They feel as if they're being *forces* to return to work, which will put their clients' health in jeopardy, but Governor Abbott decided that it's time for them to reopen, and he provided very little guidance for how they should proceed. Due to the absence of guidance from state officials, some of my friends consulted with ER physicians to establish procedures and workflows that will reduce everyone's exposure risk. 

My friends’ plans exceed what I've seen at doctor's offices, retail stores, and restaurants in recent months. Additionally, their plans far exceed the minimum standards provided by the State of Texas. But, they're still concerned that they'll be held liable if one of their clients contracts CoViD-19 from them or one of their locations.

Questions:

1. They're doing everything they can to protect themselves from the virus, but should they do more to protect themselves legally? 
2. Should they limit their clientele to adults and make each of them sign a waiver?

Note: This is what the State of Texas has provided:  [Minimum Standard Health Protocols, CHECKLIST FOR COSMETOLOGY SALONS/HAIR SALONS (Revised May 5, 2020](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/cosmet/covid19/OpenTexas-Checklist-Cosmetology-Hair-Salons.pdf)).

"Extortionate move out fee - New York rental agreement Our landlord recently sold our apartment and terminated our lease so we are being forced to move out. 

Due to Covid-19 the condo association sent a letter to the landlord requiring a member of staff to monitor the entrance and disinfect public spaces. The fee for this service will be $500.00. The landlord wants to charge us for the fee.

In our lease there is the following clause:
item 9 section B:  ""If the Condominium imposes any ""move-out"" deposits or fees. You shall pay any such deposit of fee when requested by the Condominium"".

We already paid $500 move in/move out deposit at the start of the lease. Is this additional fee really our responsibility given that we are not moving by choice? The fee is due to the timing of the move which was the landlord's choice. 

Is that clause legally binding given there is no mention of amount? What would stop them charging $5000? 

Thanks"
"Evicted by the Rona Hey, I had a situation come up and was told I could potentially get some advice here!

Recently, I was informed that I was exposed to someone who has Covid. After finding out, being polite I immediately told my roommates. They requested that I move out for 2 weeks to quarantine. I moved out as they requested. I got tested for Covid and was negative. My roommates talked to my landlord requesting me to be kicked out. I received and eviction notice “because I was exposed to covid and wasn’t getting along with the roommates” and was advised to move out by May 21st. I called my landlord to have a conversation with her but all she said was “you’re out” and hung up the phone. 

Now I am trying to get my things and just move in with my parents until I figure out where to live, but my roommates are not speaking to me even though I have attempted to contact them. Which is making the move out difficult.

My understanding was that it was illegal to evict anyone during covid as well as I feel as if this discrimination. 

Aside from all of this my landlord has also been skipping out on taxes by telling all who rents her house to say we are all cousins. I need help and do not know what to do with this situation.

Is what my landlord doing illegal, and can I press charges? Also is what my roommates doing illegal?"
"Just bought a home and a window has begun leaking I just purchased a home about 3 days ago and my wife and I have been painting it prior to moving our stuff in. We were painting today when it started raining kind of hard. Our window began leaking from the sides and the water bubbled up, underneath the paint. The paint around the windows is mostly ruined and about 1/2 a cup of water total leaked out. It leaked on both sides and across the center framing of the window.

It seemed like this was poorly repaired with either Sheetrock composite or regular wall putty because I could run my finger down this area and it was just turned to mush. I took lots of pictures and a couple videos of me running my finger down it to show they extent of it. 

There was no mention of a leaking window or any issues with the window on the sellers disclosure. After I had signed the closing paper work and we met them, they told us that a balancer on the window had broken and they sent someone to fix it one month from now. (It takes a month to get the part in, and it leaked above the window that had a broken balancer) I feel like these issues are beyond what they mentioned after we signed the closing paperwork. 

I informed my real estate agent of this and she is sending the videos/pics to the listing agent to see if they will be willing to take care of this. My question is if they refuse to fix this, am I SOL and stuck with the bill to fix this? Or is there some legal recourse to get them to fix this.

"Bitten by owners dog while working for him Edit: Bitten behind the leg by owners dog while working for him in Florida.

Background info: I was offered cash only to work at a construction company. I did not fill/ sign out an application or anything or any papers prior to working there. It was my first day working for them. 

I was sent to work yesterday at the owner of the company's place to restore his backyard. Towards the end of the work day while putting tools away, the owners dog (a pitbull) was sleeping behind a pillar of the house out of sight and next to where we were told to put the tools away. After my (brother)  who i was working with and I had just placed the tools down, we turned around to walk back to our work but then the dog must've have been startled or something because next thing was a growl and I was nipped by his fangs and was bleeding behind the knee and going down my leg. The owner of the company brought out a med bag and cleaned up my leg and apologized immediately and asked if i needed a hospital or anything but i told him i'm alright and that these things happen. He was clearly very worried throughout the whole situation. My brother and i finished our work and headed home and cleaned up my leg more. The nip looked a lot worse and than it was in our opinion. 

Fast forward to today (I did not work and stayed at home) and this morning my brother who was working today called and was messaging me that they wanted me to sign some forms and that they wanted to send them to my email after refusing to print them out and having my brother bring them to me after work. 
They sent two emails, one was a electronic signature forms that wanted me to accept and acknowledge them before even being able to view them (can't view them before accepting). The other email was supposedly a printable version of the forms but there was no attachment to the email so that was useless except in the email it says that I have to do one or the other (electronic or printable).  

I have not signed or accepted anything and I'm seeking advice as to what to do next."
"Please clarify something for me So my family has always been targeted by the school system. When my brother went they searched him relentlessly for drugs. It got to the point where he started doing cyber school. When I started going to the high school I found myself in the same spot he was in, I’d be called over the loudspeakers to come to the office where the school cop would be. I was searched multiple times a week. Then when I applied to the votec school for half the day I’d get searched there too in front of all my peers. I was mortified . I didn’t want to even go to school because I knew I’d be searched. It got to the point where they had me lift my shirt and also show them my waist band,pat me down and dump my bag and folders. I’d haft to clean up the mess they made and re organize all my stuff too. It was like they for sure knew I had something, and I never did I felt targeted because they couldn’t hassle my brother anymore. They also would fake dates that I “didn’t go to school” and send me to the magistrate where my mother had to pay hundreds for dollars in fines. We didn’t have money for that, we have always stretched a dollar as far as we could. My mother is on a fixed income and things have always been tight with money. Maybe it was because I dressed like a bum that they searched me but it was the best clothes I had. None of the teachers ever payed a second of time to me. I’ve now dropped out of school to try and make as much money as I can for my mother, even tho it’s only a few bucks an hour.   

Back to the point I saw a tick tock saying it is illegal to search a student unlawfully and there was a family who sued the school.  

Can I do the same? 

Please help me if you know anything on the topic. 
Much appreciated.

"Property management screwed me over So around February, I moved into a room that was being rented out. Long story short, the owner of that house hustled me and sold the building 2 weeks later and I was told I had to move out. I was pissed, but the company that bought the house offered a package that, according to the contract, would be $5000 if I moved by the end of April. 

But to avoid paying rent at a place I would no longer be living in, I ended up moving out on March 31st. But the first bullshit they pulled was saying that the contract was for $5k divided between all the roommates. Luckily for me, there was only one other roommate. So I could deal with $2500.

But my other roommate not only stayed, but he didn't pay rent for the month of April. I literally helped him move out at the end of April. They payed him the full $2500.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I waiting for my check and come to find out...they're going to deduct HIS non-payment of rent from MY paycheck. HOW DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?!? In the first email, they said they were going to ""check if there was damages to the apartment to assess costs""...mind you, I was living there for 6 weeks. He lived there for a month. Then they pull this shit?

"AZ; Minor Selling Drugs Brother (M15) has been buying selling and distributing weed, and apparently recently took on freaking cocaine and percs, and somehow got his hands on a gun/pistol I truly don’t know what kind or how. I’m so worried and frustrated and my parents have recently found out about this and don’t know what to do. He’s my brother, and their kid and he’s so young and stupid and doesn’t understand that what he’s doing can fuck up his life so we kind of don’t want to contact the police because we don’t know what we’d expect or if he’d be thrown in jail or juvenile detention. But the fact that my parents grounded him and took away the weed and did who knows what with it doesn’t stop him because now he has a new batch AND new drugs to sell. I’d really not want to report him to the police because I fear for his future and our family, we’re already falling apart due to our parents divorcing and this just really adds more fuel to the fire and I cannot continue to keep the family together I can’t keep being the glue, so if anyone has some solid advice to give I’d appreciate it even if it does mean reporting my brother because at this point I don’t know what to do besides cry haha"
"Aunt and uncle took advantage of my grandfather and potentially stole my inheritance Hi all, this is a long one, but I’ll simplify it the best i can. 

My uncle (U) is the son of my grandfather (G) who passed away in 2015. U is married to my aunt (A), and they’re kinda really... sketchy. 

U and A have filed for bankruptcy twice to my knowledge, and are really bad at handling finances (for the record). They’ve run more than one “business” that has failed catatonically. 

My grandpa had throat cancer, and was extremely out of it in the months before his passing. After my grandma (GA) passed in 2012, G gave me GA’s wedding band and told me he wanted me to have it because he did not trust U and A to not selling it. This was shortly after U and A’s bankruptcy. At this time G had no mental health issues, aside from his wife’s passing. He gave GA’s other ring to his first daughter for safe keeping for the same reason. U and A also had a small necklace that was willed to me by my great aunt and refused to give that to me for many years. 


In G’s original will I was willed either money or assets amounting to about $200k for college and starting my life. It is unknown if it was monetary or assets. Six months before his passing G and A were made to be his executor for his will, and two weeks before his passing his will was changed to where they were to receive everything and that no grand children would receive anything. 

U and A sold the family house, and moved to a lush home states away nearly immediately after his passing. They also have gone on several vacations and truly are living a plush life. 

It was stated by U and A that G “did not want it to be known of his passing”, which led to majority of the family not knowing of his passing, nor of his will being changed. It was not made known for over a month that he passed, and not until years later that his will was changed so soon to his passing. 

I can confirm these events and information with nearly any and all of my family. 

Was it legal of them to change his will two weeks before his passing? 

Is it worth following through with a lawyer?

What type of lawyer would one talk to about this? 

Advice? 

While that extra money would be extremely helpful I am more upset over the fact that they took advantage of someone who trusted them so greatly in his final moments. I want to go to college, but financially it’s impossible. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"
"[AZ] Facemasks So my employer(Food Service) has recently required that we all wear face masks at work. I’m all for it, I mean we work with food and customers so it makes sense. The problem is that she has required that we all buy and supply our own masks. It seems as though she should be providing the masks if she is going to make them a requirement. Is there any law about this? Just to be clear, I will definitely wear a mask regardless. I just want to make sure that I will have to be the one providing it."
"Pennsylvania unemployment currently owes me more than $4000 in unemployment money from the past two months, are they legally required to payout in a certain amount of time? Hello!


Short story, I've been on unemployment for two months and I've only received a total of two paychecks. The amount that the state currently owes me is over $4000 and I am struggling pretty hard with bills right now after two months of barely any income. 

Is there any sort of legal recourse I have for this? If there a possibility for some sort of class action lawsuit against the state if people get together? 

They got audited and were supposed to be implementing a new unemployment system but that was a few years ago. 

I didn't want to do anything extreme but after receiving a traffic camera ticket as well as a ""Pay $500 to reinstate your registration due to a lapse of insurance"", I'm pretty upset with the state right now. 

Is there any legal action I can take? I want my money and I try calling them every day I can never get through."

It lasted 2 weeks and i called it off, she was pushy, did as she wanted and costed me my job due to being way to tired, thats a whole different story. I ended it the beginning/middle of February, i told her why i ended it and she constantly tried to get me to stay, she constantly tried to contact my family members and i told her off from it and to leave us alone. Everything was well for 3 weeks or so then she tried contacting me again which ended with me telling her off again, i think it happened 2 other times and I just ignored her. She reactivated a 3 year unused instagram account to try talking to me(i blocked her on her 2 other accounts) then she just made a new account to thus yet again try to talk to me and she went to far with making a statement about wanting me to touch her, I deleted, blocked her and permanently deleted instagram to get rid of that communication to me.

"My dentist of 5 years messed up my mouth and it's going to cost thousands to fix it I don't know what to do about this. I went to a insurance approved dentist in Southern New Jersey for 5 years and had trouble with literally every appointment. Due to an accident I had to have root canals on both my front teeth. They didn't do them, but they did the crowns for them. They kinda forced me into doing them before I was ready and didn't explain anything about the process. I had a panic attack in the chair and they weren't empathetic at all. I have had nothing but trouble with my two front teeth. They kept falling out. They said I wasn't allowed to bite into anything and that I had to ""Princess eat."" Thing is I cut out things that I had to bite into and always broke down my food into smaller pieces and they still kept falling out. Before my first date with my now husband, during work, two days before my wedding... They would always fix it, but blame me every time. They're also cracked and they disregarded my concern and didn't fix them when I asked them to. They did a couple other root canals and there was always a problem. The last one they did it took 3 months to get the permanent in and I was there almost every week because the temporary kept falling out. ( Btw, the permanent fell out again tonight while eating bread) After the first year of being with this office, I tried everything to find a different dentist in the area but all my inquires led back to them. 

I went back to my old dentist as soon as my insurance changed and when I had my consultation he couldn't believe what had happened to my mouth in 5 years. He said all of my crowns didn't fit right and were loose. He said (and pictures showed) the backs of my front teeth were completely worn down by my bottom teeth because the bite wasn't right. When I told him about being told to ""princess eat"" he didn't know what that meant. He told me my crowns should be as tough as my real teeth, that there should be no restrictions on eating with them and it's never a patients fault when something goes wrong. I will gladly do whatever it takes to have him fix them. 

But I'm very upset that my teeth have gotten to this point. For him to have to fix 5 years worth of shoddy work makes me very angry. I've expressed that I would like to take legal action against my former dentist but I don't know if it's worth the time, money, and effort. It's going to cost a lot to get them fixed and I wouldn't have to do that if they did their job correctly. There are tons of other problems I had, emotional and physical but I only expressed the big ones due to character limit."
"Am I safe to sell my house after I was released from a Listing Agreement (Odd Contract wording)? Long story short, we had a real estate agent who just was not good and we decided to terminate our listing agreement with them. The bit in the contract that worries me says 

""If the property is sold within 120 days of expiration or termination of this agreement to a Buyer to whom the property was shown by Owner, Broker, another broker, or any other person or firm during the term of this agreement, the Broker's full fee shall be payable by Owner. The protection period shall be terminated if Owner enters into a listing agreement with another broker during the protection period. ""

From how I understand it, this means that since the agreement was terminated, that we're ok, but the whole ""120 days of expiration"" part is what I'm unclear on."
"Signed a Two Year Agreement but want out ASAP TEXAS

Last year, I signed an agreement with my current company. I'm truly tired of numerous things, including how my bosses have talked to me. I am unsure if I'm able to get out of the contract, because the language is very confusing. 

The last stanza of the agreement says, 

""By signing below, you also indicate your acknowledgement that you shall at all times maintain
confidentiality ofclient names, records, lists etc., and your agreement not to use this information for your
own benefit or the benefit of another person or firm either during your employment or after your
departure. You agree to a minimum 2-Year Commitment and if you decide to part ways from our firm, you will give no less than a 30-Day Notice. You agree not to solicit business from or provide services to clients on our client list for two years after you departure, whether or not you have worked on those accounts. ""

From what I understand, they are requesting a 30 day notice, but when I asked my boss about this clause before signing, they said, ""[it refers to] after the two years, as we will spend a significant amount of time training you"". Am I being tricked, or am I essentially being enslaved to the company? If so, is that allowed, are there ramifications to trying to break this?

Thank you for reading and your feedback!"
"Confusing Shared Work Claim Case CT/NY, Looking for Legal Advice Throwaway for professional reasons...

My company has filed for NYS Shared Work, effective 3/28. This program is a ""wage replacement"" program, intended to allow a company to weather economic downturns and replace layoffs with a complete wage cut of an entire unit. My company chose to cut hours 20% and not lay off any employees. I'm very thankful that my company has kept us all employed rather than choosing to lay off to survive this downturn. 

We were instructed to apply for the program and told we would have a 20% hours-cut, which NYS workshare would ""cover"", by replacing 20% of our wages with 20% of our weekly benefit rate on NYS unemployment. In addition to this, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program would kick in another $600 weekly, beginning the following week for anyone receiving funds from any NYS unemployment program.  This includes anyone on any kind of ""reduced hours"" program. 

It's prudent at this point to give some personal background and explain how CT comes into play. On 6/7/2019, through no fault of my own, I was laid off of my job in CT. I was fortunate to not have to use the entire 26 weeks of my CT unemployment benefits and began working in NY after 22 weeks of searching for a new position. Though my claim through CT ended when I stopped claiming benefits in October, the claim does not ""expire"" until 1 full calendar year from it's inception (6/6/2020). 

Last week (5/1/2020), I was contacted by NYS Shared Work and told that I would likely be found ineligible to claim NYS Shared Work Benefits because I had an ""open"" claim in CT with money remaining on it (as I had not used the full 26 weeks of benefits and 1 year had not yet passed). I was told I cannot have 2 ""open"" claims in 2 different states; despite my CT claim being complete and being for unemployment, not shared work. I got a follow up call today saying that this is the case and I am going to be denied NYS benefits and should see about claiming benefits through CT. 

I feel I am not going to be able to claim benefits through CT. As my employer is a NYS employer, it is not eligible for the CT Shared Work Program, even though the CT Shared Work Program will give an employee the same ""percent replacement"" of hours plus the FPUC payment. Additionally, the CT maximum benefit for unemployment while employed ""part time"" is cut by 2/3 of your gross earnings against the weekly benefit rate. In this case, someone earning over 970 would over-earn any money that the state would provide and thus make you ineligible for the additional $600 that the FPUA Program is providing. This is the situation in which I find myself. 

I feel like I'm in a massive catch loop here. I've circled unemployment law and see no legitimate reason for denial. I see nothing in NYS Shared Work under which I should be denied this claim. 

Is now the time to involve legal representation?"
"Friend’s ex surfaces two years later to demand items he left behind (CA) Hope I am posting with the right flair - it didn’t seem to fall under any other categories.

This is in California. My friend’s ex-partner (never married) recently attempted to contact her to pick up the belongings he left behind when he moved out of their (rented) property two years ago. They have had no contact since - neither reached out to each other about the left-behind items.

She recently moved to a new place and when she did, she donated the items he left behind (I believe it was a TV, retailing for about a few hundred now, and some Magic the Gathering cards).

He is now threatening her, and saying she owes him money for the items she donated. Does he have any legal recourse?

I’ve tried to do some research but the most I can find pertains to landlord/tenant abandonment of property, and she wasn’t his landlord - they were renting the property together until he moved out. They took turns paying rent until he moved out, they were both on the lease and when he moved out his name was taken off the lease (not sure if this all matters)."
"Ex-Husband who is a healthcare worker in the Seattle area wants custody agreement to remain the same The title says it all, but here are some details.

My ex-husband normally has our kids for about eight weeks over the summer. He lives just outside of Seattle and works in an Emergency Room in the city. Some texts sent by him heavily imply that he has been in contact with patients who have the virus.

He wants our custody agreement to remain the same, but I am concerned for the safety of my children. The number of cases in Seattle continues to grow and my ex-husband is at increased risk due to his job.
One of my children has asthma and I'm worried that he's at increased risk because of it. 

A few extra bits of info: as written above, he lives in Washington and I live in Idaho. All of the legal matters were settled in Idaho.

Any thoughts on what to do?"
"Getting a name put on house deed Not sure if this is the right tag. 

My dad is wanting to put his name on the deed to my grandparents house because my grandfather isn't mentally all here and hasn't been for decades and my grandmother had a stroke in March and my aunt's are taking care of legal needs etc. One aunt has guardianship over grandma's finances etc. 

We (my husband and I) live with my dad and grandparents and they moved grandma into one of their houses for care because they live in a bigger city with hospital and physical therapy etc so it's just easier.

Well the aunt with legal guardianship over grandma's finances has been acting weird and kinda shady and we are afraid she might try to essentially evict us and sell the house or something.

We are thinking if dad can get his name on the deed it'd be harder or they wouldn't be able to pull that crap. Could dad with grandpa's signature or proof he's his caretaker get his name on the deed? 

Relationship is strained between us and the aunts. One of the reasons we don't trust them. 

We know grandpa's name is on deed but not sure if grandma's name is. 

Location: Indiana USA."
Unemployment for Self-Employed Owner Figured I’d post here to get someone’s legal perspective on the matter. If a self-employed business owner is eligible for unemployment and earns income but the income doesn’t offset their operating costs are they still eligible for unemployment assistance.
"Breaking my lease but the leasing agency won’t give any confirmation of it Hey I’m in the US, Georgia specifically. 

I signed onto a year long lease with a property management company last September and ended up getting a new job out of state and am trying to move out at the end of this month (May 31st). According to my lease, I have to pay a $570 fee to end the lease early and give thirty day notice.

I gave my notice in a letter (I have a copy) on April 24th (a little over 30 days) indicating a move out date of May 31st and included a check for the $570. Their office is closed to the public due to the health situation going on so I’ve been having to drop off my rent each month in a drop box attached to their front door. The employees are still working, they just don’t want people to be coming in and out obviously. I turned in my May rent on the same day and that check was cashed, but the $570 check hasn’t been cashed yet. 

I’ve called and left two messages and have each message recorded and sent an email, but I haven’t gotten any confirmation back from them.

Is there anything I can do to make sure that I’m not held responsible for any further fees/rent? I’m worried that I won’t get a response back and I’ll be held liable for more money even though I’m trying everything I can to get in touch with them and get confirmation of the move out date."
"Should I hire a lawyer for a not at fault car accident 6 months ago I was involved in a car accident getting T-boned by a 87 year old woman who ran a red light going 50 mph. (Yes, she received a ticket for running the red light) 

My car sustained $5 grand worth of damages and was in the shop for close to 3 weeks. 

I went to the Er, CAT scan etc. Bill before insurance was $31k (Insurance deductible I owe $3k) 

Missed 2 weeks of work due to muscle pain which my othor specialist believed I had 3-4 herniated disks. MRI ordered and no herniated disks found. 🙏

3 weeks of physical therapy and 5 chiropractor Vista later I am feeling better and did NOT involve a lawyer. 

The settlement offer is $4500 and my $3k medical expenses paid for... seems a little low considering pain and suffering is only around $1100? 

Should I get a lawyer?"
"Desperate and Strange Civil Assault Advice (Nebraska)  

Hey, all. I don't know how wise turning to reddit is, but I'm feeling kind of desperate. Quick preface, I live in a very small town. Also, my mom holds a respected position in the city's government.

Anyway, My mom decided to pay me a visit this past monday night. She had heard from someone that I relapsed into drinking, and wanted to come discipline me or something (I'm 24 btw.) Around 9 p.m. I was asleep on my couch, she came into my house unannounced, despite being intoxicated herself. (BTW Her doing this revealed that she had the extra house key that I've been missing for a while.) I told her to leave, but she refused. When the verbal fighting escalated into yelling, and she still wouldn't leave, I tried using force to get her out of my house. I really just tried pushing her towards the door. She then ran to my kitchen, and grabbed a knife. When I tried approaching her again, she started slashing the knife at me. She did injure me. Nothing life threatening, but I did need to get 5 stitches on my left arm, and I have a long knife wound on my abdomen. She then said, verbatim, ""I'm calling the cops, and they will believe whatever I say."" She then left, got into her car, and drove away. I immediately called 911, told them what happened, called a friend to meet me at the ER, and walked to the ER (The hospital is literally right across the street from me.) Cut to the ER. A doctor is questioning me and stitching me up. Two police officers then arrive. One starts questioning me about everything that transpired, and the other starts questioning my friend about IDK what. I'm thinking he was taking my report statement, but then he asks if I had her phone and glasses. Apparently she dropped them when running to her car. I didn't have them, and the officer quit asking me questions, but neither of them left. The doctor then discharged me, and started walking my friend and I to the exit. As soon as we got there, one of the officers took my discharge papers from the doctor, and the other one arrested me. ARRESTS ME. Apparently my mom also called 911 and told them I hit her and refused to let her leave my house, assault and false imprisonment, which are both being charged as felonies. My friend, the doctor, and all nurses nearby were shocked. The doc even started arguing with the arresting officer. He doesn't even read my rights. Now, I have a lot of potential unstable depressive mood disorders. So, I start screaming, and crying, and yelling suicidal thoughts. The officer tried booking me to the jail, but the jail counselor, who thank GOD was actually there, told him to do an EPC interview with a psychiatrist. I qualified to be taken to a psych ward. I stayed there until today, when I was released. Instead of having to sit in jail I just have the citations. I'm still scared, however, because since I've been released, 5 hours ago, I've been stopped by police several times. They ask if I'm drunk, and one asked if I was someone who had just shoplifted at a nearby store. This all sounds bizarre, but I'm scared to even leave my house. My mom has done similar things with lying about people to the police before, and theyve gone to jail and even prison! Are there any legal actions I can take to fight this, or do I just hide in my house until court? This is very crazy, but I sincerely hope somebody has come advice for me. Much love\~

tl;dr My drunk mom assaulted and told the cops I assaulted her. Now I'm charged with felonies, despite me being the victim. None of my town's officer will listen to me."
"A roommate on lease eviction in USA Georgia. So basically we split the rent 3 ways and take turns paying the rent each month cause it can only be paid from one account. The roommate we want to evict hasn't paid in 4 months which lead to us owing a little over 5,000 to our apartment complex. A part of this is money we sent to him to pay the rent, but it wasn't used to pay the rent because the time he said he paid it wouldn't go through. My sister and I have paid our portion that we have to take the number down and it is currently 3600. Mind you 1600 of that 3600 is money we sent to him that was supposed to use for rent. We want to evict him the quickest way possible but we also want to sue him for the money back. Because currently courts are closed due to the coronavirus but when they open, which is soon, our complex will file to evict us. My sister and I plan to pay the rest of the balance so it can stay off of our credit and we wont get kicked out-- but doing that absolves him from the responsibility. So we want to sue to get the 3600 back that we are getting ready to pay to resolve this and we also want him out. Our lease has 3 more months left if that matters, but we want him out regardless. How can we evict him while keeping this off of our credits and also doing it legally so that when we sue nothing can be used against us? We live in the state of Georgia and sorry for any typo's I'm in a scramble atm to find out what we can do."
"FWB got pregnant. Need Legal Advice. Hi all, looking to seek advice as I am unsure of what I can/should do.  To give a bit of context, I have been seeing this FWB for a few months and she claims she was on contraception ( birth control) and we have been having unprotected sex (stupid yes I know). Recently, she contacted me saying that she was pregnant. Us being not ready for such a big responsibility, I told her that she should go for an abortion instead. However, she is insistent on keeping the baby no matter the consequences. I am currently studying however she has dropped out of school. I have tried to talk to her about us not being in the right capacity to do us currently but to no avail. Right now I am really concerned regarding legal issues such as Child Maintenance, etc; as I am not financially stable myself. Would like to seek some (legal) advice on what I can do and how should I proceed with this. Please no hate comments, I have understood the severity of my actions and I would like to know my potential actions."
"Question about living with parents So if I live with my parents as an adult over 21 in massachusetts, do I have any legal recourse against immediate, and I mean IMMEDIATE eviction? I dont pay rent, but I provide childcare, housework, and yardwork. I have been kicked out of their house too many times to count and am just wondering if I have and legal cover here. Also would paying rent in terms of monetary compensation for room and board, no matter how much it is, afford me any additional legal recourse in the event of being told ""get out now!""? Thanks"
"Scam or am I really going to be sued in civil court? I get a call from a ""third party"" and all they can give me is a phone number and a reference number.

I give them m y birthday and they tell me the last 4 numbers of my social and read off a few addresses from the past. 

According to my credit report I don't owe anything to anyone. The lady says she can give me one more day until they go ""further"". The supposed balance is now $841. It was past 5pm EST when I got the first call so I couldn't contact the hospital's collection department but I intend to tomorrow morning. 


Is this a scam? They are threatening to garnish my wages and tack on for penalties if I don't comply by tomorrow. I'm in Kentucky.

Any advice? Thank you!"
"American in Mexico, finalizing work visa sponsored by place I no longer work Hi, I hope this isn't a repeat of a previous/similar post. If so, I apologize.

I'm an American living in Mexico, and before COVID-19 hit I was in the process of getting my work visa. My contract states that my place of work will cover all visa-related costs, and my visa was approved on February 21. I was supposed to go to the US and meet with the consulate to finalize the process by April 7. I had an appointment and plans to go in early April, but by that time, travel was restricted and I was unable to leave Mexico safely. Since that time, I've been laid off from my job and I'm unsure if I'll be getting it back or not.

Now, I am starting a new part-time job (still in Mexico) but I still would like to finalize my Visa process. As all costs of obtaining this Visa (a lawyer, all documentation, plane tickets, etc) were paid by my previous place of work, what rights do I have in finalizing that process now that I have been let go? My employment contract includes full coverage of those costs, but my contract was also supposed to last a year. Since my contract was terminated early (though due to no fault of my own) I'm not sure if my contractual rights pertaining to the visa still apply. Plus, they've already spent the money to cover all the costs of my visa, so not following through would be a loss to them, as well as to me if I have to start over again.

TL;DR - Can I still finalize my work visa sponsored by a company I no longer work for? Or do I need to start the entire visa process from the ground-up? Also, due to COVID-19, will the consulate honor my paperwork even though I was supposed to have had my appointment with them by April 7?

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the long post."
"How to request my deceased mother’s medical records? My mother died when I was thirteen, from Angiosarcoma, a rare form of cancer. I was not kept in the loop about her medical care, which is understandable, as I was quite young at the time. I am now twenty-nine and I often wonder about her diagnosis, treatment and ultimately her death. I’ve researched the type of cancer she had, but I’d really like to have access to her medical records to better understand her personal experience and hopefully get some closure. Is this possible? If so, what legal action would I need to take in order to begin this process?

Update: My mother died in Alabama. I currently reside in Wisconsin."
"Disabled vet laid off Texas: I was laid off in March and offered 1 month severance; employee handbook stipulates 2 weeks’ severance. CFO, CEO, and my VP were aware I collect disability payments from the VA and belong to a protected veteran class.

VP of HR won’t negotiate severance. I tried to decline the severance offered in exchange for the 2 weeks from the EH so I can retain the right to bring suit and discuss my experiences with the employer for people in my network who ask. VP-HR said the EH severance requires indemnification. I’m okay with that because I can still lodge a VEVRAA complaint with the DoL, but want to retain the ability to discuss my poor treatment.

"Is parking spaces leased, licensed? Car towed (CA) Los Angeles, CA. 

I park on a first come first serve parking lot. I last drove my car on Monday. I discovered that my car was towed on Thursday. The actual towing happening on Wednesday. Management, sometime between Monday and Wednesday put up signs that declared no parking. About the same time, put two conflicting notices in my mailbox which I did not discover until Thursday. It said no parking Wednesday. The other notice said no parking Thursday. To add to the confusion, with words they said no parking on N side of the lot, with a Map, they circled the south Lot. A neighbor took a picture of the sign in the S. of the lot that said Wednesday.

I transferred from one apartment to another in the same complex. Parking is limited to one per residence. I have a parking permit sticker on my dash that was applied and given at my previous apartment with an expiration date of 2021. When I went to the tow yard, I have discovered that the tow was authorized by the maintenance supervisor. Who listed the reason for the tow was ""Permit did not correspond to unit"" He went to my previous residence looking for me (I assume he didn’t have access to my file, but did have access to the parking permit file). They did not call me. On my lease, the following is the only thing mention about parking,   
 

*“Only vehicles with currently valid parking permits issued by X may park in lots located within the X Development. If parking spaces are assigned, Resident shall only park in their assigned space.”*

So my questions are,

1. Did I have a valid permit if it was issued during the previous residence?

2. Does it matter that I renewed my lease 2 months ago, and on the lease it listed the permit number that was given during my previous residence?  Does this make it valid?

3. Did I have a lease, license or easement to the parking space?

4. How much notice am I entitled to? Can they modify the agreement with 1 or 2 days notice? And did they have a duty to ensure that I received the notice? Does it matter that I did not get the notice until Thursday? Does it matter that they went to the wrong apartment to give notice in person?

5. If the parking space was leased to me, did the towing of my car require an eviction remedy therefore causing this to be a wrongful eviction?

6. If my permit was a license, was my parking permit suspended without me having received notice, and is that valid?

7. Do I have a case and what cause(s) of action can you think of? Trespass to chattels, wrongful eviction?"
"Cancelled bicycle insurance without telling insurer now demanding £50? I've cancelled direct debits for other things with no comeback but only services not for goods I've bought.
Had a threatening letter saying I owe £30 for missing a £5 payment.
I thought screw that you can fuck off but then read an old letter quite clearly stating the charge I thought doh! What an idiot I am.
So now as time has passed they've cancelled my policy stating I owe the 1 missed payment for £5, £30 for the late charge, and a £15 ""Fee for each drawing if your account is cancelled due to your failure to comply with the terms and conditions of your agreement""

Technically I never missed a payment as I just cancelled the policy completely.
What makes me feel even more stupid is that the annual cost of the policy is around this amount.

Any suggestions on what I can do? Is there much chance of them chasing it up through the county court for such a pissy amount?"
"[MD] My mom passed away a week ago. Her apartment complex wants my address. As stated above, my mom passed away a week ago. Ever since then, it’s been a blur. She didn’t pay for May. The complex said we could go in and get my things, and that the money would come out of her deposit at a daily rate. It averaged out to $50 per day, so we decided to just get my items cleared out this past weekend. I’m not a tenant there, I didn’t sign the renewed lease. However, I lived there when I first moved to Maryland and still had belongings there.

On Sunday, there was still a bunch of things left in the apartment, but the dump was closed. It was cheaper for them to charge the estate for hauling it out rather than us going back two more weekends, paying the dump fee, etc. 

I got an email today from the apartment that asked “Can you provide me with your address to forward along any remaining deposits for your mother should there be any?” 

**Should I give them my address?** Do I legally need to? What would happen if I gave it to them?

I don’t want them to charge me for an apartment that I haven’t lived in for a year and a half. It’s almost $1k for the clean out fee alone. I can’t afford that at all. I’m fully expecting to get nothing out of the estate; she didn’t have a will. She had debt galore though, so they’ll eat up the estate.

Thank you for any help!"
"Divorce lawyers death I looked in the divorce groups and don’t think that’s the place to post this.

"Canceling a Lease In Ontario, Canada A while ago I had signed a standard form of lease in Ontario Canada for a 3 year long period. I had intended to cancel it after a year because I only needed to live there for 8 months. Turns out I had initialed a section in the contract where I acknowledge that in order to set a termination date at August 27th, 2020, I needed to have submitted an ""N9 Tenant's Notice to End the Tenancy"" form by January 15th, 2020. This deadline is yearly, so the next time I could set a termination is January 15th, 2021 to be terminated at August 27th, 2021, forcing me to pay 15 months of rent at a place I am no longer staying at.

The section detailing this was barely a paragraph long and I was told to initial plus write the date just next to the statement, no signature. They just wrote ""There are no exceptions"" and that the N9 form ""must be hand delivered"". Can a landlord even set when an N9 form is allowed to be submitted? How do I combat this?"

However, yesterday a bill was posted for 2 credits to my account, and when I asked the office about it they said that there was an error and that starting this semester the 2-credit courses I took were going to change to 3-credits a piece, and now they're charging me for the extra credits which comes out to over $1000. This is after my semester has already ended and already paid for everything, and from the point that I registered for classes up until yesterday these classes were displaying as only 2 credits. Can they go back and retroactively change this and charge me?"

"CPS came into my house and the police are charging my father, now my parents are extremely upset and my mom says she will go back to her country and take me with her, what can I do? I'm a 14 year old who lives in New York and recently had CPS come to our house. My father has anger issues, he would constantly hit/beat me, argue with me, punish me, and yell at me to the point I am depressed and have though tof suicide as young as 10.

After CPS came to my house, me and my parents were taken to a police station to be interviewed, and I told them all the things my dad had done, one of these things was that he frequently groped me on my rear end. I told them I did not feel safe around him. After the interview, he was temporarily forced to move out and tomorrow they are going to decide what to do with him.

Ever since this my mom had been extremely upset about this and told me if my father was arrested or even not allowed to see me, she would immediately go back to her country and take me with her, and if possible then go to my fathers country to continue our family there (my parents are both immigrants, I believe what my father did will get him deported). She also told me she ""might become suicidal"". I am terrified at the idea of this, as my mothers country, Uzbekistan, is much worse than here, and so is my fathers, Ecuador. Not to mention they want to ignore the fact my father, who abused me, isnt allowed to see me.

I'm extremely frustrated about all of this and my dad is saying he has done nothing wrong for 20 years, and I suddenly ruined everything. I only wanted for my dad to be removed and to live with my mom, but she does not understand I do not feel safe at all around him (anger issues) and that I have asked many times (for years) for him to be more fair with me. She either wants us together as a family or for us to split apart and go to an entirely different country.

TL;DR: My father can get deported for sexual abuse to me, we live in New York. My mom believes I should forgive my dad and that he is a good person, he just has mental issues (that he never sought help for despite being able to). My mom says she will go back to Uzbekistan and I am going with her. She says she might go to Ecuador (with me again) to be with my dad again.

Im sorry this is extremely long and kind of a sob story more than an actual question. I just feel like I need to give as much context as possible, since this is something that will change my life and I need to make sure I am making the right descisions. I am also sorry this technically takes more than just one flair. If you can help me, I just have a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a chance my dad will not be arrested/deported? What about not being allowed to be near me?
2. Are my parents even allowed to carry out this plan/Will they even be able to carry it out?
3. If I tell CPS what my mom wants to do, will they do something about this? Will she be charged too?
4. If I get removed from my parents custody, will I be able to ask if I can be placed in my boyfriends/one of my friends homes (whos parents are non abusive)? I have no relatives in the U.S. who are willing to take me in.

I'm not expecting for all of these to be answered, in fact even if just one person gives me just a little bit advice on one of them I would greatly appreciate that. Thank you for reading this.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your advice, I highly appreciate this. Today they are going to decide what to do with my father, and I'm going to try and tell them what has been going on as soon as possibly. 

EDIT2: My dad isnt being taken away. My boyfriend lied about a few things. Pretty sad but things could have been much worse. I told my agent about my moms plan and she said my mom would be allowed to do it. As much as I hate being with my parents, I'd rather be with them, who begged they would not bother me if nothing happened to them, than with my mom in a country whos language I cant even speak. I appreciate all of you for your advice, but sadly they dropped the case entirely just because I told them there werent marks. My dad will have to go to family therapy with us, so hopefully things will get better."
"[CA] ""Rent Service Fee"" Missing in lease agreement Landlord is attempting to charge a ""rent service fee"" through the third party that they charge utilities. After emailing them, they claim it is for utilities, not rent. Although the invoice I received clearly reads ""rent service fee"".

LATE PAYMENTS AND FEES.** Owner and Residents agree that it is and will be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages suffered by Owner in the event Residents make a late payment of rent, or when Residents make a payment that is subsequently dishonored by the bank, but the Parties agree that Owner does, in the event of late payment or in the event of a dishonored check, incur certain costs, such as additional bookkeeping and administrative charges, bank charges, lost opportunity costs of the late payment. After making a reasonable endeavor to estimate accurately the approximate costs associated with such a breach, the Parties agree that the below charges represent a reasonable approximation of the damages Owner is likely to suffer from a late or dishonored payment. Owner and Residents further agree that this provision does not establish a grace period of the payment of rent, and that Owner may give Residents a written notice to pay or quit the Leased Premises in accordance with State law at any time after the payment is due. Owner shall have all remedies under the law and this Agreement in the event Resident fails to timely pay the rent or other amounts owed. At Owner's sole discretion, Owner may report any delinquent rent or other amounts owed to a credit reporting agency.

They pointed to the utilities section as the one allowing the charge, see below. They also told me to contact them, but I didn't sign any paperwork with this third party, the lease is with my leasing office.

...

&gt;**11. UTILITIES.** Unless the following is modified by a separate addendum to this Agreement, Owner agrees, at Owner's expense, to furnish the following utilities to the Leased Premises: None. Residents agree to pay all charges (including utility deposits) not supplied by Owner, assessed by the utility provider or Owner, or Owner's designated Billing Party in connection with Residents' use of utilities during the term of this Agreement, or the period of occupancy by Residents, whichever is longer. During the term or any renewal period of this Agreement, Residents shall not allow utilities to be disconnected - and shall pay all utility bills on time. Residents shall not waste utilities supplied by Owner. Residents shall properly use all electrical, gas and plumbing fixtures and appliances. Residents shall not install or operate any additional equipment or appliance including but not limited to additional refrigerators and freezers, a dishwasher, washing machine, clothes dryer or an air conditioning unit in the Leased Premises unless supplied by Owner or with Owner's prior written approval. Residents will be responsible for the following utilities: Electric, Gas, Water, Sewer, and Trash.

Do I have a leg to stand on here?"
"(WA) - Deposit questions Hello.  I recently moved out of an apartment complex and the property management company is saying I owe almost $500 because they replaced my carpet.

Now this isn't a normal ""What are my options?"" post.  This particular case has some interesting things involved.

1) originally I was sent a spreadsheet of what it would cost to move in and there is a line item for $1400 as a ""Security Deposit"" and a $250 ""Non refundable deposit"" however the lease itself only mentions $250 deposit, which I've never had an apartment have one that low.

2) They say that the 1400 was applied to rent and noting it in the excel file was a ""Clerical Error"" and the lease trumps all.

3) The person who signed the lease on the company side was later arrested and is currently serving jail time for forgery and theft.

4) I thought that the deposits covered all ""normal usage"" and I can't imagine why it needed to be replaced, it was replaced 2 years ago when I moved in.

5) Part of the move out fees they are associating is two months worth of bills, because they back bill by two months?  Is that a normal thing?

Do I have a leg to stand on if this goes to court?  Should I get a lawyer?  If they offer to just call it a wash, should I take it, or should I fight for the full 1400?

I already have a request to talk to the company's regional manager and a meeting with my bank tomorrow to gather all my payment records.  But anything else you all could help would would be amazing.

Thank you in advance

"My dad lied about his assets during mediation, is there anything my mom can do? I’m typing this on account of my mom who isn’t really good with tech stuff, so I don’t have all of the details immediately ready. Also! This takes place in TX. 

My parents got divorced in July of 2019 I believe. Throughout my life, my dad spent his time cheating on my mom, emotionally abusing and gaslighting her, and ruining her reputation with our neighbors by telling them she’s crazy and whatnot. Anyways, during mediation my mom got pretty screwed over by my dad. They both agreed to be fair, so she didn’t try to take any of his material items or pension. In return, she was supposed to get the house that we’ve lived in and everything in it, minus a TV and the tools. He also agreed to fix a few things in the house that were broken, but once it was time to go he just...got the fuck. 

During mediation, my dad said that his assets were significantly less than they actually are, that he made less than he really did, and that he hadn’t bought a new house yet. It turns out though that he did buy a new house way before the divorce was settled, and he had taken out a 200K loan on it. She also found out that he put a few of his assets in my uncle’s name (his brother) so that she wouldn’t touch them. It also turns out that my mom was only supposed to have 2 years left on our house to pay off, but my dad got a big loan on it right before the divorce, so now we’ll be here for maybe another 20? 

Aside from the things that happened during the mediation, my dad has stolen quite a few things from my mom. Personal paperwork, jewelry, and money. But she has no solid way to prove it. 

My mom was told by her lawyer than once mediation is settled, there’s nothing you can do about it. I was wondering how true that is? Is there anything that she can do?

Thanks."
"Wife takes all money and three kids to Idaho My brother and his wife got an eviction notice in california. So my brother's wife packed up her car with the kids, and withdrew all the money and put it into her separate account and left to her cousins in Idaho. My brother had no choice but to follow along. They've always had a troubled marriage and were in the process of separating. Upon arriving my brother regretted following and wanted to come back, but could not due to her holding all the money so he started lashing out verbally more than usual, which they both are keen to do to each other. (My post history shows their volatile personalities)

So his wife filed a protective order, but he has already come back to California. He has not been served, but informed this order exists. However, their stimulus check arrived to their old address so my brother was able to pick it up, and she now wants to meet at a bank to cash it, but my brother is hesitant because of this protection order to drive back to Idaho and meet up with her.

She has written up a contract with stipulations she wants him to sign and have notorized in exchange for dropping the protective order. He is also hesitant to trust this.

Does anyone have any suggestions on if he should trust her to meet at a bank with this order in place?"
"Unpaid US Speeding Tickets for a Canadian I am an Ontario, Canada resident with 2 unpaid speeding tickets and a 3rd that is awaiting a court date in the US.

The first was in Tennessee in 2007.

The second was in New York in 2012.

The third was in West Virginia earlier this year.

While I admit that not paying speeding tickets is stupid, I feel I should mention that I'm not some reckless driver. All of these tickets were relatively small fines for going around 10 - 12 mph over the limit, two of which were in mountainous areas where I just got caught going a little too quick.

After the first ticket in 2007, I was told by someone that US speeding tickets didn't affect insurance back home and that as long as I wasn't pulled over in that same state again it wouldn't matter. I decided to take this chance since I felt avoiding Tennessee would be fairly easy. I did this same thing in New York state while obviously taking some more risk. 

Now I can confirm that these tickets did not affect my drivers rating back home as I have renewed my car insurance several times since the first two tickets and have always had a perfectly clean record.

My question is, do states ever write off unpaid tickets after a period of time? Would it ever be safe again to get pulled over in say Tennessee after 13 years without fear of arrest? Or New York state after 8 years? 

I tried searching online but most of what I found was on various travel websites with 'do the right thing' information. I get that I should have paid the tickets, but how do things really work?"
"Would I be entitled to half the equity when my name gets refied off my mortgage? Bought a home with my now ex. Contributed everything to the down payment, and just want to know if in the act of refinancing the home i would be entitled to a cash distribution of half the equity in the property? 

I'm in WA state if that makes a difference. Was thinking this would be case but also the act of refinancing the loan doesn't really result in a cash distribution, so was unsure how that works"
"Police attempted to serve harassment prevention order at old address (MA) I no longer reside in MA, however one of my parents just called and told me an officer tried to serve a harassment prevention order. With the current situation I do not feel comfortable traveling back to mass. The officer told my parents that I could either pick it up at the station or they would continue to come back.

"Division of assets. Hey
Going through a very tough time in my life right now. Had to charge my SO with domestic violence.i have temporary possession of the home right now since I have the kids. I have to decide if I want to keep it. I was approved for legal aid and will get a lawyer next week. But I can't stop myself from wondering. If I wanted to keep our home; we would need to divide it correct? I'd have to pay him half of the value? I have always either worked only part time and just recently began a licenced day home because I always needed to watch the kids. I don't have savings. I don't make a ton of money. Can legal aid help cover your half of the cost or do you need to qualify for half the mortgage through the bank? Sadly; I wouldn't qualify for a mortgage since I'm considered to be self employed and haven't made a ton of money doing it. :'( any tips ?"
"Bully commercial landlord - Trying to claim damage to property. Where do I stand? KC,Missouri I signed a month to month lease in an office port. There is no deposit. There is no mention of move out condition expectations in the lease. We did not do a walk through when I moved in. She wants to charge me for hanging pictures/ nail holes. Kansas City, Missouri.

 I moved to this office from another within the same building. When I moved from the first office, the landlord tried to charge me for damages. I proved they were existing. She dropped the demand. 

With nothing in the lease, no walk through upon moving in, and no deposit to recover... In addition, I have proof of her prior attempt to charge me for false damages. What do you suggest that I say to her?"
"Applied for apartment, got the lease and now the prior residents may not move out? OK, here's what happened.
I live in Texas. Iv rented a few apartments in the past with no problem. No huge issues anyway.
My boyfriend and I applied to an apartment complex, got approved and we were waiting on the lease.
The person who was working with us on this at the time of scouting for the apartments said ""oh yes! I do actually have an apartment that you'd love and it's in your budget"" sweet right? We saw the unit In person, hardwood floors, washer dryer hookups and it's a first floor unit of 750 square feet and the rent is $881.
Awesome dude. So fast forward, we apply to the apartment, get approved with all your regular fees, admin etc.
We paid for the application and what not and they said yes that unit is locked in for you for that price.
A couple days pass. No lease.
We call and call and call then finally after a week we get the lease. There was a few discrepancies with the lease so I called the office to ask about it.
She said we'll, those residents are actually thinking about staying in the unit. I panicked honestly. Our move out date is June 10th.
She said even tho they could still stay, our move out date is still June 10th, to go ahead and put in the notice for these apartments we are in, and to pay the admin and all those fees. The apartment we get just may be a second floor or something.
My questions are, how can she guarantee a unit for that move out date. Should I pay those fees without a having signed a lease there yet? And is this even right? This has never happened to me before but also they're reason for staying is because of the pandemic.
So I understand that. But how do I know they won't do this again with a different apartment?
I'm so confused. We still haven't given notice to our apartments because we don't know what to do. My dad's advice was to just say screw and go find a different apartment complex. Help."
"Best options for recouping the cost of vandalism to my car I'm using a throw away. I home that's ok.

I was at work tonight when I saw a lady pull into a parking spot. I noticed her but didn't pay much attention until I heard the commotion. She was standing in the parking lot yelling and throwing a cell phone, I couldn't really make out what she was yelling.

I find the non-emergency police number in my phone and dial it. we've had the police out before for odd random incidences. So she keeps telling and getting louder, she was yelling at some man, I'm not sure if they were together.

They tried to come in the store, the lady yelled at me to call the cops, I told her they were already on the phone. She immediately knocked over a stack of baskets and a product display right next to the door. I yelled ""that's it, get out, we're closed""

at first I thought they were having some type of argument about a relationship but the guy got in his car and drove away and the girl just sat down on the sidewalk. At this point the police dispatcher had told me that police were on their way. Things settled down for a few minutes. Another customer came into the store and as I was milling around they told me she was throwing rocks at our company cars. 

I started videoing with my phone. She was throwing rocks from the parking lot at our company cars. Then she turned and started walking toward my car. I kept filming. She threw a rock straight at my car and it broke the little triangle window behind my driver door. At that point I flipped, I went out side and screamed in my deepest voice for her to stop and leave, she leaves the parking lot. I see her walk into the drugstore across the parking lot. 

At this point, I am on the phone with 911, a couple minutes have passed since she went into the drugstore and a hand full of people come running out. She caused some terrible ruckus in the drug store, the police arrived shortly after and arrested her.

The police took my name and info and a statement, he gave me a card with his email and I sent him the pictures of the damage to my car and the video of the woman damaging the cars, I have not received an answer yet but this all happened earlier this evening.

This is the first car I've ever had a payment and full coverage on, I think they might cover the damage but I'm pretty sure my rates would go up and I don't want that. I'm angry as hell about the car but the thing that pisses me off more is the idea of paying higher premiums for something SHE did to ME absent ANY control I would have had over the situation.

Would it be a better route to pay to have the damage fixed out of pocket and just sue her for it? (It's not just glass breakage, there are also big chips in the paint and creased dents down to the metal.)

A few years ago, a truck hit a different car while it was parked in a lot and I wasn't in it. The driver ran off. Long story, none of it matters but i didn't make an insurance claim but I asked my insurance provider if my rates would go up if my car gets totaled in a parking lot like that completely absent my input. He said yes, even in that case my rates would go up. That's why I don't want to make a claim.

Forgot to add location, I'm in Kentucky USA and because of that, to register my car in Kentucky, my insurance specifically had to say it was a Kentucky policy."
Regulations on car seat modifications My grandpa recently died and left me and my family members some money. I’ve considered buying a car to work on to pass time this summer. I’ve been thinking of a Volkswagen Bus or some other older van type cars. One of my projects i’d like to do is to add seats sideways in the back (backs against window area). Along with this is thinking about the legalities of it and driving it on the road. Are modifications like this allowed?
"Girlfriend contacted by old friend. Old friend says her boyfriend threatened violence on neighbor when drunk, has history of assault. My girlfriend and I were chatting on the phone when an old friend of hers from college (who I'll refer to as friend) asked to call her about something. It was out of the blue, and my girlfriends birthday was the other day, so we thought it was for that and she switched calls. As my girlfriend describes it, the friend was calling for advice about her  (the friend's) boyfriend. The friend and her boyfriend had gotten drunk, and the boyfriend made a threat of violence against the friend's/her boyfriends neighbor. The friend did not mention the specifics of the threat, but said that it did not seem to be a joking threat. The boyfriend has a history of assault. The friend mentioned that her boyfriend has expressed anger towards the friend during the conversation. My girlfriend asked the friend if they felt like they (the friend) was in danger, and she said no. 

My girlfriend and I are in Wisconsin, and the friend and her boyfriend are in New Mexico. Given that the boyfriend made a threat and has not actually been violent towards the neighbor, and seemingly the anger he had towards friend hasn't manifested as abuse (according to friend), is there anything that we can encourage them to do, or do ourselves? (aside from encouraging them to look out for their own safety)"

"YouTube and copyright... So I basically created a YouTube channel where I basically show compilations of cool video clips from places such as Reddit, Instagram, TikTok etc. And I was wondering if I would get copyrighted for doing this. My channel is kind of like ""Daily dose of internet"" and ""EmKay"" mixed together, where I show cool clips from the internet, and do basic commentary, such as describing what is going on and adding some jokes here and there. Would I have to ask and get permission for all the clips that I am going to use in the video? (there's like 15 clips so it would take ages to get permission from everyone, and in addition, I don't even know if the video clip poster is the ORIGINAL original creator of the clip). 

FYI, I don't really have any footage of my video right now, and I also live in Australia, in case the copyright law changes depending on where I live."
"What steps do we need to take before moving to another state? My wife and I have been married for 10 years and we have a 14 year old from her previous marriage. My wife has sole legal custody of our son and his father has liberal visitations. I won’t go into the child support aspect because it is a joke and I don’t think it’s relevant to the question at hand. 

We live in Illinois. Approximately 7 years ago, the company I work for wanted to relocate me to Michigan. My wife asked her husband if we could work something out and he said it would be fine.  Just so there would be no funny business down the road, we filed for a court date and my wife, her ex-husband, and me all went in-front of the judge.  After telling the judge why we were there, she seemed to be confused as to why we were there if all parties agreed.  She signed the ruling that said we would move to Michigan with our son. 

In the meantime, the company went into the tank and I got laid off. I found another job in Illinois but 1.5 hours away and we moved. That was just over 5 years ago.  Since we moved my wife’s ex-husband has attempted to be much more demanding and controlling. He believes he has a right to spend at least every other weekend with his son and even goes as far as to say he can take us to court and demand that we drive our son the 3 hour round trip every weekend so he can see him because we are the ones that moved away. I know he is blowing smoke and this would not happen but it does get to my wife at times. 

One time when her ex was making his threats, I discussed this with a family attorney (in a social setting not a consultation) and asked what “liberal” visitation mean. He told me that it means whatever my wife decides it means and that there would be nothing to do unless her ex files a suit. He told me that he has no legal authority to do anything the way the custody agreement is written. 

Now, an opportunity has presented itself that I might have the opportunity to transfer to Missouri. This transfer would be beneficial to both my family and my career. I am wanting to know what we need to do, if anything, legally.  Our son is 14 and if he had to go in-front of a judge, there is absolutely zero doubt that he would say he wanted to stay with his mom and I. He does not have the best relationship with his father and definitely feels like a pawn in some sort of game of control over his mother. 

Since we have a ruling to move to Michigan, does that mean we have to file for another court date and have a fight on our hands to move to MIssouri?  If so, what steps do we need to take?"
"Work Place Advice Hello everyone, Advice please USA

Do not want to get fired but fear retaliation don't know what to do. This is currently going on so any advice would be greatly apricated and I'm new here.

My team lead is a very charismatic female that only wants to work with an all male crew, she has said several times she cannot work with other females, guess what gender I am. I've tried throughout the years working with her,  but the side comments, snips, and constant well I'm going to ask so and so continues.

Well last week I had to have a meeting as I had to fix a data file and get things back running per management that has been down a month. Well, since program changes I had to redo much of the work had issues, and did a group meeting as others asked me to. During that meeting I presented much of what issues I had, advised I had to make these changes if you wanted it to work this weekend. No hiding, took a day off and went back to work. By weds email sent out from the team lead to whole team accusing me of sabotage etc., which now affects working relationships.  Previously I have made several complaints of being excluded as always holding things on my day off with her excuse of only time available. Management allows her to get away with this, and she knows how to have other back her up on the team.  I've gone to senior manager but this is still keeping me up at night as she continues to keep digging but in a side manner which many males don't pick up on, so she can get away with it.

What do I do? Should I make it a point on my day off to re-talk to my manager advising that this isn't settle and he needs to do more, as right now she has all the power.  I cannot work for a vindictive person but this isn't the first time a bully was able to get away with things scot free with him.

I need this job to keep my daughter alive, but I don't need to work for people like this or continue to be subjected to this type of environment and allow it to be encourage. She has been this way since she was only temporarily suppose to be in charge but its been years now.

She has been doing this for a few weeks now, and before her getting everyone's ear we were all ok, could joke and talk. Now, that she has another coworker (male) that can do what I do she has really been pushing me out."
"what can i do if my landlord is demanding i pay more than what i owe? (TN) i’ve paid about $500 of my rent for the next few months, which can be seen very clearly in my bank account history. i have a screenshot of it, and i’m able to show anyone in person if they asked to see it for themselves.

"My friend’s boss told a public livestream with 500+ employees that she had tested positive for coronavirus, sharing her full name and medical information without her consent. I’m sharing this for friend who doesn’t have Reddit, but who needs some advice. I think this would be considered a violation of her privacy, and an infringement on HIPAA, among other things, but that seemed most pressing, so that’s how I tagged it. Edit: I don’t think that HIPAA applies her. It seems to be a common law privacy issue (public disclosure of private facts).

Some backstory, my friend has been working from home since mid-March. She’s been staying home for just as long, ordering groceries, etc. Last week she got really sick, shortness of breath, a deep cough, fevers for days, body aches. She was tested for covid-19 on Saturday and just found out it was positive today. Luckily, she’s recovering and is doing much better. 

Here’s her text to me:

“I let my boss know that I was sick last week with symptoms of coronavirus and was going to get tested. I only let him know this because it would affect when I would be able to work, since we‘re planning on going back to the office later this month. 

Today, during a Facebook Live on his page, with about 500-1,000 viewers [including many coworkers and clients of the company], he let everyone know that I was sick and got tested for the virus (said my first and last name as well). I have this on recording. Several people tagged me in the comments, which notified my followers and my grandmother found out that I was sick this way. 

Then once I let him and our COO know that I tested positive, he and our COO let a few other employees know that I tested positive for the virus, even though they’re not supposed to share any employees medical information.”

Obviously she is upset, as this is a big deal and a very touchy subject. He shared her first and last name in a Facebook video (which my friend has recorded). Her poor grandmother found out in freakin’ Facebook, before she’d even felt comfortable sharing with some friends and family. This was her personal information, to choose for herself who gets to see it, and he boss and COO shared with with no regard for privacy twice.

She’d like to know what her options are, any advice for how to deal with this, does she actually have grounds to move forward with this legally? Really anything would be helpful! Thank you in advance!!

When I spoke with NATIC they told me the policy wasn’t in the system but they would follow up with the agent and get back to me. I called the agent and left a message with a secretary. A few hours later the president of the company called to tell me somehow my Title Insurance was never filed as my attorney never submitted the documentation. They said they would get it fixed when he got them what they needed. So not only did my Attorney mess up elsewhere he didn’t even file my title insurance that I paid for at closing 10 months ago. I was told at the least I need to file a complaint with the bar association. I also want to file against him for messing up my closing and not fulfilling his legal obligations. I worry this could be a regular thing. Did he ever purchase the policy on my last home purchase in 2016?  I’ve left messages and spoken with many attorneys whom won’t help at all. What would you do?

I am in North Carolina 

Thanks!"
"NYC - Health Risk Legal Advice Greetings,

Hope all is well. I'm currently employed by a large telecommunication company.  Our main job is to host events.  Within these events, we interact with clients heavily, sell products  and migrate them to our platform. At the moment we are being force to go outside in the streets in an uncontrolled environment where we can't control social distancing or any aspect of the new  mandated state laws due to the COVID-19. I feared for my family and my own health. 

They have very little regards for their employees health concerns. I wouldn't want to take the unemployment route and it seems like they are given us an indirect ultimatum.  I'm looking for  some assistance/advice how best to approach this situation from a legal stand point  of view. 

Can a case be brought up in court, and if so, what type of documentation is needed?

Cheers'"
"A confusing Business Law question that has had me stumped for a while now about general partnership Hey guys! I have a question about a general partnership and ownership claims. So, there’s two partners who have run a rental company, and they have agreed that one of them receives 1/3rd of the total revenue of the company, while the other receives 2/3rds. The man who is receiving 2/3rds on the income attempts to fire Sarah (the other owner). Sarah claims in court that he is breaching their oral agreement as parters, and thus is seeking to claim half ownership of the company. If they have agreed for her to receive 1/3rd of the total revenue, then can she still claim half ownership? She runs the business just like he does, so I would assume she is an owner too. Or can she only claim 1/3rd ownership since that’s what she receives in revenue?

"Security Deposit Over Charge So towards the end of March (right before quarantine was enforced) I moved out of my apartment (in Colorado) to a new apartment (in Colorado).  I've moved plenty of times and my experience has always been about the same: about a month or two later I receive an itemized list for cleaning and damages and, if the landlord isn't terrible, a little bit of the security deposit back.  This time, I received an itemized list of cleaning and damages that was around $400 higher than the security deposit I had already paid with a note asking that I ""remit the balance immediately.""  They want me to pay them $400 more after I have already moved out.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I already have a semblance of a plan as to what to do about this.  Some of the itemized charges are blatantly against the lease and I believe I can negotiate with them to bring the charges back to the total of the security deposit.  I won't lie, I left some holes in the wall and I never expected to get the whole security deposit back.  It would be nice to get some of the money back, but if the security deposit is my payment to never deal with these people again, I guess that's okay.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my questions: is this even legal?  Can you charge someone more than their security deposit?  I've never heard of this happening and despite my best google I can't find anything.  It feels predatory and ridiculous to me but the last thing I want is this to go to collections and ding my credit score.  Any advice is much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information that I have no clue if it will be helpful:

&amp;#x200B;

This is not the landlord I originally signed the lease with.  Management changed a few months before I moved out.  I signed over the lease and I can't find anything that suggests anything wasn't done correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked about a walk through a week before the move.  Because of COVID, they declined.  It looks like Colorado doesn't require a walk through and I'm feeling now like I should have insisted."

"Seeking advice regarding a brand new car with engine problems, possible lemon law claim I bought a brand new 2018 Ford Escape SE in June 2018 with 350 miles. After 11 months my car started to jerk as I was in reverse. I took it to the dealership (June 2019) that I bought it from to have it looked at. The coolant was low, so they topped it off and told me to keep an eye on it (this was a Thursday).  On Monday my car started to do the same thing, I checked my coolant and it was almost empty, so I called the dealership and they had me bring it back that evening.  They found that my coolant was draining into the engine, and stated that Ford was going to buy me a new engine.  The dealership had the car for 6 weeks. At this time my car only had 24,000 miles. I also found out that it was being rebuilt not a new motor.  I got my car back in the middle of July.  

The middle of August my car started to ride a little rough, so I again called the dealership and told them. I took the car to them and at this time they stated that they needed to do a computer update, I had told them that my engine was moving when I put it into gear and I thought that it may be a broken motor mount. 

In October I was rear ended so my car was in the repair shop for 4 weeks (Mid October-Mid November).  At the beginning of December I called the shop that repaired my car from my wreck and stated that my car was running rough and wondered if there could have been front end damage at the time of my wreck.  They contacted the dealership and took it to them, which they found that it needed a new motor mount (which I originally thought in August).  The dealership ordered the part and would call me when it came in.  

About a week later the part came in, and the day before it started to jerk again when I was reversing.  I checked my coolant and once again it was very low (below min level).  At this time my car now has right under 30000 miles.  I took the car back to the dealership to have the motor mount fixed and informed them the coolant was low. I expressed that I wanted to look into the lemon law because my car was doing the same thing that it had done before. I was informed that Ford would not do a buy back without trying to repair the car again. At this time they did a redesign rebuild engine which took another 5 weeks.  I got my car back in the middle of February 2020.  

A few weeks later I noticed that my cars start/stop had stopped working along with the traction control.  I looked under the hood for some reason and noticed my coolant was low again.  I contacted the dealership at which point we are on a first name basis and took it to them.  At first they were on board with filing a claim through Ford. They checked the car over and stated that I had a coolant leak but they were not sure where it was and that I needed an update for my start/stop. This was not an engine issue so no claim was filed.  

About 4 weeks ago I had to call because my car was making a rattling noise when hitting bumps. So again I took it in and they found that it had a loose wheel arm that needed to be replaced due to being off so many times, that was then replaced.  All was well until 2 days ago and big shocker my car engine is now making a knocking noise.  When looking it up it would appear to be a cracked block.  

A back story, when purchasing the car i was $4000 upside down in the car I traded in.  From my understanding if Ford were to buy back the car they would not refund the purchase price they would deduct the use of the car/mileage/etc. I have paid for this car for almost 2 years and now owe right at $24000, the car blue books for around $16000. (It now has rear end damage on the title) I cannot trade it in or I will be in worse shape than I started. If I do nothing eventually my warranty will run out. I put approximately 25,000 miles per year on my cars in the past.  So at this point I am at 36,000 and my warranty will only be good for about another year.
A person buys a new car to not have the worry, all I have had is issues for 11 months. 

What do I do? Do I contact a lawyer and bypass the dealership? Do I contact Ford directly? Thank you in advance for reading."
"My friend married someone here illegally Good Morning. My original post was removed. I am assuming because it was too long.

We live in New York State, United States. My friend married someone who overstayed his Visa by 13 months. They have started the process of him getting a Tax ID so he can legally work here. They are married, have joint bank accounts, have had their interview with Immigration. Can we still report them?

UPDATED BECAUSE PEOPLE ASKED WHY: WHY we would want to report him was in my last post that was removed :|

He has been a toxic part of her life - driven a wedge between them and her family and friends. He has gambled them into thousands of dollars of debt, has been regularly doing HARD drugs, and she has done them as well which was the literal antithesis of her.

Additionally - he was pulled over driving her vehicle and was charged with a speeding ticket, a ticket for pot, a ticket for driving without seatbelt, among other charges.

We don't really see any way to separate them because she married him knowing he had been $10k+ in debt to a bookie and he did not stop. We think she has stockholm syndrome honestly and an intervention needs to happen.

"Europe: Shared apartment, just discovered our apartment on Booking.com Europe-Poland

So I've been renting a room in a 5 bedroom apartment for 3 months so far. When the quarantine started all the other house mates have left and I've been the only one here since. I've just discovered that the landlord has the apartment listed on Booking.com as a short term room rental. 

Where do I stand here legally? I'm renting a room which states in the contract that I'm responsible for the shared areas. I had noticed before we had people move in and leave days later and now it makes sense. 

I'm worried because if someone books one of these rooms, I have belongings here, food in the fridge etc as I live here and these people would be treating the place like a hotel. 

What legally can I do about this? 

Thank you"

Bad roommate My roommate is moving out of a house we leased and has paid half of the rent with the agreement that she did not have to pay any utilities while she is moving out. We have leased furniture that is under her name but we have split the payment. She is trying to take all of the furniture even though I’ve been making payments as well. Can I get half of the furniture? She is also bringing someone to help her move. The person makes me feel uncomfortable and I do not want her in my house. Can I report her as trespassing if she enters my home? I told my roommate that it was fine if she waited in the driveway it was fine. Would I be able to label her as a trespasser if my roommate is still on the lease? She said it is illegal for me to hold her on the lease. Can I be sued?
"Victim of hit and run accident today, what do I do next? Hey guys, 21 year old male from NY.

Today I was driving my yellow Hyundai in the right hand lane on a main road where I live. A red kia soul was a little infront of me in the left lane. All of a sudden the red kia decided to cut in front of me and turn right to a side road. I inevitably hit him on his right side, he continued driving and stopped a block away. He got out to look the damage. I got out to ask him to come back. He started freaking out and was seriously angry and I felt threatened. About 10 peoples from the surrounding houses, cars, and businesses all came out to my 'rescue' and this guy got back in his kia and drove off. I had the cops come and me and my 2 passengers gave statements, and 2 witnesses idle at the red light of the intersection who saw the whole thing gave statements. The whole event was on multiple cameras, and the police officer pulled up the video and told me that the red kia was at 100% liability. My car had to get towed as it was not able to be driven. After the whole event I get home and about an hour after the impact, I start getting neck pain and one of my passengers is dizzy with a headache. We both go to urgent care, I cat x-rays and cat scans and am told that I have pretty bad whiplash in my neck and back, and that my muscle strain is equivalent to someone days into whiplash, so it'll get bad. The doctor told me not to work for 4 days at least, and if I do go back be very careful (I'm a cashier). My passenger has a mild concussion and is told to rest for a week and avoid mental strain. They are scheduled to start a new job at a children's orphanage home as an intern next week. I call the police to update my report with our injuries, they inform that a woman called about how they were involved in a hit and run. They said that a yellow car hit them dead on and drove off. They also said this occurred on the opposite side of town from where the accident actually happened, AND they are trying to blame me for all of it. She also said she was driving her red kia, with her boyfriend and her mother as passengers. That wasn't even true, the boyfriend was driving the car, and the mother was the only passenger. The police officer told me they knew that they were blatantly lying, and that the hit and runners would be coming into the station and be charged with hit and run from personal injury and submitting a false police claim. He also told me that they are clearly at 100% fault. This whole ordeal took up atleast 7 to 8 hours. This all took place on camera and the red kia is obviously at fault. This is also during the middle of me and my passenger's finals week at school, and we can't think straight. We're scared to drive or even ride in a car, it was both of our first accidents and it was very traumatic. We are both very anxious in general and this is the last thing we needed. 

Phew... that was the story. Hopefully you're still with me. My question is, what are my next steps? Should I sue them? I emailed a personal injury lawyer, but I'd hate to have to spend money on all of their work or time and then find out I have no claim to anything. I don't really know how suing works and I would hate to get in trouble, or reverse sued or something like that. I mostly want justice for the whole ordeal, this guy looked very scaring and threatening and I'm honestly worried of retaliation if I pursue legal action. What do I need in order to sue him? Is it worth it usually? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully I managed to make it a somewhat interesting read.

Thank you so much for anything.

Edit: forgot to mention, not sure how important this is. But my dad said since she called the police that likely means they have insurance, and the reason they want to file an accident report is for their insurance claim, and that they probably didn't expect me to call the police since I was such a young kid."
"My emplloyer laid me off for Covid. Now that he has a PPP loan he is hiring me back, but paying me on jobs that he already owed me for before laying me off. Is this legal? I work on a job to job basis but I work enough that they have classified me as a full time employee. He laid all of us off a month ago, but one of the stipulations of the PPP loan is that he has to hire us back if he wants the loan forgiven. He owes me thousands of dollars for past work that hasn't paid out yet and he's informed me that his plan is that I will be paid for that past work while I am hired back. This seems illegal to me. As far as I can understand the CARES act requires employees to be hired back and paid at least 75 percent of their Q1 earnings. What he seems to be doing is paying me for my Q1 earnings and claiming that he's still employing me even though I have no work that is going into billing. Am I wrong in thinking that he's taking me off my government assistance so that he can grab his and not have to pay it back? Also do I risk prison time if I go along with this? Should I report it? This seem like fraud and that it might be a federal crime. Any advice? Any particular kind of lawyer I should see about this? Oregon by the way."

"My sister stole my car, but the police won’t do anything. Are they being negligent or am I overreacting? So for clarity, I’m 19 and my sister is 23. The car is in my name, not my parents. My sister doesn’t have a license, she was high on meth when she stole it, this is her 2nd time stealing one of the family cars, and she had another person (I don’t know who they are yet) in my car driving it as well. She returned it, she didn’t crash it or anything. She did it in the middle of the night and kept it for 6 ish hours, and she would have gotten away with it if I didn’t have dash cam that recorded everything. 


I know she was on meth because she said so in the footage, she also told the other person to keep quiet about it, and how the car belonged to me and not her and if they wanted to use it again, then they can’t let anyone know. The other person also left their backpack in the back seat, which contained a  inhaler and a container that very clearly had weed in it at one point. I’m not sure if they actually did drugs in the car, because there’s a moment when they turn the car off and nothings being recorded, but I know they had sex because they left a condom wrapper in my 1 year old daughters car seat cup holder.

When I went to the police station, told the officer everything, told them I had dash cam, and also said that our family was worried that she had someone living in our RV (we have a 3 acre property with woods in the back, where we keep the RV. She’s had people living in there before.) The officer never once asked to look at the footage, or offered to have someone inspect the RV for unwanted occupants. They said that as of that moment, there were no charges that he could press, and that he would call me if they wanted the footage. When I asked about the backpack he told me to “just throw it away” but then changed his mind and decided to take it because if the container actually had something in it, then he didn’t want me caught with it. 

That was basically it. Dad finally mustered up the courage to check the RV himself, he didn’t find anyone but there was evidence that someone had been living there. He locked it up. My sister has pretty severe schizophrenia (was developed about 3-4 years ago) if it holds any importance. Upon hearing that I knew she stole my car (she doesn’t know the police was contacted) she stole my brothers bike and left, and returned without the bike. My brother doesn’t want to report it for personal reasons, despite my encouragement."
"Landlord Causing Problems Hi everyone! Also posted in r/advice. Here’s the story: 
Before COVID, we had extended our lease from end of April until end of May. After COVID, we no longer needed the extension because my boyfriend and I would not be physically graduated and we also aren’t working as we are non-essential. We asked the landlord to cancel the extension and he said no. 
That’s fine, we tried to find someone to sublet, but no luck. 
The landlord was able to find someone that was interested so I sent videos of the apartment and also emailed with the prospective tenant at the request of the landlord. They even came and toured while we waited outside. Now, the prospective tenant has backed out. 
They were supposed to move in May 15th, and we were told our move our day was to be May 10th and that the rent would be prorated. This is written in an email. Most of our belongings are out and in a storage unit already. 
We have yet to pay May rent because we were waiting for the prospective tenant to sign the lease but now that they backed out, our landlord is asking for rent for the full month. We don’t have that money. 
So, what do we do? What is legal for us to do? Do we just pay for the 10 days or will our security deposit be taken? Please help!"
"Property management company wants to charge back rent for a pet. [MA] We live in an apartment complex where they typically charge extra for pets. ($20-$50 depending on the size of the pet) When we first moved in October of 2018 the then-manager waived our pet fee for the duration of the year-long lease. 

Last October we wanted to renew for 6 more months (November 2019-May 2020) but the company couldn't get their online resident portal to accept the terms of our lease. We paid our rent in the meantime(and have never ever been late on our rent in the year and half we've been here) although we were not technically under lease at that point. Not really the point of the story, but we were showing some good faith.

When they finally got the portal to accept the 6 months instead of the 18 they initially had put in, they had raised the rent by 3% due to ""property improvements."" (They redid the roof in July.) At this point it was November 20, and our lease had run out at the end of October. I pointed out the hassle with the lease and how it made me uncomfortable, and they decided to waive the pet fee again. HOWEVER, I did not specifically get ""we are waiving your pet fee"" in writing. 

What we did get was a lease where the rent is disclosed thus:

""6.Rent and Charges. Unless modified by addenda, you will pay $1100.00 per month for rent, payable in advance and without demand at the on-site manager's office, or at our online payment site, or at the leasing office"" There's more in that portion about late charges but that's it. 

We signed on November 26, and they counter-signed on December 2.

Now, fast forward almost 7 months, we have found a house and are closing mid-June. We notified the office in April of our intent to vacate after June 31, and got a confirmation email saying the same, and that no paperwork needed to be done as the way our lease is worded, if you do not notify of your intent to vacate at the end of your lease, it is assumed you are going month-to-month and accept a 10% increase in rent. 

During the covid shutdown, some of the tenants have organised a rent strike (we are not taking part and have continued to pay our rent on time) and the property management company has responded by offering a 10% discount on May's rent to anyone who paid their April rent on time, and a $50 discount on May if you pay May on time, and a $100 discount if you pay June on time. Not generous, but you can see how it might get complicated. So, to total that up, we paid 940 this month for rent. 

This discounts threw the resident portal system into complete meltdown, everyone got outstanding balance warnings, the management company sent out a disclaimer saying ""yeah we know you got warning notifications about your rent, we can't change that part of the system or else it will break."" Now the company has had to dig through the balances and accounts individually to calculate if each person has paid their appropriate rent for this month, and contact each of them.

Lo and behold, our account has a balance of 299.45.  That's $160 from the discount that the system thinks we owe, and 7 months of pet rent at $20/mo, less $0.55 from interest gained on our deposit that they just took. The person in the office sent out a pretty aggressive email to my wife asking her to pay the whole balance, first denying that we were entitled to the discount because the $140 balance made us unqualified for any of the discounts. They relented on that after a few emails from us decrying the lack of any notification of the balance being accrued over the 7 months, but still insist we owe the pet rent because we don't have anything in writing that says ""it was waived."" 

Now, I looked into the pet addendum in the lease and it says:
 ""4. Additional Animal Rent. Your total monthly rent (as stated in the Lease Contract) has been increased by $20.00 by your request to maintain an animal in the unit. The monthly rent amount in Provision 6 of the Lease Contract includes this additional rent. This amount is not a deposit and is in consideration of our allowing the option to maintain and animal."" Nowhere else on the addendum does it say anything about monthly charges. Other addendums in the lease have applicability/conflict clauses where the conflict is controlled by the addendum, but the animal addendum does NOT. 

Therefore I sent an email with both of those quotes, pointing out that the animal rent was included in our rent, and in our interpretation of the lease we have fulfilled the contract. I also stated I was willing to discuss what other ways ""includes this additional rent"" could be interpreted, as I do not wish to burn any bridges, and I would be willing to pay pet rent for our last two months, if they would drop all the other balances.  

My wife is now terrified that they are going to make trouble for our closing on the house, and wants to just pay.  I would rather not, because they are really rude, poorly organised company, and dealing with them is a nightmare every time. Not to mention I think charging 7 months is BS since we signed at the end of November after paying a month with no lease.

 So, I believe my long-winded question is: Do they have any leg to stand on with the way the lease is worded? I can see how it could be interpreted both ways, but I believe the way I am understanding it is the right way."

"Cars stopped on marked crosswalks/sidewalks (US) When it comes to ***marked*** crosswalks is there a ""universal"" law preventing cars from stopping/parking on ***marked*** sidewalks or crosswalks while a pedestrian is walking?  
Example 1: light turns red and a car stops on a crosswalk then the crosswalk signal comes on.  
Example 2: Car stops on sidewalk on side-street waiting for traffic to slow, if a pedestrian  goes in front they will be going into oncoming traffic, or if they go behind cars turning in won't see due to block vision from the car.

"How should someone go about reporting child sexual assault/ other abuse that happened for 15+ years? I(24m) was molested by my father from ages 4-7. He would feed me weed edibles like pot brownies and stuff and molest/rape me. At one point he took my brother(8yo) and I(6yo) to a hotel room in New York and made us take pictures together doing stuff. I know he has the pictures somewhere but I dont think ill ever be able to find them. I have no/little proof and I know he would deny it. What amount of evidence is needed for a conviction? Would I need to testify/ get my brother to testify? I am in **Massachusetts** and I know that the statue of limitations is 35 years I just want advice on how everything would go down.

He also used to beat the shit out of me on a regular basis for 20 years and I have people that know/ saw it happen. My father also owns/ runs an semi-legal dispensary.

"HOA Nuisance Exempts Children Even During Quiet Hours I’m currently renting a condo building in San Francisco in a two unit building. The upstairs unit is owned by another landlord separate from mine. The two landlords are in a HOA with just the two of them.

We’ve been having noise issues with the upstairs due to their toddler either running and stomping or crying for various reasons. In the CC&amp;Rs under the nuisance clause there is a note about noise. It states the quiet hours and how loud noise is not permitted during those from things like washer/dryer, kitchen appliances, etc; however, noises coming from children under the age of 8 does not count.

Does this mean I can’t complain about the noise coming from the child? Is it allowed to make rules like this based on age of a tenant?"
"Discrimination Lawsuit? Hello, this isn't corona virus related, and I don't know if this would be considered discrimination or not but allow me to elaborate.

I am a transwoman currently in her last year of college. Over the past few months I have been doing what I needed to do in order to get my name changed. I notified the school and have been attempting to meet their criteria to change my name.

I notified my school back in Feburary about the change so that they could change the name on the commencement, however, even though they claimed the name was changed I am not on the commencement currently.

Furthermore, due to the SS office being closed I was unable to change my name in their system. I sent a copy of the legal document to my school to let them know about the name change but they refused to change it until I got my social security card updated.

Finally, due to the virus we are doing an online commencement. I was not notified by email about this and only managed to find out due to a friend who sent me the website for the marching order. I tried to sign up on that website, but I was told that my account does not have a graduation. I tried emailing graduation at the school but they have not answered my emails.

I am at a loss for what to do currently. I've already had troubles with the school in the past due to their handling of trans related issues. But I am honestly beyond pissed at this current string of events."
"Someone In a Different State (Georgia) Stole My (Connecticut) Bank Info, Made a Fraudulent Purchase, and is Calling Me Spoofing My Bank’s Number I live in Connecticut and today a charge popped up on my bank account for a restaurant purchase in Georgia using my debit card. I called my bank to dispute the charge, cancel the card, and order a new one. I called the restaurant and confirmed the purchase was made there, had them save the receipt, and they are seeing if the person (who got takeout) was on their video. I also filed a police report with the local department in Georgia. 

Earlier today BEFORE the charge popped up, I missed four close together calls from my bank. I called my bank and they had no idea why I would have missed calls from them and didn’t have a record of calling. I made a very large purchase yesterday so we all assumed maybe it had something to do with that and wrote it off. After the charge appeared I called my bank again. I mentioned the missed calls from earlier and they said it might be someone spoofing their number trying to phish information. They said 99% of the time they won’t call me unless I request a call from them. I just missed another call from “my bank” a few minutes ago.

Is there anything else I need to do right now to help protect myself from further losses and pursue legal recourse? I’m not looking for reimbursement, just want to keep this person from stealing from me or anyone else again. Hopefully also find out how they got my account info.

I’m interested in picking up the call and possibly recording it, however I think it’s illegal in CT to record a phone call without the consent of the other person. Would there be an exception to that if the other person is committing a crime? Is there a way to do it legally? Am I being even more stupid than I already think to consider answering this call?"

&amp;#x200B;

I had been talking to my attorney with some regularity, but he has suddenly become impossible to reach. Last time we spoke was March 30th, and I have been attempting to reach him since April 11th. While I understand offices are closed due to COVID, I do have his personal number and we have used that number to call or text since I first inquired about his services. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, court has been pushed back once again until late June. At that point, I will have two months of probation and about $170 left to pay. My lawyer was paid $1,250 for his services and I have decided to just serve the full term, until August. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, the retainer I paid to my lawyer does not say it is non-refundable, and my lawyer did not say the money was non-refundable either. Is there a way to terminate the services of this lawyer, and get a partial return on my retainer, minus what he feels is due for the papers filed? I am a little lost because I am also unable to contact him.

"Do Venmo payments need to be reported to the IRS so a friend of mine is someone who makes tiktoks he is located in Tennessee 

At one point he put “send me a dollar and change my life” in his bio, with his Venmo

He expected a couple dollars but has gotten enough to buy a new van and start renovating it.

None of the individual payments have been over $100, but all together it’s quite a lot.

What are the rules with this. He just realized he may have to figure out tax information with this. He hadn’t even considered that.

Because he didn’t get more than $100 from any one person is he okay?
Or does he need to figure out how much to pay in taxes.

If so, where does he even begin?

"[IL] Can I collect unemployment if I'm told I can resign instead of being fired and I resign? My employer has given me the option to resign instead of being terminated, as they don't believe I was performing one part of my job at an acceptable speed. Because I'm technically in a public sector job, it still has to go to the Board to be approved, so I'm on paid administrative leave until late this month. I have gone through the appeals process and was not successful.

When speaking with HR, I was told that since it's a crappy time to be looking for the job,  I could instead resign effective June 30th, and they would honor that. My big question is - would this stop me from collecting unemployment? I have done some looking but I cannot find anything on it for Illinois. When I mentioned that concern to HR, they said that they would not contest unemployment, but that hardly matters if it doesn't get to that point because I resigned instead of being terminated. Please help. If you can give me a reference to look at that also answers this question, I'd feel much more comfortable."

"Spectrum opened an account without my permission I received a bill today from spectrum for full-fledged services (TV and internet) for an account opened in my name supposedly since May 1st. Only problem? Never signed up for a goddamn account. I had called them in mid-April to inquire about promotional offers, but that was it. Had to give my name, address and phone number for the representative to pull up the promotional info, and that was it. No social security number, no email and most definitely no signing of anything. So imagine my surprise when I get two boxes of equipment two weeks later. Called them and I was told to send them back (“probably a mistake”) which I do. Today I receive the bill. Call them back and what do you know? My name, address and phone on the account but not my SSN or email address. Whoever’s email that was, apparently it was used to accept terms and conditions. But then, why send the equipment to my place? 

The representative confirmed that they canceled the account and directed me to fill out the spectrum id theft packet ... which included filling out a police report and notarizing forms. 

I completed a identity theft to the FTC. But not sure what to do next. Fill out a police report, freeze my credit? Or is this simply a mix up? I’m not sure if I’m overreacting or under-reacting.  Anyone has had this happen to them?"

"Roommate stole and now owes me several months worth of my rent money and isn't returning messages. What can I do? hello all, hopefully you can help me out here because I am at a loss.

One year ago I moved into an apartment in Chicago, IL with 2 other people. The rent was $1,600 per month and we split it up so that myself and one roommate, we'll call him James, would each pay $500 and the roommate who got the master bedroom, we'll call him Tony, was on the hook for the remaining $600. At first, Tony was in charge of mailing in the rent check, so James and I would paypal him our share and then he would send the check. April rent got sent and everything was fine. May came along and James and I sent Tony our money and assumed the he was getting it to the landlords. Turns out he used our money to fund some cocaine and his girlfriend's abortion. Then Tony loses his job and/or just blows his paycheck before saving enough for rent or enough to pay me and James back. So we are late for May. The whole time James and I are working and saving up and having our share of the rent on time. June passes and then July comes around and Tony STILL has not come up with any money. Landlords call and I explain the situation and decide, ""Fine, I'll just pay everything we owe the landlords and Tony's just gonna have to be in debt to me so we don't end up getting evicted."" Long story short, Tony never gets his act together, the three of us get evicted, and when all is said and done, Tony owes me $1,800, owes James $600, and even ends up owing MY PARENTS $500. The eviction was in January 2020 and now, 4 months later, it appears Tony is dodging my messages and calls and I just want to put an end to this and try to get my money back. What can I do here? The money was technically stolen right?

TL;DR I had no choice but to cover my roommate's rent after he robbed me and now he won't pay me back.

"Curious if legal action can help with loud neighbors. We (wife, 1yr old daughter and myself) live in a small and very old apartment complex. Very thin walls, single pane windows and all that great stuff you dont look for in an apartment you can afford. hehe. Everyone lives on the second floor accept for one apartment and the rest is parking underneath. 

We have brand new neighbors (Male and female couple) it started out with them blasting their mariachi music as they Remotely warmed up their truck (v8 loud aftermarket exhaust) from the comfort of their apartment. That woke up our 1yr old and my wife who then wakes me up everytime. I asked the female to please turn it down when they pull in and out as it wakes us up everytime. She quickly apologized and the music stopped. Now with the music gone we are woken up by the truck rattling our windows and vibrating the floor as they let it completely warm up and it will shut its self off when it has. They treat that as their que to leave. It's about 10minuts in total of letting the truck run with no one in it. This morning it happened again. This has been happening about 2 weeks now. I walked onto my balcony and wait for them to come down. I asked them both if they would please warm the truck up outside the complex on the street or maybe only let it run for a 2-3min max and leave. The female apologized instantly again and the male (in Spanish) asked her what I had said. She told him and as he backed out he revved his engine a couple times as a ""fuck you"" when they left. I've heard it's illegal and a nice fine to leave your car running and unattended in California? I'm very good at reading people and have a solid background in wrestling so confrontation isn't an issue for me. Getting myself in trouble with a wife a kid for hurting this guy and the retaliation is what occupies my mind if I go knocking. I need help. All my  neighbors are awesome and they have all noticed this guy but shy from confrontation. Am I just being a big baby or this justified to take the steps to get it to stop?"
"Can a mechanic work on my car without my permission? FL I just had to get my car towed yesterday because it was making whining noises whenever I tried to accelerate. 

The guy who towed my car told me that the place AAA has him towing it to has been closed for the last week and a half because of the coronavirus (I found out later that’s not true) and that he should let me take it to his shop instead so he can give me an answer the next day. I said okay and he gave me his card. 

He called me and told me today that the power steering pump and the AC compressor is messed up which would make for the whining noises (I’m pretty sure that’s wrong and wouldn’t mess with my acceleration. My AC works completely fine). I asked him how much it would cost. He said the other guy was working on the pump right now to see if they could fix it without having to order parts, i again asked how much it’d be and he said he’d call at 2 with the price. 

At 4, after no call, I called him and all he said was it was definitely the power steering and the AC compressor would be there tomorrow. I again, asked how much it would cost. He said he’d get the price for me and call me right back in two minutes. 

At 4:15 I called, and it went straight to voicemail. 5:30 I called and it went straight to voicemail. Each time I call it goes straight to voicemail and the voicemail is full so I can’t even leave a message. 

I don’t want to be stuck paying for something I never asked to be fixed. I just wanted an answer so I could find the cheapest place to have it fixed. 

Am I legally required to pay for anything I never authorized? Can he keep my car? Is it legal that he lied about the other shop being closed to trick me into having my car towed there? Is it legal he’s having an AC compressor changed on it when my AC has been working fine??"
"Reduced Pay Without Notice Arizona.  I receive a salary, plus commission on sales. Per my written employment agreement, I receive a specific percentage of sales.  For the past two years, this has included additional fees charged to the customer that are separate, from primary sale price charged to the customer. With the pandemic the company has been cutting costs which is understandable. But now, without notice, they are not counting the additional fees charged to the customer as part of the total sales. So for the past month, my commission was reduced 22%.  Is this legal? The inclusion of additional fees charged as a percentage of total sales was an oral agreement from my prior boss who is no longer with the company. The new boss says this is not per the employment agreement. Don't they have to provide notice of reduced pay?"
"My downstairs neighbor is about to ""sue"" us and have us evicted because we won't stop smoking and it could kill him. We don't smoke. Landlord says it's a 'he said- she said' and is blindly believing neighbor. [CA] Hello all, thanks in advance.  This is a situation that has been going on a few months.  We've lived here for about 15 years, our downstairs neighbor moved in a few months ago, and since then we've been receiving ""three day notice to perform covenant or quit"" notices on our door with the instruction to stop smoking in our unit, it's making the guy downstairs have asthma problems.

We have not smoked once. 

Not once. No incense, no candles, not even smoke from cooking.  But apparently, downstairs neighbor has called and complained to the landlord (but never talked to us) that we keep smoking and it's coming in through his bathroom fan. (which would be directly below ours, so he assumes that we are smoking in the bathroom to hide it and that air and smoke now travel downward).  And the landlord keeps believing, never comes over to check (no one else can see or smell smoke!), and keeps telling us that ""He's going to sue us and you"" and ""he had to get a second inhaler"" and ""his doctor says he could have a heart attack"".  And so we keep getting notices and very unfriendly calls from our landlord to 'stop smoking!!' And all we can say is 'we're not!!"".  The management company that owns the building/employs our landlord says that it's a ""he said- she said"", so, i guess they're just siding with the person who is a bigger pain in their butt, which is definitely other neighbor. 
Now we have been offered another unit in the same complex, which i think is crap because 

a) isn't a 'he said-she said' a situation where there wouldn't be other witnesses or evidence besides the two parties? In this case, our 'smoking' would be totally verifiable. Couldn't you just come up and smell or ask anyone in the equally close apt. units if they've ever smelled anything?

b) I have to pass a bunch of cameras and the landlord's apt to get to the street to smoke (which i do, out on the street, at the opposite end of the property, as I am allowed). When I said t the landlord ""don't you see me going outside all the time, even at like 3am?"" and she snapped, ""yeah, I see you all the time!!"".  She didn't seem to understand the logic that if I was doing that all the time, there would be no reason for me to also smoke in the bathroom and jeopardize my housing. And how much does she think a human can smoke??

c) if they really believed we were doing anything wrong- why offer an apartment in their same complex?? Wouldn't you want to get rid of us?

Shouldn't there be something we can do without having to get lawyers involved?? I don't have money for that and I haven't done a single thing wrong!"

"[AB Canada] I ordered a legal gun that became prohibited before it shipped/they had my license. Am I due a refund? Hey Reddit, I currently live in Alberta. On April 14th I ordered a firearm from a retail location in Ontario. These firearms typically take 3-4 weeks to order, assemble, and ship. My payment was made via e-transfer on April 14. I've heard no progress reports since. 

Of course the recent gun ban on May 1st moved my gun into the prohibited class. I have a PAL and RPAL but nothing beyond the basics. 

I immediately emailed the store, wondering what would happen and assuming a refund as the product hadn't even shipped yet. I waited a few days and called, left voicemails, and called again. Finally I reached someone over the phone who told me they were still navigating the issue as there are many, many more people in similar positions to myself. 

Today, May 7th, the store called me to ask for my PAL number. Apparently the number on the order was incorrect. I indicated that because the firearm was now prohibited, they couldn't sell it to me and I should be refunded. The rep on the phone told me that technically I had already been sold the weapon and they were just returning my weapon to my possession. They can't refund it, because that would involve another transfer of ownership which is now illegal because the weapon is now prohib. 

I took that answer on the phone, but thinking on it further I believe that the firearm wasn't actually sold to me until today; they didn't have my correct PAL number and therefore couldn't have legally transferred ownership until now. 

Is my thinking legitimate? Do I have any kind of case here to push them refunding me, or am I SOL and stuck with a newly prohibited device?"

"Boss cheating me from wages. I’m a therapist in North Carolina. Recently my boss instituted a policy that if we aren’t actively engaged in a billable activity, for instance if a client no-shows their appointment, we are to clock out for that hour. I can’t actually leave work—I have to stay because I will still have other clients to see later in the day. (To be clear, she isn’t preventing me from leaving, but an hour is not enough time to leave and come back.) Effectively, that time is just lost to me and I either take a short paycheck or I lose vacation time. This is causing me to not reach 40 hours a week despite being at work for 40 hours. Is this policy legal? Do I have any recourse? Thank you!"
"Is it worth my time to pursue a civil case against my landlord? I'm reposting to shorten my original post and for clarity.

I am close to the end of my lease on a basement rental property in Virginia with two other college students. Over the course of the lease, my landlord has been reluctant to/just didn't fix problems with our heater/AC, plumbing, the deadbolt on the front door, and vermin. She has admitted to entering our apartment without notice or our knowledge. The apartment is not currently compliant with the city rental code and hasn't been since 2014. She has also been sending emails to other tenants with bcc's without consent and refuses to stop. She never gave us a list of damages in the apartment or did a walkthrough when we moved in. Now that one of my roommates and I have moved out of the due to COVID-19 she is refusing to do a virtual walkthrough of the apartment but says we will still be responsible for any damages.

"Father wants to kick me out. I don't mind leaving, but I'm a minor. Illinois, I'm 17.

My father is on the fence about kicking me out and selling the house, and I don't care whether he does or doesn't because he's not a safe person to live with anyway. However, he has my learner's permit for driving, SS info, and birth certificate, and I can't ask that he give me them because he'll blow up. I need documents like these if I want to get a job or a license, but if I try to go get replacements without him with me, I'm going to get questioned and reported to the police because I shouldn't legally be away from home.

I'm 18 this year so bringing this to court for emancipation would be too long and costly for the amount of time I have left. I tried getting out with DCFS and the police earlier, and it didn't work at all- just landed me at home with bills and an angrier father. There is literally no legal route for me to go about this, and I don't want to get the law involved.

If I do end up getting kicked out, is there a way for me to retrieve the documents that I need without bringing the law into it?

"Employer lied about wages, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada My boss bought the company from my previous boss, and when he took over I was earning $16.50/hr, after a couple of months, discussions were had and all sides had agreed that under the original owner, I was promised that I would earn $20/hr.

New Boss / Owner, decides it's time, and says, ""Hey, congrats, you're earning $20/hr""  
My new pay (which is direct deposited into my account) is bigger, I'm happier, everything is swell.

Jump to 1.5 years later, Boss decides that it would be a good idea for me to go on EI, to save the company some money because of COVID-19, but not to worry, because I'll be rehired when work comes back, and in order to do so he releases my ROE (Record of Employment).

On that document it shows my hours correctly, but it undervalues my earnings and says that I was paid for Vacation hours that I neither took, nor were paid out for.

At this time, our small company uses a 3rd party company for payroll, and as employees we are ok not receiving paystubs, because, basically it's a mom and pop shop, without the mom.  So small, it should be just a pop shop, and we trust each other, 'cause it's a small team, never really worried about pay stubs before.

However, Boss decides, now he's not going to re-hire me, and he's going to hire someone for cheaper.  
So I decide to do some digging, and formally request my pay stubs.

The pay stubs show that Boss was not paying me $20 but instead $18.50 and instead of banking my vacation pay, was paying it out to me in my cheques to artificially inflate them to $20/hr.  


What should I do?"
"My husband’s current employer asked him for his future company’s name &amp; HR number My husband works at a small engineering firm and just put in his 2 weeks. He accepted a job offer at a large company in another state. He is not on bad terms with anyone and he is well liked. This office manager in particular loves to stir up petty, unnecessary drama (examples: 1) when he put in his two weeks, she immediately texted EVERYONE in the office and alerted them of him leaving.  2) when COVID all started, his firm is considered essential so the owner gave people the option to work from home or stay in the office. This office manager flew out of the state to stay with family for a whole month, no one hardly heard from her. When the owner had her come in, she all of the sudden makes a mass email and tells everyone to come back into work immediately and we no longer need to social distance...???) 

So she asked my husband for his future employers name and HR #. She pressured him into giving it to her, and now he feels bad about it and is unsure of what will happen. 

Any advice for this situation?

"Roommate did not pay her share of electricity bill for 8 months. On each of our leases, which we all have separate leases for the rooms of the house we were renting, it says ""tenant is responsible for electricity"" . When I set up the electric bill, I told the person on the phone that 3 people lived here and told them their full names when they asked and that they are separate adults also contributing to the bill but I guess somehow their names never got added to the electric account. I was paying my share, but when asking them to pay their share they would ignore me, tell me to leave them alone,or tell me they'll do it soon or are working on it but never do it. I had 2 months left on the lease but moved out due to this roomate throwing away all my groceries as soon as I purchased food for the month and put it in the fridge and also cutting up cords for my laptop so I wasn't able to work from home or do my online schooling. I had to transfer the energy bill here that has a balance of $600. I have tried contacting her asking her to pay her half, she gotten her stimulus check, works full time and gotten a raise, and I told her I'll even pay half of her half for her but she won't. She won't respond to me, leaving the messages on read. I asked a friend to ask her about it she says she can't pay the bill because she's too stressed to think about it. Soon here at my new place my electricity will be shut off if I don't pay the $600 balance. What do I do?"
"[Chicago Illinois] My Employer Can Claim Ownership of Side Business Hi legal advice, longtime listener first-time caller.


   I work as a web developer for a company that has many clients in many industries. I have an idea for a small business (web-based business) that I would like to work on, outside of work hours, using my own resources. When I joined the company, I signed a contract that essentially says: anything the I create that is **related** to my employer's or clients' business(es) will be owned by my employer. The wording of this portion is pretty vague and makes it seem like they would own anything that I make that has to do with software. I don't want to quit my job for some business idea that will probably go nowhere, but I don't want to lose ownership if I attain even a little success.


1. If I start a business on my own time can my company legally take it from me? 

2. At what point in developing a business/product can they legally claim ownership of it? To clarify, if I bought the domain name while employed, quit the company then registered my business. Could they still claim it?

3. Assuming my side business somehow makes some money how would they even find it? 

4. Is there some kind of ""release"", ""waiver"", or ""amendment"" (I have no idea what the terminology would be) I could ask them to sign to allow me to work on it without worry? 

5. Should I consult a lawyer to review my employment contract to see if my concern is even valid, and if so how do I find one? Do I just call the Illinois Bar Association and ask for a contract lawyer or IP lawyer?"
"My work offered me my job back until they learned I was getting unemployment? I’m not sure what to make of this.. my former job that I worked for before getting laid off due to COVID-19 as a receptionist JUST offered me to take on a few hours while they begin to reopen. They asked me a few questions and after asking if I was getting unemployment benefits they rescinded the offer. Does anyone have an explanation as to why that happened? I’m not going crazy looking for work right now (thankfully).. but I’m just confused as to why after learning that they don’t want me anymore? 

If it means anything they are a small business. Not sure if this has to do with meeting some sort of requirement for a business loan?"
"Half-assed Landlord &amp; Property Managment (San Jose, CA) 

Background: I've had a lot of issues with my landlord and the property management company over the past few years I've lived there. My heater has been broken for two years that required a new heater to be put in. They never got me a new one. Additionally, I had called my landlord on multiple occasions a few months ago (who is ALWAYS putting off tasks, claiming he would come around and never does) about the leaking kitchen sink.  He said he would come with a new faucet and never did. I placed a bucket underneath the sink, but I think the cabinet underneath has some water damage. Am I liable for the water damage?

I'm moving out. I had messaged that I wanted to mail the company office my unit keys, and they said okay. I later asked if a signature at the time of delivery would be okay, and they said no. I don't want to meet my half-assed landlord because he would keep me waiting all day (if he even shows up). My key would probably be mailed to them fine, but I don't want to be liable if it's not. This may not be a legal issue, but I'm not sure what to do here. Also the lease is over at the end of this month, and I've already moved out (the first to move out of my roommates).  In the initial email the management company sent out, they said I can request an initial inspection before the final one. The company denied me of it, saying that my other roommates must be moved out before an inspection is done. Are they legally allowed to do this?

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Am I liable for any water damage caused by a leaking kitchen sink that the landlord never fixed? Can a management company deny me of an initial move-out inspection? Can they also deny me from mailing my keys to them with a signature request?"

"Domestic abuse. First of all, I would like to thank all of u for taking the time to help me, I don't know if this the right subreddit, but I just want to reach as many people as possible to find a solution

I don't know what to do, I'm 21 and I live at home with my mother who frequently gets beaten by my stepfather. I feel like a horrible person for 'allowing' this.

I got into so many verbal and physical arguments already but it won't stop. I have been trying to seek help for so long, but the cops won't do anything, even though I have plenty of photo and video evidence, because they claim that he doesn't have anything on his criminal record. 

The thing is, me and my mother are financially dependent of him, we don't have any family we can rely on so moving out isn't really a plan.
I have tried seeking help already from financial organisations (I'm from Belgium, so in my case it's OCMW) but they won't help me.

I just want to know how I can get out of this situation, my mom doesn't want to live anymore, and I feel like a failure that I can't do anything.

I really want to move out with my mother and I want to live in a small appartment with her, but she refuses to move out because she wants to keep forgiving him and give him more chances.

I recently graduated high school so my plan is to financially support me and my mother after my graduation of university so we can move out of this hellish household, even though she doesn't want to, I would have the time to convince her, the problem with that is, that it will last at least another 4 years before I graduate university, and my mother definitely won't survive 4 more years of this hell. She's telling me frequently how that she doesn't want to live anymore and only doesn't give up because of me.
My father is also trying to sabotage my school,because he knows that when I finish it, that it's game over for him and that we wont need him anymore.


If there are some people from Belgium, or some people who know a lot about this, is there any other financial aid that I can contact? Also what steps should I take to at least lessen the burden that my mother is carrying.

Thanks

Maybe some noteworthy extra information:
-We have a loan for the appartment we are living in now so we can't just move out immediately 
- my mother can't work fulltime because she has a neural disease, so her nervous system is shutting down slowly, she also has a hernia.
- I have tried combining studying and work, I could maintain this in high school but I won't be able to in university"
"Pulled over for DUI (CT). At station I blew a 0.079 and a 0.081, do I have to get my license suspended? As title suggests, I was pulled over for DUI and had to complete a breath test after failing a field sobriety test. The results came out with one being under the limit, and one being over. The officer told me that the state will suspend my license for 90 days due to my one result being over the limit. Is this true? I believe since one is under and the other is over that they shouldn’t because the results are unclear. Your advice would be appreciated"

Officer also gave me a summons for not carrying my physical license (I forgot my wallet), even though I showed him a picture of my license on my phone.

"Garage Door repair getting charged two service fees [TX] Ok, this is happening to a coworker of mine and I’m reposting this with her permission.

My coworker (we’ll call her Anna) was having a problem with her garage door and called her insurance to send a repairman out at the cost of $75. The repairman stated the repair would not be covered by insurance, but that it would cost $X. Prior to beginning work they asked “This is the total cost, all associated fees are included?” And the repairman said yes. 

After the work was completed they paid the repairman. Then they receive a bill for $75 from the insurance company. Anna and her husband told insurance the repairman said everything was included, so the money should come from him. The repairman said that his bill only included his service fees, not anything from insurance. The insurance company claimed she should’ve called them prior to having the work done.

Any time they’ve had to deal with insurance and service people previously, the insurance fee has always been included in the repairman’s bill. Anna and her husband are frustrated and feel they were misled by the repairman because he said all fees were included. Do they have a leg to stand on to contest the fee or do they have to pay insurance separately?"

"[CO] Can I be sued by beneficiaries of an estate for signing over PR to someone not up to the task? **Background**: Three years ago my father passed and I was assigned to be personal representative (PR - I guess similar to executor?). A few months later, his wife (stepmother) also passed away. Stepmother had no assets, and they had no children together.

The estate consists largely of a single, unoccupied commercial property valued at around 200k and some vehicles valued at around 15k total. There are no liens or debts.

Stepmother's daughter demanded to liquidate the assets and receive $150k they are ""entitled"" of father's estate since it would have passed to the stepmother upon his death. Brother wants to start a business in the commercial property and at one point was even ready to go into business together with stepmother's daughter.

After several rounds of legal negotiations over about a year to try and evenly split the estate between father's children (2+me) and stepmother's daughter by signing over partial ownership of the building, I washed my hands of the whole thing and handed over PR responsibilities to my brother. 2 years later, the estate is still pending.

**Question**: Beyond the risk of the estate slowly getting eaten away by taxes on the properties, what are my legal risks? Can stepmother's children or ""the estate"" sue me because I signed over PR to my brother knowing it would likely sit in limbo and never get resolved?"

They’re charging a late fee and saying I have to pay this ticket immediately when I was never even originally notified of the ticket itself. What the hell do I do? I don’t want to pay this late fee but I’m sure if I call the collection company they’ll just uphold it and claim they sent me the ticket."
"Do I have any right to rent relief under these circumstances? Hello all, I am currently renting an apartment in California. 3 days ago, my idiot neighbor somehow let her apartment get flooded. We live in two-story apartments and the entire bottom floor of her apartment was covered in about 4-5” of water. She is a whole separate issue. She didn’t tell anyone for what is most likely hours and by the time I was notified, water had begun leaking into my apartment through our shared wall.

Long story short, the property management is working on getting things taken care of but told me it’s going to be at least 3-4 days before it’s back to normal, so the next 3-4+ days, these are my living conditions:

-I have no carpet/tile downstairs. It’s all concrete.

-My downstairs bathroom is completely gone (Toilet, Sink, cabinet fixtures, etc.)

-Laundry room is gone. Won’t be able to do any laundry whatsoever. 

-Big dehumidifier that has to run during this time to dry out the walls. It is somewhat noisy but not unbearable. 

-The real kicker is the walls. They had to cut two feet high out of the walls around the entire downstairs, including the shared wall with my neighbor. This now leaves an opening between our two apartments. I could crawl into their apartment if I wanted to. It’s not small openings. Basically now I have 0 privacy in the downstairs area. I live in a very hot town and now I’m pretty sure if I tried to run my AC, I would be cooling mine and their apartment. It’s gotten very hot at night and the though of no AC has me a little concerned. The last part to this is I have a dog that could easily get into her apartment if he wanted to. I’m not allowed to block the wall because it needs to dry. 

All in all, I understand I could have it much worse than I do, but it’s still pretty frustrating and there really isn’t a concrete timetable as to when it will be complete. Do I have a case to withhold/discount rent during these days I’m affected? They already made it clear it was “livable” and that I won’t be getting a room during this time. 

Any advise? If I’m being a big baby, just tell me. I can handle it."
"Apartment neighbor messing with water heater Hey y’all I’m not sure if this belongs here but I need some advice. I recently moved in to an apartment complex. It’s a cheap and dingy apartment (I’m a college student) and my neighbors are constantly on drugs. Recently they’ve had the shared water heater looked at by the landlord. My roommate and I learned that they have access to our shared water heater and valves. They turned off the hot water valve and are refusing to turn it back on. We’ve asked them several times and they say they’ll do it then either just not do it or turn it on then back off after a few minutes. We believe that they’ve been messing with the valves every time we shower as it loses pressure and goes ice cold. We have told our landlord, but he just says to ask them to turn it back on. I’m severely anemic and if I get too cold I get extremely sick- hence why I’m not up for just taking cold showers. This isn’t the first time my health and wellness has been put at risk since I’ve moved in. I’m located in New Mexico (USA)."

"Wrong size of Oil Filter Wars .... Okay so this is my very very first post here ... and it's a doozy.

I took my car to Oil Changers in Kingston, Ontario on April 16th, 2020 to get an oil change. They showed me the dip stick (which was full) so I thanked them all and drove away. Did a few errands on the way home and all seemed normal ......

... until 7 hours later.

&amp;#x200B;

I started my car and noticed that the oil light came on. That had never happened before in the 4 years I've owned the vehicle.  I drove a total of 10 kilometers to the gas station and along the way, the car was making noises. As I was turning in to the gas station, the car almost stalled out. Parked it and tried to start it, wouldn't turn over. A few more times, same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I called my boss who met me at the gas station to let me know that ALL of my oil had come out and that there was NO OIL FILTER. So he drove me home and low and behold, the filter was directly on the ground in an EXXON VALDEZ of oil in my parking spot. Took pictures of the whole thing, and tried to put the filter in upon returning, but it came off the car again and all the newly bought oil washed aground yet again.  Upon inspection of the oil filter, the seal had not be oiled at all, it was bone dry, the wrong size.

Started to hear noises recently and had inquired to my mechanic about it today being May 7th, 2020. Upon inspection, because of the lack of oil in the car, the engine has been damaged. I can't drive on major highways because of possible engine explosion should the RPM'S exceed a certain point. 

I need my car for work as I'm a delivery driver. I met with Oil Changers today and said I was starting a procedure with head office. My car is a 2009 Toyota Yaris.

"Is He Stealing or Is He Revolutionizing Car Buying? My mother’s ex-husband tricked me into co-signing on a car when I was 18-19 years old. Under the impression it was a birthday gift for my mother, I was happy to do him this favor, and was told it would, “help me build credit for the real world”. Young and very naive about how credit works, I signed. My mom later refused the car, her current husband at the time was offended (rightly so), and in anger, my moms ex-husband lashed out and threatened to ruin my credit by leaving it in the desert somewhere. He then took back an Altima I bought from him in cash (no payments, I wasn’t ready), leaving me with the ultimatum of either taking on this $420+ monthly car payment (plus $150 for full coverage) or having a repo on my credit for 7 years. I, a college student at the time, freshly moved out and on my own, stepped up and took on the car payments. It instantly doubled my bills, but I managed. Its been five years and the car is now nearly paid off. I only owe $2700 on it! I’ve replaced the engine, transmission, and done all maintenance on it. By my understanding it’s my car. However, this morning I got an email from my moms ex-husband telling me he’d be coming to pick it up. No warning, and not a threat, a promise. 

Can he do this?! It’s my car. Isn’t that stealing? I know we co-signed on it, but I’ve been making payments on it and have put thousands of dollars of maintenance into it. 

I’m also starting school again in July. I’ve been working furiously to pay the car off before I no longer have an income, and could do it now if I needed to but it would drain my savings. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I’m scared, way too ignorant in legal matters, and the last time I asked police for advice they said there was nothing they could do. If anyone could point me in the right direction or even tell me what to do, I can handle the rest. I’m a smart woman, but I’ve been manipulated by the people closest to me all my life, I thought maybe asking strangers for advice would be worth a shot.

Thank you all in advance.

"(Indiana) “Lessing Specialist” trying to cheat us out of the specific unit we signed for My roommate and I signed a lease for a very specific unit of an apartment building back in November of 2019. The lease is for August 1 2020 through July 31 2021. We signed our lease for the specific unit because our friend lived in that unit this past year and we are familiar with that unit and the quirks and problems that come with it. Our lease specifically states on it that we signed for that exact unit. Today we received an email from the new “leasing specialist” who says that his predecessor double booked the apartment, and he’s asking us to take a different unit instead.This unit is on the ground floor, and because of the way this apartment building is built this means that it is actually halfway underground so the windows are up by the ceiling. This unit is also next to the laundry room which (per our friend that lives there now) floods more often than is reasonable, so clearly we don’t want that unit and would prefer the unit we signed for. I am fairly sure that if we signed our lease before the other people, that they can’t make us leave and we have a right to that unit because we signed first. Do we have any leg to stand on if the other people signed first? Any advice would be appreciated."
"Just discovered my manipulative father's 3yr+ affair; Mum just put his name on the deed Hello all,

Sorry if this is a little long-winded, but I will try to compress everything and only convey the necessary facts. My parents just ended a 3 week long argument over cheating allegations and suspicions my mother has held for some time. She, in the past, received numerous phone calls from several people hinting that he was leading a double life, but she has always chosen to stay. He is emotionally manipulative and has been for as long as I remember. Even now, he keeps bringing up ""fond memories"" of her father, who passed away in June, and all of the things he ""used to"" buy for her, and how they ""used to"" fly business class anywhere. I keep using ""used to"" because for the past 12 years he has done absolutely nothing financially, or otherwise, for our family. A couple of weeks ago, my mum became very cold to my dad, and any time they would talk, it would end in shoutings, denials, and his threatening to leave the country. My mum forgave him two days ago and sent us a text along the lines of ""marriage is hard, please don't be mean to your father."" And my sister and I were just done. Even if the cheating allegations were simply allegations, she had PLENTY to be angry with him for. Over the past few years, we have moved three times, with the last move being to a different state. He had not been there for any of these moves, and everything fell on my sister's shoulders while I was away at college. During that time, my grandfather fell quite ill (Parkinson's) , as did my grandmother (Dementia), so my mum had to make several trips abroad to take care of them, usually accompanied by my sister. All this time, my father was ""working"" in a different country (I put working in quotations because nothing, financially or otherwise, has ever come from this work). My grandfather passed away in June, and despite my mother being heavily upset with my father for not being around/there to offer comfort, she happily jumped back into his arms after he did the bare minimum of helping organize the funeral. All seemed to be going well until the end of April, when this fight happened and was seemingly over. Even after it ended, my father's behavior did not change. He'd order my mum around, make her get him food, despite being literally inches away from the kitchen, and just treating her as the house help. Well, my sister and I were not satisfied with the resolution, because where there there's smoke, there's fire. My sister was able to get into his Whatsapp messages and we now have hundreds of pages of damning screenshots dating back to 2017, when I was getting moved into college, of him texting with this other woman. When I say damning, I mean it is 100% undeniable that he had/is still having (as of March 1 2020, after which he deleted messages) an affair. It was so disgusting. We went through all of the screenshots, highlighted dates and everything. He texted the other woman on all of my parents' anniversary, even the 20th anniversary that he forgot. In 2017, when I was shopping for my dorm, he texted her pictures of us and the things we bought and promised to buy her the same things, even bigger and better. He texted her pictures and videos of the new house my mum built, and she replied with how she wanted to ""visit and meet us."" He texted her during the time my grandfather was ill and my mum had to take time off work to travel abroad to take care of him. He texted her pictures of my sister's graduation and she asked him to congratulate us. My mum, we believe, knew something may have happened, but is completely unaware of to what extent. We plan to present all of the evidence to her tomorrow after she comes back from work. This is where it gets messy and I would like some legal advice. The day after my parents' blow up and the fight ended, my mum put my father's name on the deed to our house as a guarantor. He had brought up during their fight of how he felt like he ""didn't belong"" and that his name wasn't even on the deed (emotional manipulation at it's finest). And I am so angry with her for giving in and doing this, then having the audacity to be angry with us for not forgiving him as well. She has $451k in her 401K, in addition to other stocks and assets, and she also recently bought him a Rolex. He does not work or live in this country, and is just a frequent resident, but his citizenship is to another country. For every financial aid form I've filled out, we only report her income as she has pretty much been a single parent. They were also not married in this country, but my mum is a citizen here and lives/works here. In the case that she decides to divorce, what can be done to ensure this leech does not claim half of her possessions? He has contributed 0% to this house my mum built, our schooling, and anything else of the matter. I'm sure I've left out a lot of important information, so feel free to ask what you need, but any advice at all would be highly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: We are honestly so concerned. We believe this is emotional manipulation of the highest level, and we are quite worried she may decide to stay, and it's just going to take a toll on her. Yesterday, she had to go to the emergency room for high blood pressure and what was thought to be (thankfully not, a heart attack). If she does decide to stay, we are 100% ready and willing to get whoever we need to involved and have her committed, because we truly fear for her health and safety, and she has surrounded herself with people who obviously do not. Anyone who tried to break her out of this, such as my aunt who told her to stand her ground and even secretly made calls to my dad's employees abroad to get their statements, is cut off. We know my mum saw one recent text between my dad and this other woman where he calls her ""my love"" and ""dear"", and he apparently convinced her these were jokes. My mum is not a stupid woman, or at least, I did not thin so before this whole debacle. She is an appraised doctor, but it seems like her love for this man/fear of being alone is keeping her from seeing that he's draining her, financially and emotionally. We have texts showing that heh's been sending this other woman money for as long as they've been together, and buying her lavish gifts. He even put together an entire surprise party for her birthday. I am just floored. "
"Parents want me to Nationalize So I'm a 16 year old living in Ohio, USA. My parents want me to get a dual citizenship with Belgium, as one of my parents is from there.

I really don't want to, though, because I'm an American. They said that they would force me to, though.

Is there anything I can do?"
"Landlord won't return sec. deposit. Asking for last month's utility. My landlord's son was my roommate. They aren't giving me my deposit back, but are asking me for the last month utility bill ($98). They claim the carpet was stained and needs to be replaced. The carpet was covered in stains when I moved in (July 2018). The only image I have where you can see the carpet is on Dec. 2018 where I took a picture of shoes I was selling, you can see it's a stained carpet. I moved out in April 2019.

They began renovating the house to get ready to sell as I was leaving. New countertops, new paint in the halls etc. I believe they just want me to pay for the carpet they already needed to replace before selling. But I have no proof.

Anyway, I've accepted I probably won't get the deposit back, but on principle, I do not want to pay the utility bill.

One thing to note is after about 6 months of living their my roommate moved his girlfriend in one day without asking me. We continued to split utilities 50/50.

Additionally the first 3-4 months I paid roughly 75% of the utility bill because he would be working in other states for 1-2 weeks at a time, (even though his girlfriend started coming over a lot). Then he stopped working away from home so we split 50/50, but never adjusted the price when his girlfriend moved in.

Lastly, (and I have all the messages saved) he forgot to pay the utility bill the second month I moved in. The power company shuts us off. He was away working &amp; wasn't affected all. I come home from work on a hot August day night in Florida, all my food in the fridge is now garbage. I can't get someone to come out until tomorrow. So after I throw all my food out I have to get a hotel room at 8pm. That was $100+ and very inconvenient. And then wind up fronting the full $300+ power bill to get it turned back on (which he quickly pays me back for).

Do I have a good case to not pay them the utility bill? Again, the only things I could prove would be my hotel receipt and our texts with him not shutting off the power, and probably his GF living with us.  


I'm literally so mad I don't care about the money I just don't want them to have it."
"A Question Regarding Copyright Laws Hello all, first post here, hoping for some good advice. I am an avid numismatist (coin and currency collector) and cardist (I like playing cards) who, like many, has been brewing ideas during quarantine. Many individuals make custom playing cards and sell them on Kickstarter, it’s a large part of the community. I was thinking of combining my two hobbies and making a deck with intaglios from the British monarchy for the face cards. This brings up my question though: what are the copyright laws for intaglios and vignettes from currency in the early 20th century? The specific companies in question are the American Bank Note Company, Canadian Bank Note Company, and Thomas De LaRue &amp; Company. Dates ranging from 1900-1970s. Any advice or direction is appreciated."
"Estate Question My dad passed away last year leaving a house to his 4 children. We do not get along, the funeral was messy. He left a will leaving the house to all of us, naming my brother as the executor.  My brother doesn't communicate well, if at all and I live out of state. I was recently served the will and an assent of waiver notice, but Im not sure what to do about it or what my options are and something seems off. I would feel better about it if the comication was better. Can I write something outlining that I'll sign under the condition that I get his action plan in writing before I sign? I know we can hire a 3rd party, but I just want to close this door as quickly as I can. I've checked the local courts and I don't see anything filed yet. Thank you for any advice on this matter."
"Sold a counterfeit item knowingly by a supplier. Wholesale retailer here, I supply smokeshop items including e-cigarettes to local businesses (Missouri). One of my suppliers knowingly sold me counterfeit e-cigs and passed them off as the real thing. The only way to verify the items as true is through a scratch code and registering them with the manufacturer's website. These made it into the hands of the end consumers and has caused problems with my largest customer. When I called the supplier to ask them about the counterfeit e-cigs they said they thought I knew even though it had never been mentioned prior and the online listing advertises them as the real deal. 

This has harmed my business financially and more importantly has severely hurt my reputation with my customers. Do I have legal grounds to do anything here? I have pulled all of the ecigs from my customers stores and have possesion of the fake ones.

Edit for clarification. The supplier is based out of Texas and has been selling me the counterfeit e-cigs for months before the end consumers let my customer and by extension me, know that they were fake."
"My boss is withholding social security checks from his nephew in an attempt to extort work out of him. Honolulu, HI. Workplace is a farm with housing. Nephew moved into the house anywhere from 2 to 5 years ago. He uses meth, threatens violence, and regularly smashes up the house, in which others stay.

Boss withholds SS checks until nephew performs tasks, such as helping at work or cleaning and maintenance.

Honestly, I see the nephew as a victim of the drugs and of his uncle who is using him — I want to see him get help. The boss is manipulative and lies compulsively. He's involved in other legal messes, but I want to focus on this one today.

Can the boss be prosecuted for extortion and/or withholding checks, and if so, how do I make that happen."
"Does an employer have to pay for facemasks if required? I did a search for my question, but I didn't find anything that applied to the situation below.

My friend's work is requiring all employees to wear facemasks during working hours, or be sent home without pay. My friend is fine with this, but she was informed that the company would not be supplying masks of any kind, and that the employee is required to purchase their own. Up until this point the company has been providing masks.

In my little but of non-lawyer related googling, it seems like this would be an OSHA violation.

One of the websites where I got my info: https://www.safeopedia.com/2/4824/employee-rights-what-ppe-does-my-employer-need-to-provide

My friend is going to ask her boss for more specifics, but is it legal for the company to ask her to provide her own PPE? My friend will most likely bring her own mask, due to not wanting to lose her job or catch COVID-19.

Info for context: we are in the USA, in Utah, and it is a retail job."
"Is it illegal for someone to spread a lie that you’re a rapist? As far as I’m aware she, let’s call her A, hasn’t gone to police about it. Supposedly A is just telling people that I not only raped her but two other girls.
I have only heard about this through what I can only assume is one of her friends(B). B has sent a few messages, all about how A is saying I raped her and two others. One of which I don’t even know. Other than that I have the name of B.

I’m worried about people around town believing I’m a rapist or even worse her going to the police with false allegations.

A is a ex friend of mine, we never even had sex. There was a kiss because A wanted to have sex but I didn’t want to. This ended up ruining our friendship because it was too awkward. Now over a year later A is telling people I raped her supposedly.

I’m trying to find out if I can get ahead of this and go to the police with texts I have. But I have no idea if it’s illegal to spread that kind of lie to other people. Again, as far as I know A has not made any kind of police report.

Anyone have some advice here?

"Will I be indicted for fraud if I submitted an unemployment insurance claim, and it got approved before I could cancel?  I applied for California unemployment insurance benefits, but soon after, I realized I may have filled out the application incorrectly. I have never filed for unemployment before, and I was having a hard time trying to figure it all out. I wanted to cancel the claim a.s.a.p, but I have not been able to get through to anyone at any of the EDD phone numbers (they're extremelyy busy), and all the offices are closed. Additionally, I never received my customer account number, so I have been unable to use the UI online system for further information. I read that you could just not certify the claim so they don't pay you, but unfortunately they've been automatically certifying claims for the past few weeks because of how busy the EDD has been during covid. I was hoping I would have more time to try and contact someone, but the debit card came in the mail today, and I'm worried because I've received the card, that I am now held liable. I won't be activating/using the card, but now I'm really worried about any penalties/fraud because it's impossible to contact anyone at EDD about this."
"Factory work- wages I've recently found out that if i were to take on the training for a higher position (PC, which is taking finished pallets and wrapping them), finish the training, and then am told I'm still labelled a packer, i would retain packers wage, not get the raise of a PC, but still be expected to do the PC work at random. How is this legal? And if it isn't, how would i go about correcting this when the time comes?

"Everyone at the restaurant my mom works at got a 3$ raise except for her I'm not knowledgeable in legalities so I'm not sure where to start in acquiring information and fighting against this situation, and I would really appreciate resources or anything that could point me in that direction. EDIT: I live in California, Placer County

For context, my mom is a sandwich-maker/chef at a small cafe and she was just made aware of this by her manager who I will call Mai, in confidence. The justification was that since my mother was low-income, her boss didn't want to push her income past the level that would disqualify us from social benefits however her co-workers with the same position and situation (another chef is intentionally requesting shorter hours) got raises so it doesn't add up. My mom hasn't spoken to her boss about it yet because she's afraid her poor English will make matters worse so she wants me to speak to her (I used to work there part time as a cashier).

This cafe has also done another number of other shady things such as violating health laws since some of the workers don't always wear gloves, and underpaying (they payed my mother below min wage when she started). In particular Mai actively steals money by taking orders, not putting it through the register and pocketing the cash customers give her. It's something of an open secret as my mom and the other chefs will frequently not get tickets, while Mai tells them the orders verbally and tells them to make it anyway. This has been reported several times to the boss but we suspect that because Mai is the boss's cousin she's aware of this but chooses not to do anything about it. I'm also pretty certain Mai hates my mom and verbally and physically abuses her by calling her slow, incompetent, fat etc. and punching her in the back while she's working. Mai also frequently steals things from lockers and my mom's purse such as money, lotions, makeup, gloves etc. That's also why I'm somewhat suspicious about why Mai of all people told her this information and not the boss. My mother is at the point of suing Mai and she's been playing dumb at work so she can get evidence of harassment and the orders without tickets. However, I want to know what we can do with this evidence

Again I will be the one asking the boss for more clarification so I would really like to be aware of some legal advice that may be helpful in this situation, and also what types of evidence I should look out for when speaking to her to figure out if my mom and I can sue them for this. I would be happy to supply more details if needed."
"I believe I'm about to be wrongfully terminated from a Law Enforcement Agency as a new Police Officer I graduated from the Academy and started field training with a local law enforcement agency in California, in January, 2020.

Long story short, I have witnessed first-hand that officers at this agency are intentionally using excessive force, and then lying about it on the police report.

In one incident, there was this domestic violence call that came out on the radio. I was dispatched along with several other officers. We arrived on scene and we saw the male suspect leaning against a garage. The officers next to me walked briskly towards him and then told him to turn around. I could already tell this guy had been drinking. The next thing I know, the officers grab him and bring him to the ground on his stomach with his head on the concrete. The male suspect didn't have any time to react or do anything. He was legitimately just standing there. Two officers get on top of him and one officer starts punching him in the face. I get on the ground and grab the male suspect's right arm. After some time, the officer who was punching him says to me, ""Taze him John! Taze him!""

At this point I'm thinking, ""What the hell? Taze him for what?"" Anyway, another officer who was on scene uses a drive-stun method and tases the guy on the ground. The guy starts squealing from pain.

Afterwards, one of the officers says ""Did you see him reach for my gun??"" And I'm thinking, ""Um..at no point did that happen.""

Later on, the officers are talking and one of them says to me ""Where were you John?? Why didn't you throw hands?"" (Throw hands is slang for throw punches). And the officer says to me that he gets pleasure out of fighting; he says ""it's better than cumming."" The officer that said the suspect reached for his gun says to me, ""we can write whatever we want in the report"" as he has like, this devious look on his face. At this point I'm thinking, ""so you used excessive force on a guy who wasn't fighting back, and then you lie in the report?""

I read the police report later on. It says directly that the male suspect placed a ""firm grip"" on the officer's gun handle with his right hand and ""pulled it away."" This never happened. How could it? I was holding on to his right arm the whole time.

On several occasions an officer has said to me, ""next time something happens, you BETTER throw hands John."" My response is always, ""Yes, sir.""

This is only one instance of several. Fights occur almost every other week at this city I work at. And I know that it's because these officers like to fight. they tell me they like to fight. They instigate fights. I've seen them get mad. I've seen them lose their cool. One time I heard two officers talk about a fight and one officer asked, ""So what happened?"" and the other officer responds, ""Well, he was being an asshole so..""

You might ask me why I haven't said anything to anyone. The reason is, this job is life/death. I have to seriously be aware of all the repercussions of every choice I make. If I ""whistleblow"", what happens if the officer gets mad at me? These are my coworkers, not my friends. And they have guns. I've already seen them get into fights because they got mad. Additionally, I need to maintain good relationships with them for my own safety. If I call for backup, I need them to respond. These are my reasons.

But now, I'm at a point where I'm being told that I have ""officer safety"" issues and they're going to recommend to admin that I don't continue field training, which means I would get fired. They said they would decide by next Monday after they review my case. And ""officer safety"" is notorious for law enforcement agencies when they want to articulate performance problems with the new trainee if they're trying to get rid of him. That's me. My performance has been as good as I could give. I gave 100% since day 1. They pushed me every minute of every shift, but I stayed with it. And I'm going to get punished because I refuse to bad things?

I'm not angry. The feeling I have is sadness. A deep, deep sadness.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. And my name isn't ""John""."
"NCP threatening 4 year old child - What would you do? My 4 year old daughter came home from her (NCP) dad's house last weekend and told me that her dad threatened her with a knife. She said that he does not like it when she tattletales. She told me that she was telling the truth when her half sibling (same age) ate all her food and played with the remote. Her dad called her a tattletale and said snitches get stitches. He told her that he would give her stitches if she didn't go to timeout. She then said he grabbed a knife from the kitchen and showed her how he would chop off her head (like slicing across throat). I am in shock to say the least. However, my daughter said it was okay because it was all pretending, but that her dad shows her 'stitches' a bunch of times.

For clarity, we are located in Texas, finalized our SAPCR in October, we have ""joint custody"" - however I have exclusive rights and duties. Her dad (NCP) sees her maybe 10% (one time per month).

What would you do in this situation? Stop visitation? File for Protective/Emergency Order? or, Modification? Get therapy?"
"Are custom designed weapons legal in Pennsylvania? I designed a fantasy weapon and planned to enter it in a contest. The top winner of the contest gets their design made, I wanted to make sure the weapon I designed was legal.

"My housemate is a danger to herself and others. What can I do? I live in subsidized housing in Washington state. It's basically a house, but each room is considered a separate unit. There are a few people who live here, and the rest of them are great, but for the better part of two years, I've been having trouble with one of them in particular.

See, she's schizophrenic, and when she's on her meds, she's a sweet older lady who helps clean up around the house and jokes around with the other housemates. When she's off her meds, though, she smashes/stabs holes in the walls, breaks stuff, screams obscenities and slurs at imaginary people, and threatens to kill anyone who tries to get her to calm down, no matter how gently they do it. She does this for several hours straight, sometimes even over 24, with no breaks, until, as far as I can tell, she collapses from exhaustion for a while and then wakes up to start all over again.

She's gone off her meds several times just in the past year, and she never goes back on them until she's forced to by a medical professional. She cannot live by herself, because she cannot consistently take her meds without someone with authority over her making her take them. None of us in the house can do it. By the time we realize she's off her meds, she's already threatening to kill us for even daring to speak to her.

Every time she does this, things escalate until the cops are called, and even then, most of the time, the cops give her a stern talking to and leave, only for her to start shouting and breaking things immediately afterwards. In the handful of times I've tried to press charges for threats against my life, (Usually brandishing a weapon. Hammer/knife/two-by-four/etc. She's thankfully only swung at me once and missed.) they've deemed her mentally incompetent, hospitalized her for a couple weeks, and brought her back here. She's all smiles for a month, at most, then the cycle repeats anew.

Once, she called the cops herself, saying that OJ Simpson and Hillary Clinton were in her room trying to kill her. She almost got shot by said cops when she refused to put down the hammer she was brandishing at the time. Another time, she broke a window, cut herself on the glass, and then just walked down the street to a convenience store to try to buy something. The paramedics found her by literally following the trail of blood she left.

I've tried to get her into assisted living. I know the company that runs the housing also has assisted living programs. Every time I try to talk to the housing manager, though, he says he's ""working on it"" or he's ""taking care of it."" Every time for two years. I've never gotten an explanation as to what's taking so long.

I've tried to get her evicted, because if I can't get her help at least I can protect myself and the people around me, right? I've cited the constant property damage and the constant 911 calls. Every time I do, I get ""If she's causing trouble, call the cops."" I've tried explaining the cops aren't doing anything. I've gotten no alternatives.

I have video evidence of these breakdowns. I have video proof of her threatening me and others. I have video proof of her screaming slurs at 3AM. I've sent it to the housing manager, and he, of course, said he was ""working on it."" That was *last year.* In the meantime, I'm worried she's going to end up killing herself or hurting someone else, and I'm at my wit's end. I want her to get help, but if there's no way I can do that, I at least need to prioritize my own health and safety.

tl;dr: My schizophrenic housemate is a constant danger to herself and others and neither the cops or the landlord are any help. What are my options?"
"My In Laws are Threatening to Take My Unborn Child My fiancé and I have had a lot of issues with my in laws here recently. Today, they made my fiancé go upstairs to talk to them. They whispered so that I couldn’t here it, and basically said I was destroying their family (my fiancé and I have no idea how), I was mentally unstable (again, no idea from either of us), and said that if I didn’t shape up (they wouldn’t elaborate) then I had to go, and if I kept the baby from them then they would file for grandparents rights and take the baby from both of us.

"Study abroad cancelled and students are still expected to pay $5000 Hi, so I go to a southern state school and was supposed to study abroad this summer. For the first 6 weeks of the program we would travel around Europe and the second 7 weeks we would take classes at Mansfield College in England. Due to the circumstances, the school cancelled the trip. However, despite there being no mention of a financial responsibility if the school cancelled the trip in the contracts we signed, the school is still making us pay close to $5000 for a trip they cancelled. This is due to Mansfield College as well as vendors not giving refunds or full refunds for the cancelled trip. They told us in early March that if we expected a full refund, then we should get travelers insurance, but it was only one line in the middle of a very very long email. Is it legal for them to still charge us for this? I was only studying abroad to save money because I’m out of state and get in state rate when studying abroad, but now I’m out of cheaper classes and $5000 that I was planning to save to do this same program next summer.

Edit: During the travel portion we took 6 credits worth of classes, so it wasn’t just traveling for the first 6 weeks. And what we’re not getting refunded mainly is the housing from the college in England, not the vendors from the travel portion"
"Landlord broken health and safety violations for months, am I capable of breaking lease early to move without consequence to myself? I've been living in this place since December (with two other people), and the lease with this landlord is supposed to technically expire in October 2020. I'm located in the United States. Our landlord is the kind of person who always sends someone else to supposedly do the jobs that need to be done around the house, and then shrugs and acts like it's beyond his control when the repairman doesn't show up, which is how repairs go for months being unfixed.

The health concerns have been mice, black mold (in the house and possibly the walls), heating, and the washer/dryer among other many repairs. Our landlord never got around to fixing these before quarantine, and now he's using quarantine as an excuse to push them off further. The only benefit to this is because since he's in violation of the lease (and we have multiple documentation about how these issues have been addressed for months and nothing has been completed) we don't have to pay rent so long as these repairs aren't being made, and during quarantine that's the only perk of living here now.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I got an opportunity to possibly move to another state with a friend and share an apartment with them in a much nicer area. My only concern is would this have any consequences for me, or would I be in the clear since my landlord has already violated the lease and I can deem the house is no longer safe for my health?"
"Used a half expired drivers license with new employer. CA 
I’m in California, and I lost my drivers license. My employer needed a picture of the front AND back of my DL. I had a picture on file of the FRONT of my current license but not the back so I took a picture of the BACK of my expired license.

This was for I-9 as well as needing a valid drivers license to enter the facility.

There’s no expiration date on the back so I was hoping the back doesn’t change from one to the other. There is a barcode that may come up as expired if they scan but I still have a valid license (somewhere) as well as in the dmv or whatever system. 

Will this be an issue? And why do they need the back?"

"Step son's (4M) mom gave up rights to her eldest child. Can was use this legally in our own court case? Hello! I'm very new to reddit sorry in advance. For reference I (26F) BF (26M) step son will be SS, his mother (28F) referred to as M and her oldest daughter will be J (9F).

My boyfriend has an adorable 4 year old son. He's been the primary caregiver since he broke up with his ex 3.5 years ago. They never got the courts involved but she's always been fine with BF having him.

Obviously I'm biased, but M's a selfish person. In the 2 years I have been with BF she has constantly changed when and how she is picking up her son, often giving us less then 24 hours notice of the changes and even failing to pick up her kid entirely. We already had plans to get a lawyer involved, I may have put my foot down saying I wanted things ironed out before marriage and BF agreed especially since the mom moved about 3 hours away several months ago so is seeing her son even less then she originally did.

M has 3 children with different men with SS being her youngest and J the oldest. Recently I was contacted by J's other parents on FB. They wanted to make sure that their daughter could still have contact with her brother since about a month ago M gave up her legal rights as her mother. We were shocked as this hadn't even been mentioned to us, we agreed that of course they would be able to see each other but asked for more information since this came out of left field.

I won't go into too specific details since we're talking about a Minor but basically J didn't want to live with her mother since M was forcing her to be a babysitter for both SS and her other child. When J lost our kid SS one day M punished her severely for it. We don't know how long our kid was lost or the type of punishment given and were never told of this incident. Not long after this J's dad got an attorney to fight for a change in custody agreement and at that time M gave up her rights as J's mom.

We had already planned on going forward legally but due to Covid-19 have had to postpone our plans for monetary reasons. Now though we're wondering if we should use this in our case against her, or if this would be good grounds to ask for full custody of SS instead of just officially having primary custody of him, or if this is just further complicating an already pretty straight forward case. We're just worried since not only do we not have a court order for him, but we also are having to rely on testimony from people we don't know well.

I should note we had contacted a lawyer before for a consultation who said that we already had a strong case and that the courts wouldn't make us change our current arrangement but would just make it legally binding/involve child support payments. This was after she had moved but before all this new information came out. We will eventually get our lawyer back involved but want to work on our case as much as we can before we have to pay him."

"Negligent use of a deadly weapon (New Mexico) I had a guy a few properties over call the police about hearing gunshots on my property. No one has ever complained before and don't shoot here often. We live in county on 5 acres, there's 15 acres between this guy and my property. We also have a nasty ongoing disputes with this guy over a dirt road that passes through both properties. 
 
Well the police came and threatened to charge my 13 year old son who was target shooting, with negligent use of a firearm. But not because of the guy that called. There is a little cabin at the end of my driveway that is a summer cabin. We have full permission from the owners to shoot when they are not home. There's also another abandoned cabin. Both are about 130-140 yards away from my property. 

The law in New Mexico says:

1) discharging a firearm into any building or vehicle or so as to knowingly endanger a person or his property;

(2) carrying a firearm while under the influence of an intoxicant or narcotic;

(3) endangering the safety of another by handling or using a firearm or other deadly weapon in a negligent manner; or

(4) discharging a firearm within one hundred fifty yards of a dwelling or building, not including abandoned or vacated buildings on public lands during hunting seasons, without the permission of the owner or lessees thereof.

I think we are fine, with having permission from one cabin owner and the other cabin being vacant? I'm having trouble figuring that out for sure though."
"Is it legal to have a security camera in my back and front yard that records video and audio in Chicago, Illinois?

"Landlord may be lieing I’m in Illinois and my landlord/ex-landlord May be lieing about having a lawyer or what his lawyer has been telling him. Around April 11th he gave me and my girlfriend, both on lease, a 30-day notice to vacate due to him selling the house. It was put in that the house and property were to be in condition with a lease from 2016 when my girlfriend at the time was a minor and I was living elsewhere. He then wanted us to take care of getting rid of past tenants property out of the garage, as we were doing this May 2nd there was a dispute of a person being on the property regardless of any proof of paperwork for a No Trespassing order on said person. He told us that day, May 2nd that we needed to take what we wanted to take and he would be changing locks on the house and said that his lawyer said he could do this regardless of the COVID pandemic, however this also would violate the 30-day notice as we would not have any access to the house. 

Can he take us to court for any rent or charge any cleanup after this situation?"
"Signing Two Conflicts of Interest I have an employer who when I started employment I signed a conflict of interest - pretty straight forward. We have a contract with a customer who has now also asked that those on the project team to sign a Conflict of Interest policy - this sounds very conflict-y to me. I am communicating with my boss about this, but having never come across this myself is this normal or are their legal pitfalls to worry about when dealing with a Conflict of Interest policy that is being practiced while in scope of a first conflict of interest?

Bot has asked that I include - I am in Florida, customer is in California."
"My foreign ex-husband continually cyber-harasses me. Is there any way to make him stop? I (30F) am being harassed by my ex husband (35M) through email. He is doing this through a web form on my website. I'm a recently laid off designer and use my website as a portfolio, and the form is used to get job interviews/freelance offers from viewers. With my lack of employment, it's an essential element to my website.

He first started this in March, she sent an email under a misspelling of  my best friend's name,  saying, ""Fuck you."" I couldn't prove for sure it was him, so I added an IP logger to the form. The next month, he sent me another email under another friend's name calling me shit, but the IP  matched where he lives. (He is Korean and lives in the exact district  of Seoul that the IP was located. I quit my English teaching job and left the country to escape him).

This month, he became more aggressive and wrote, ""You don't want to piss me off,"" in Korean under the same name from April.

I am Canadian, but am fearful at some point he could show up here to further harass me. He has physically abused me in the past, and turned my family against me during the divorce by falsely claiming that I cheated on him the entire time we were married. I can put nothing past him. Whether he does this or not, this contact is unwelcome, and is putting me even more on edge. I haven't contacted him at all outside of mailing a court summons to him when I filed for divorce here, and that was four years ago!

"My dad is the possible victim of a con man. TL;DR: my dad lent money and a car to someone who keeps promising to give him money but never follows through. Need advice. Hey so I’m not sure if this is the place for something like this and if not could you please direct me to a sub where this would be better suited? Anyway I’ll start with a little background: several months ago my dad met this guy who’s supposedly a millionaire from Florida. Now my dad is a super friendly Christian guy so he believes in helping people out regardless of circumstances. Anyway this guy was divorced and was in Minnesota for a reason I can’t quite remember, but long story short he ended up staying at our house once. My dad and this friend continued talking and my dads lent him money over time for various reasons. The guy constantly promises to pay my dad back “on Monday” or “next week” or “soon” but never does. Recently this guy borrowed a car from my dads business because he needed it to go somewhere. My dad being the generous person he is also lent him a kwik trip (midwestern gas station chain) card for his trip. Upon looking up the transactions they come from all sorts of strange places with no real correlation; Iowa, northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, basically all over up here. This guy told my dad he’d be bringing us the car on May 1st then May 3rd and now it’s changed once again to sometime next week. My dad spoke with some friends and is meeting with a sheriff about all this as we speak. Everyone we’ve talked to suspect that this guy is a conman and we even checked him out online and found several alternate names he’s used. Since nothings been put specifically in writing and all the promises to give my dad money are verbal we’re not sure what to do. Is there anything my family might be able to do about this? Since my dad gave this stuff willingly it seems to me that we’d have a hard time proving anything but I figured I’d ask reddit. So any advice?"
"Help! I'm name twins with a criminal.   

Just as the title states, I have a problem.  I'll try to keep this as short as possible. This all started a couple of years ago.  I received a letter in the mail stating I had a court appearance for a DUI. After many attempts and being flat out told I was lying, I finally cleared my name and my record of this charge. A few years later I am coming home from an overseas trip and once arriving back in the US, I was stopped by several agents that wanted to ask me some questions. After this second incident, I started to do some research. Through my research I found a person in another state that not only has the same **first**, **middle**, and **last** name as myself but also the exact same birthday. **Day**. **Month**. &amp;. **Year**. 

Since this discovery this person has caused me to miss out on job opportunities, continued questioning anytime I return to the country, banned from using Airbnb, and their address is on my credit report. (I’ve looked through my credit report and haven’t found any fraudulent activity) This person does not live in my state (Oklahoma) but they have a DUI charge here.  To continue the drama just now I received a rejected unemployment letter with his social and one with mine. I haven't filed for unemployment. I've went to my local investigation bureau to no avail. I don't know what else to do. 

How do I untie this person from myself and my address?

TLDR: Person with same name and birthday with lengthy criminal record is disrupting my life."

"Employer provided Anthem plan screwed me over leading me to get fired - what kind of attorneys do I reach out to? Encinitas, California.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

&amp;#x200B;

Employer, SmallCo, provided a HDHP Anthem plan. Anthem made my life a living hell and affected my job performance, leading me to get fired.

&amp;#x200B;

SmallCo was informed of the issues as soon as issues with Anthem began and SmallCo got me in touch with their broker's ""consumer advocate"" who did nothing except making me sign a few forms saying I would not sue them (broker) but enter into an arbitration.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I HAD to call Anthem, doctors and labs during business hours (that's the only time they were open) it affected my job performance.

&amp;#x200B;

After I was fired for poor performance, I still, to this date, have to settle bills and collections from doctors and labs as I look for a job and Anthem is not cooperating at all. No returned calls or emails.

&amp;#x200B;

HR at SmallCo says they won't do anything and recommended I sue Anthem, wishing me good luck and indirectly telling me to never call them again.

&amp;#x200B;

*What kind of attorneys do I reach out to to help me with this? I had to go to the hospital twice already due to severe sleep deprivation attacks*

&amp;#x200B;

**Details**:

&amp;#x200B;

Employer, SmallCo, provided a HDHP Anthem plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Being HDHP I have to pay the first $5k out of my own pocket. Since my husband's sick, I met that real quick in Feb 2020 since I had to go to a dozen doctors and labs after he started to have seizures.

&amp;#x200B;

On March 2020, Anthem sent me a letter stating they would reject all of my 53 claims because they were not my primary insurance and that I had ""other"" coverage.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been with SmallCo for 5 years and Anthem is the only coverage outside a liability only auto policy that I ever had in my life. My husband cannot work and never has, so no insurance policy exists.

&amp;#x200B;

Anthem refused to tell me what that ""other"" coverage is and after 45 days of constant back and forth, emails, phone calls they agreed to reprocess my claims.

&amp;#x200B;

Only thing, they now processed my claims in a different order than the original order.

&amp;#x200B;

This required me to settle invoices with a separate set of doctors and labs and follow up on refunds from previous set of doctors and labs - pure hell and purgatory. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since we had to go to a large number of doctors and labs, this was a lot of phone calls and visits. Hundreds of calls, emails, faxes.

&amp;#x200B;

It affected my job performance - I explained this to my manager as soon as this began, who proceeded to put me on probation a week after I told him.

&amp;#x200B;

A month later I was fired for poor performance.

&amp;#x200B;

SmallCo paid me 2 weeks of severance for my troubles with Anthem and made me sign a release form that I would not say bad things on twitter etc (previous employees had bad mouthed SmallCo).

&amp;#x200B;

However, I still have to settle bills and collections from doctors and labs as I look for a job and Anthem is not cooperating at all.

&amp;#x200B;

This is holding me back a lot from applying for jobs and interviews, specially with a sick husband to take care of."
"How to give gifts ethically? I run a business selling snack boxes.

A director of a medical device company reached out as they wanted to buy 100 to give as gifts to healthcare staff.

They then followed up with the concern it may be seen as bribery due to certain regulations around gifts from medical device &amp; pharmaceutical companies to hospitals.

What is a legal and ethical way to ensure that this deal goes through? Where healthcare workers get their boxes, I get my 100 box deal, and the medical device company makes their donation and PR.

"I have abusive parents I have abusive parents.

I am a 14 year old turning 15. I would like to ask for your guys’ help with something I have been struggling with for over 10 and a half years of my life. My parents ever since I was 4 and a half (when my younger brother was born). I have been not allowed to eat anything. I have been told I do not matter and a bunch of false names. My dad has beaten me up in my sleep. My dad has been smart enough to beat me hard enough to leave me crying but not enough to leave any bruises. Whenever they yell at me they take away my phone so I can’t record anything. All my clothes do not fit me at all. I do have belongings but they only get me them to make me look like I come from a good family.  My dad drinks 10 cans of beer every night. On my birthday weekend last year he drank 3 cases worth of 15 in 2 days. My brother is treated like a king he gets way more way better things than me. I got grounded for a month once just because he broke my finger. My parents refused to check the broken finger. My dad used to go to work in North Dakota and would be gone for a month at a time and come back for 9 days where he’d spend it all with my brother.  I get yelled at for turning a light on, showing emotion of any kind, teaching my brother things for school etc. I am allowed on extra curricular activities because they don’t want me around. My little brother gets $50 a week for doing one chore(picking up dog poop) that I end up having to do for him anyway while I get $20 a week just starting last September and I do every single chore around the house. I have to keep all doors open at all times. I have never once heard words of encouragement from my dad. I recently tried going to church in November and I’ve been going ever since but I get yelled at all the time for it and even made fun of for being Christian by my parents. I have been not allowed to go to school as punishment many times once for an entire week just because I told people about them. When I tell people about them they end up confronting my parents and my parents go on to try to be like the perfect family and they believe them then once we get home I get beaten and yelled at and told to stop telling lies. Ever since quarantine started I have pretty much been ignored and treated like scum. 2 weeks before quarantine started in Las Vegas, Nevada (where I live) I went to a friend’s house after school and called Child Protective Services. They then proceeded to come the following Friday to investigate the house. They were of course told beforehand so they sat my brother and I down and had a whole plan of what was going to happen. The agent first walked in and talked to my parents for well over an hour and had a bunch of laughs. They checked the fridge and cupboards for food and of course they were there they weren’t going to let my little brother starve. They told the agent that the reason I was doing CBD was because I had asked for marijuana so they gave me that instead trying to be responsible parents and they believed that. They then talked to my brother for 45 minutes. Once they were done with him they talked to me with my door wide open and they were standing by the door so my parents could hear everything I said so I toned it down so they wouldn’t hear what I was saying. After 15 minutes in all that seemed to do it for her and she then just left my room and talked to my parents for another half an hour where I later found out that she had told them that the file is closed and they did nothing wrong and I need to go to therapy and get medications afterwards. After the CPS agent left my mom just told me to get the hell out of her house and not to come back until Monday night. Ever since quarantine started they let me eat one meal a day provided I make it myself. I am constantly ignored now though and I can’t ask for any help. I just really want to get away from them not even them changing would make me better because I’d still have the memories of everything they did to me. I wanted to move in with my aunt and uncle that live in California. My grandparents when quarantines over my parents are literally going to be coming over everyday. I’ve tried looking into emancipation but I need a stable job and no job hires 14 and 15 year olds. I just feel really trapped and I don’t know what to do. I just don’t want to be at this house with these people anymore."
"NC Apartment– I want to terminate my lease before moving in? Hi, I'm stupid. I'm in the process of moving into a one-bed in N.C. and I'm shopping around apartment complexes. There is one building that is at the top of my list, but I have not viewed it yet. I visit #2 choice and it's...cute. Amenities are okay. Location is top tier, but I'm not super satisfied with the price and what I'm getting. What do I go and do? Get swindled into signing a lease. I ask the agent can I have a few days to look it over and she bullies me into submitting it now. ""What's the hold up?"" Me: ""I'm looking at other places..."" Her: ""Well, you asked if I could lower the price and I did."" While that's true... I still am not comfortable even hours after leaving the leasing office with the amount that I have to pay. The base is great, it's the added fees (!!!!!!). Can I afford this rent? Absolutely. But I want to be comfortable and super excited to be throwing $20,000 down the drain :) Please advise.

Edit: I have not seen anything in the lease agreement about early terminations. 

tldr: I stupidly signed a lease and I'm supposed to move in a month and I don't want to anymore. What can I do?"
"Employer failed to file my W-2 and did not accurately keep track of my wages/taxes Working for this small business employer has been a nightmare. I had to fight to receive my last couple months of pay that they owed. Their financial records are poorly kept and they haven't accurately kept track of the amount of money they paid me. I personally had to inform them the amount of money they owed me and there were times when they thought they paid me ""according to their records"" when they actually didn't. 

In February, I requested a copy of my W-2 from this employer (located in NJ). It turns out they did not file one for me because they thought I was paid under $500, which is the minimum requirement for filing a W-2, but I was actually paid around ~$750. They did not want to mess with the W-2 paperwork so they offered to reimburse me the difference of taxes that I paid and what was reported. I was okay with this so I agreed to it. I have all of this in writing. It's now May and I haven't received anything from them. The owner is ignoring my texts, calls, and emails. What are my options? Should I report them to the NJ DOL or the IRS?

Edit: If I do go the DOL and IRS route, should I mention the tax difference reimbursement? I'm not sure how legal this is. My understanding is that not all of my tax deductions actually went to the government and my employer kept the difference."

"My friend's abuser keeps harrasing us Okay, so my friend's abuser had been in jail for a year or so I believe. He punched her in the face at a mall infront of people and he was arrested there and he was finally put to jail, even got a restriction order that he should not talk to her. Well, somehow he got out this week. He's been trying to contact everyone who knows her and even trying to get information about her because he ""loves her"" is ""changed"" and just wants to know how she is. He's got people calling her mom and family constantly calling them names and harrasing their social media. They have filed a report to the Fresno PD, however I was told by my friend today that no matter how much proof we have that he's constantly trying to get to her they said they don't want to deal with this case and sent it to the Redwood PD. The Redwood PD has said that they don't have enough to arrest him. We literally have all screenshots of all the conversations he's having with people trying to get to her. I'm her most trusted friend, he's even tried to get me to give him her number and he's tried getting my bfs friend who knew her as well to ask me for information.

"My mom took all of my unemployment money to cover hospital costs. Is this legal? (Washington State)

I [17M] was in the hospital recently. The charges amount to roughly $8k, but insurance knocked it down to $2.5k. The ambulance bill is pending.

I would think that my parents would be legally responsible for this, as I am a dependent covered by their insurance. However, after I received my first unemployment payment and told my mom, she took ALL of it. This is because I am supposed to pay for my bills (and we have plenty of money, that they won’t spend on me).

I had owed my mom roughly $2k for my car, so when I received $4k from the government I wanted to pay for that and save the rest. 

Right now I am broke and all of my “Debt” is paid off (not including ambulance or therapy bills which could be covered by insurance). I want to know if there is any way I could go about getting my money back or just if this is legal.

Edit: the money was in my online checking account, which she simply moved over to hers."
"Comprising video taken without consent and now spreading EDIT: I MEANT COMPROMISING

Hello, I don’t really know where to start or what to do but here goes nothing.

I used to work at a topless/bottomless shop where it’s kind of like a topless bar but we don’t serve alcohol. We’re all of legal age. There is no filming or photography allowed of any kind for our privacy. 

Recently, I got a message saying there’s a video spreading of me and a former coworker of mine on a porn site and so we tried to get the video down as fast as possible. Unfortunately, this video was taken roughly a year ago and we don’t know who took and posted the video. 

We’ve tried to find as many sources for the video as possible but they just keep popping up from porn sites to twitter to reddit, they just keep appearing but that’s just how the internet works. The post on reddit had people actually identifying the place and just the comments were just soul crushing. I messaged the mods and reported the post but I don’t know if I can keep up with constantly having to browse and find this video. 

The person who first notified us about the video said his cousin from Mexico got it from WhatsApp and I guess it’s been circulating there for a while now. We’re from the US so it’s just distressing seeing everyone who’s posted the video is from a different location. 

Since we have no idea who filmed it and posted it, is there anything we can do? 

We’ve gathered account info on the users reuploading the video but it seems so hopeless that anything will make this situation better. 

Would contacting a lawyer be any help? 

My old employer was not the most law abiding citizen like the security cameras didn’t actually record and that we’re concerned they didn’t get proper permits for allowing us to be topless so we’re scared we might end up being the ones punished for getting help in this situation.  Maybe this post is just a projection of my frustration but I just don’t know what to do or who to seek for help. 

TLDR; Naked video post without consent and no source idk what to do"
"DirectTV Harassment I had DirectTV satellite for about a year &amp; a half &amp; found an apartment but the apartment didn't allow dish's on the building roof so I had to cancel my DirectTV services. For the first 3-4months been fighting with DirectTV to return their TV receiver. After getting a printed label, sending it back &amp; getting confirmation that DirectTV has it  I did not get any phone calls or mail from DirectTV for 9 months.   


On 5/5/20 I got an email from a collection agency stating that DirectTV put a collection out on me for $149.63 but will settle for $112.22. Being late in the day I decided to call DirectTV at 10AM the next day (5/6/20).

&amp;#x200B;

On 5/6/20 I called DirectTV to find out the reason for the collection &amp; they said it was a cancellation fee that they sent me in mail but they sent it to the wrong address after explaining to them 3x (I have emailed transcripts of the conversation) that I moved &amp; given them the new address. I explained to the DirectTV supervisor why I had my account cancelled (read paragraph 1-sentence 1) . The DirectTV supervisor apologized &amp; said DirectTV will wave the cancellation fee &amp; notify the collection agency that its been resolved. I turned on my recording device &amp; had the DirectTV supervisor repeat all that, which he did stating I owe no money to DirectTV. I called the collection agency right after talking to the DirectTV supervisor to notify them that its been resolved &amp; they should get something from DirectTV confirming that.

&amp;#x200B;

5/7/20 I called DirectTV to confirm they notified the collection agency of the resolved money &amp; they now did a 360 on me stating I owe the money &amp; that they can't wave the cancellation fee or notify the collection agency. I told the DirectTV representative  I have their supervisor on a recorded audio that it was to be taken care of but the DirectTV representative didn't care. So confused I told the DirectTV representative I will contact the collection agency about this to get their input.

I called the collection agency &amp; explained the entire DirectTV conversation I just had &amp; told the collection agency I have a DirectTV supervisor on audio recording that it was resolved &amp; to be taken care of. The collection agency told me to send them a copy of the recording &amp; they will look into the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

So that is where I am now, I know some will say pay the money it's not a lot but I know I don't owe the money &amp; paying it means I am giving in &amp; they may do this again claiming I never sent payment or they never got it. The last 2 days my stress &amp; anxiety has gotten worse. I can't sleep nor eat from this whole thing. I don't know what to do, I don't want to pay it but I can't afford a lawyer &amp; I don't know how to file a lawsuit on my own."
"Is it common for a lawyer to send a bill for services without an itemized bill? NJ, USA. I was divorced in May of 2018.

"Attorney terminology / terms for buying a house? Hi all,

My parents recently decided to enter the housing market and have found a house that they would like to purchase. It's going for $499k and they offered $495k. I don't know where they are exactly in the process, but the real estate agent's client (the one trying to sell the house) has an attorney that would like to change the terms of the offer.

They haven't been in this position before and would like clarification. Here are the terms:

1. Use a binder form instead of a contract form before the inspection
2. Inspection to be done within 10 calendar days as opposed to 10 business days (why is this important?)
3. 12 calendar days to the formal contract signing
4. 35 calendar days for the mortgage (parents have already been approved)
5. Deposit check to be made out to our attorney's firm for holding
6. Title search date to be moved up to be 10 calendar days (what is this?)
7. List price of $499k (taken care of)

"Need some advice about a rental problem. Without making it too long. I’m in Maryland. I was renting a garage apartment from a friend of a friend. Never signed a lease. Had issues with the landlady constantly coming into the apartment when I’m not home without warning. Lowering the temperature of the heating unit in the apartment, cleaning what she thought was messy(it wasn’t), over feeding the cat and things like that. Fast forward to the end of February. She decides after a year I need a lease. I don’t like the terms of the lease, trying to have me give three months notice of moving. Trying to lock me in to keep paying her even after I move. So I never signed it because an opportunity came up to move with a friend. So I wrote a letter with my intention to move by May 1st. I paid her the March rent and when April first came gave her the whole month of April. She tried to get me out two weeks prior because she apparently had a new tenant interested to move in while I was still living there. So I couldn’t move yet, new place wasn’t ready. So she lost the tenant. Feeling bad for her like I put her in a spot, I told her I’d give her partial month rent for May. She said ok because May was a bust with no tenant. She even said in a text if she had someone to move in she wouldn’t take my money. Now she never told me about the tenant but I know she had someone move in May 1st. Now she won’t stop texting me, leaving notes on my car, and today she said she is going to come to my place of work. I feel this is harassment. She’s threatening court and everything. Said the bathroom floor is ruined by the litter box even though I didn’t have it directly on the floor and that the three screws I used to hang something was a hard fix with $700.  What should I do?"
"Neighbor's plants have grown on to my fence, and they refuse to allow access for me to remove them. This is in Baltimore County Maryland.

Several years ago, I bought my home with the fence already in place.  I had a survey done at the time, and the fence is within the property lines by approximately a foot.

5-6 years ago, we got new next door neighbors.  They have done a large amount of planting and landscaping on their property, and it looks fantastic.  All of his planting is within his property line.

Last year, I noticed that a plant was growing through the gaps in my fence.  I trimmed the overages, and my neighbor was furious.  Too bad, I know I was within my rights to do so.  However, what I didn't see was that the vines had grown all over his side of my fence , and the weight of them is now damaging the fence.  I tried to discuss this with him, and he refuses to do anything about it, and has now marked the property line and set up a camera.  I have a foot wide space to work, and if I step outside of that, even by a step, he calls the police.   So I hired a landscaper to do the work, and the instant someone stepped over the line, my neighbor was right there to raise hell and called the police.

What are my rights here?  Am I going to just have to wait until these vines pull my fence down and take him to court to recoup the cost?    I'm seriously considering selling now, and I feel that this will lower the value if I have a derelict fence.

ETA-There is a garage with a greenhouse loft up against the fence where the vines have taken hold in a damaging way. Getting up on a ladder to trim is not an option.  Even standing on the roof is not possible."

"Ex wants money for her possessions that’s still in my house instead of me returning them. Legal ? Hi Guys,

So I recently broke up with someone and she has just told me that she doesn’t want her possessions that is still with me because I have used it - due to reasons such as hygiene etc. (these are footwear and cap).

Instead she wants me to transfer her money for these. Can I just return the stuff and be ok with it? Will this be a legal issue? I’m in the UK"
"Ohh boy need some help here. Best friend just called me in tears. Here’s some background....
Him and I both are recovering alcoholics. I’ve been fortunate to be in a sober house during covid, him not so much. He’s struggling. Him and his girlfriend are currently both active alcoholics. She is however far worse than he is. 
She is much younger, early twenties. And he is in his early forties. They’ve been together a while and were doing great until shelter in place followed by relapse happened. Now, he has an ex wife and an abuse charge due to his drunken shouting. Never laid a hand on her but as you and I know that doesn’t really matter. His girlfriend knows this.... here’s where the problem starts... he has been trying to get her and him off the booze. She’s violently against that idea. Last week he hid her vodka and in response she called the police and said he was beating her. 

Tonight a similar thing happened. She was upset he wouldn’t go to the liquor store for her and she called his ex wife saying he was abusing her. Then called the police. He was held at gunpoint by seven policemen. They left after realizing there wasn’t really any danger and finding the girlfriend severely intoxicated.

Now my question is.... what can I do to help him? His ex wife is thankfully on his side and willing to come get him as he’s currently crying on the front porch terrified to go inside. How can he get out of this situation? I mean legally too....he hasn’t been charged with anything (yet) but she seems likely to try to get him arrested if he leaves. I’m just worried with his record he could be quickly found guilty of something....anything really. 

I guess I’m just hoping for advice. I told him already he needs to leave the house now. He’s drunk unfortunately so can’t drive but he said he is willing to take his ex wife up on her coming to get him and letting him crash at her place tonight. They are friendly, and have a wonderful kid together. She wants the best for him. And knows he isn’t an abusive guy. 

I hope this follows the rules. I’m sorry gang I didn’t know where else to go for advise."
"falsifying warranty??? hey folks this is my first post and i’m on my phone so please don’t be too rough with me...
so i’m a mechanic specifically a diesel technician at a semi dealership in TN i started at my new employer just over 1 month ago and originally i loved the place until last week the higher ups brought in a new manager and let the old guy go since he’s taken over we’ve noticed a push to file everything under warranty which has always been handled by our manager/service writer not a big deal we’re all willing to learn anyway we’re a small shop there are 4 of us that work in it and twice this week our new manager has told me and one of the older mechanics to lie and damage a part and falsify a warranty claim none of us feel comfortable damaging a part and pretending it’s faulty it puts the whole company at risk not to mention if we actually started doing this if and when word got out we would struggle to find anywhere here because we’re in a fairly small town so to avoid any confrontation we got with the parts manager and he sent an email the first email didn’t get a reply so the senior tech here called the owners wife she’s active in the company and likes to stay privy to this type of thing this was tuesday today i was told to make a problem so i had another email sent the main office shortly after the 4 of us were brought together for a meeting where we were told we would be written up if any of use contacted the main office again and we would have to falsify these warranty claims to keep the customer happy...
so is this legal wouldn’t we be held liable if this gets out what are the bigger ramifications of us doing what we’re told in this scenario"
"Speeding Ticket Not Showing up in System I received a speeding ticket on March 19th, 2020 with my court date being May 11th 2020. I was caught on radar going 92 in a 65 in Augusta, GA or Richmond County. The sheriff who pulled me over told me I could pay it online too.

I went to the website listed on the ticket to pay it, but the site says ""no citations were found matching your input"". I called the number on the website and gave them my citation number, but they said there was no citation in their system matching my citation number or DL number.

What does this mean and what should I do?"
"Possible Elder Negligence? Hi Reddit. My grandfather recently had a heart bypass surgery. He was in the icu for about a month before being transferred to a rehabilitation hospital. Due to COVID-19, we have been unable to see him other than facetime calls. Calls from the rehabilitation hospital have been extremely brief, and not informative. Our first sign of negligence is the rehabilitation hospital removed my grandfather’s tracheostomy tube without consent. My grandfather has dementia and my grandmother is his decision maker. She and his other doctors have made it clear that she is the one who needs to give consent, not my grandfather, because he is confused and doesn’t know what he is consenting to. We were not made aware of the tube removal until two days after it was removed. The final straw for us was two days ago, my grandfather had been trying to get out of bed (which he cannot do, due to his weakness) and we were not informed. The next day he had fallen three feet from his bed. I am concerned this is negligent behaviour, as no precautions were put in place to prevent the fall from happening.

Hopefully this is enough information for you all. Let me know if there is anything else I can provide for you guys to make more sense of this. Thank you so much!"
"[US][TN]Disputing a bill with a Psychiatrist Hello, I live in the the American state of Tennessee and I've been running into an issue that I could use some legal advice on. I moved to Tennessee a couple months ago, and I needed to setup an appointment with a psychiatrist so that I could continue the psychiatric care that I have been receiving for several years.


I had an an initial visit with the doctor, where I spoke with the doctor for about half an hour. I filed with insurance but I also prepaid which they said they would only apply if insurance didn't cover things. I come back three months later in March, and this time I see the doctor for 5 minutes at the most. He asks me if I think I need therapy I say no. He asks if the medication is going well, I say yes. He writes the prescription and says to speak with the receptionist about my next appointment, everything up to now is fine.


That office visit occurred in March, and it is now obviously may. I received a bill last week saying that I got billed for the office visit but also 30 minutes of psychotherapy. I called the doctor's office to say I had not received any psychotherapy. They said that they apply that charge to every visit regardless of length and regardless of what takes place.


I called my insurance provider(I can provide this name but I don't know if that's allowed. It is a large national provider) and told them what I have written here. They told me they would call the office of the Psychiatrist and talk to the staff there and call me back next week(now). My insurance called me and told me they could not get in contact with the office, and they don't plan on doing anything else. I said that I always get through to a person quite quickly and they may have the wrong number, but they were no longer interested in the issue.

The total bill(the charge for the office visit and the therapy) was $160. Is this a matter I could possibly handle myself in small claims court or would I need to contact a lawyer? What made this additionally frustrating is the bill is due tomorrow. I was told by my insurance company last week that I should not yet pay as the charge may not be legitimate. Would paying this charge now limit my ability to take legal action?"
"I'm so confused how to contest a traffic ticket, California As far as asklegaladvice goes, this is probably the most basic of the basic, but I'm so confused.  I'm in California, I got a traffic ticket and I would like to contest it.  Reading the back of the ticket and the courthouse website, it gives you options on what to do.  

&amp;#x200B;

But, the part that's confusing me is how to contest the ticket.  It says show up at the courthouse for arraignment.  This means plead guilty/not guilty, correct?  So is there a trial right after? or do I have to go to court on another day after that?  

&amp;#x200B;

There is an option to plead by certified mail but there is not much more info beyond that statement.  There's also indication that I may have to pay the ticket first then if found not guilty I will get it back, but elsewhere it also says CA law does not require me to pay bail before going to court.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Some guidance would be appreciated."
"Can a business that closed due to Covid-19 call those days vacation days? A friend just found out that they get to go back to work on Monday because their boss got a PPE loan to pay for the time they were closed. The time he wasn't working is being taken out of his vacation days as a result. This sounds bogus, but does he have any legal recourse? If so, what are some good resources for him? We're in the state of Texas."
"Political Team Harassing My Friend? For the sake of keeping everything reasonable I’m going to make a few things very clear right now:

1. I’m posting this on behalf of a friend who has no reddit account.

2. No, I am not my friend.

3. The political team in question will not be defined since it strikes me that any political team harassing someone should have all the same laws applied equally.

4. For the love of all things sacred and not, let’s leave political agendas out of this , see number 3.  

5. My friend lives in the state of Washington if that helps clarify things at all.

OK got that outta the way.

Basically, the situation is this: My friend is very poor and on government assistance. This means he has a phone provided by the government for emergencies and basic communication. Nope this is not an iPhone, it’s a flip-phone; it can take/ make call, text, and handle voicemail, that’s pretty-much it. For some time now my friend has been getting calls from a particular political party (again not going to say which). These calls are in the form of a pre-recorded message asking my friend (or anyone who happens to answer) to support their candidate. More recently these calls have morphed into the pre-recorded question “This is (so-and-so) from (political party) aren’t you going to support (their candidate)?” Keep in mind that as far as my friend can tell, there is not opt-out or no-call option for this sort of message. These calls started out once daily, now they seem to run on a strange kind of calling schedule. For example: nothing Sunday or Monday, 3 calls Tuesday, nothing Wednesday or Thursday, 2 calls Friday. I’m not clear on whether the calls are on weekends as well. My friend has tried to block the calls but they come from a different number overtime. This strikes me as a red flag; I mean if it’s from a real political party, why keep changing numbers?.

Since I know this question will come up I’m going to address it now: Why doesn’t my friend just select the option to support this candidate? Well, my friend is vehemently opposed to this candidate, and as such refuses to support that person in any way. In my estimation, my friend has a point, they should not have to show any support for a political candidate even just to stop harassing phone calls..

So on behalf of my friend the questions are these:

1. Is this legally regarded as harassment?

2. Could this possibly be some sort of scam?

3. How would he go about stopping this nonsense?

4. Because political free speech is put on a pedestal is a political group exempt from laws regarding harassment via phone?

5.  Is anyone else having to deal with this?  I know I haven't gotten any calls like this but I don't have a government provided phone either."
"Maintenance demands entry for repairs with no notice [Florida] Today, a maintenance worker from my apartment complex came to fix a cabinet door with 0 notice. A work order for this was placed in early 2019, to which no response was given. We have had scheduled inspections twice since, at which time the damage was noted, but the most recent was on 4/21, and were told by the inspecting Property Manager that they would come the following day to make the repair. We agreed to this, but the repair never occurred. This is the most recent notice we have received, and have had no contact about it since the day of the inspection, in person. I have contacted management about this, but being after business hours, we have yet to receive a response. 

My question is twofold:

1) From my understanding of the relevant local law, “The landlord may enter the dwelling unit upon reasonable notice to the tenant and at a reasonable time for the purpose of repair of the premises. “Reasonable notice” for the purpose of repair is notice given at least 12 hours prior to the entry, and reasonable time for the purpose of repair shall be between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.” 

Am I incorrect in thinking that the notice I was provided was for a different date? I feel like that would allow notice to exist indefinitely, allowing entry at any time, but IANAL.

2) Having not heard back from them, I’m not sure what to expect. They have always been professional and amicable, and I think it was likely due to a communication error between maintenance and management, but are there any red-flag responses that mean I need to seek legal help? 

Ultimately, I’m very inexperienced at dealing with landlords beyond simply paying the rent. I am not sure, but from what information I have been able to gather, it seems like this is illegal. Am I wrong? Should I be worried? Should I be prepared to get legal help? Thanks in advance for any responses."

"[MI] Zillow listing has pictures of a family that doesn’t live there, wants pictures removed. So I am an agent, I had no part in this transaction, but someone asked me for advice so I figured I would come here.



A friend rented a property. They posted on Facebook back in 2015-ish, pictures of their family in the house— like birthday parties and stuff.



Now, the friend is looking at Zillow and they see the old pictured from when the listing was posted back in 2017 and it is their pictures from Facebook. Completed with their faces in it, nothing is blocked off. This includes a picture of the living room with her 2yo in the “pack in play” and a picture of her brother laying in bed in one of the bed rooms.



Zillow told her that there is nothing she can do to get the pictures removed. She doesn’t own the house, she is not part of the transaction whatsoever, but she wants those pictures down.



Is there anything she can do?"
"Question regarding towing company I was towed yesterday for “blocking a drive way” I parked in a really busy one way where I usually always park, the drive way I “blocked” is absolutely the smallest “drive way”  in the world (I can post a image if needed) the red paint that was on the curve was completely scratched off and there is no signs anywhere indicating of any towing that happens around there. I went on a panic yesterday not seeing my car parked there because I woke up to my car being vanished without a note anywhere saying who I should call to get my car back or where it even was, I panicked and called 911 they gave me information as to what number I should call before reporting it stolen. 
Is it within my right to chargeback this transaction with my bank?? The car is under my moms name and she used my card to pay the impound fee. Doesn’t she technically have to use her money?? And as I stated I truly feel like it was unlawful to tow my car and give me a $60 citation

"Landlord trying to evict me for rent nonpayment; covid job loss, executive order? Colorado My landlord posted a notice in my door yesterday saying I’m being evicted for non payment of rent. This really shocked me because when all this started and I lost my job we had communicated and he knew my situation and never mentioned the possibility of evicting me. I kept him informed and at one point told him I would try to pay half rent when I got my stimulus check. Well, I still haven’t gotten it (the website says I’ve been approved but it’s still processing), and I also don’t qualify for unemployment because I worked under the table at a bar.

My landlord wants full payment of rent, plus a late fee, in 10 days or I have to be out by the end of the month. Is this even legal right now in Colorado? Does this [executive order ](https://www.colorado.gov/governor/sites/default/files/inline-files/D%202020%20051%20Evictions.pdf) prevent him from evicting me? Also I really think this has to due with the fact that he found out that I work at a strip club. He used to be very nice and friendly towards me, saying we were all in this together and that they would work with tenants, but now he is rude and the letter attached to the notice was passive aggressive and accusatory, making it sound like I was lazy and asking for handouts. I was always planning on paying rent with my stimulus check, I just haven’t gotten it yet. Also they don’t need the money, the notice says they want to renovate my apartment and that’s why they want me out."

"Daughter being threatened with eviction in Florida My daughter (21) is leasing a condo through a real estate company in  Hallandale Beach FL..  She and her two roommates work in the restaurant industry and have all been laid off due to Corona Virus.  She has never missed or made a late payment.  In their time of need, I have paid the rent on the condo.  So, everything is still current.

The property management company sent her a letter telling her that she either had to renew the lease or vacate the property.  The girls wish to stay in the property, but I do not think it would be prudent for them to do this until they know their employment situation.  I have contacted the property management company to request a month-to-month (that I will guarantee payment in full).  They just informed me that the owner will not allow a month to month and that he is also going to raise the rent $50 per month.  The property management letter says that they will double the rent each month that a renewal is not signed to effectively force an eviction.  None of the girls will be able to rent another place because they are all currently unemployed.

Aside from everyone acknowledging what a complete and total tool these people are, what are our legal rights and recourse?  Can she sign the lease under duress and then break it later?  She is asking me for advice and I am not sure what to say.  

I wish that i was on social media, but i am not.  I would love to ""crush"" these people for their total lack of decency and humanity in these trying times.  HELP!!!

"Terrible neighbor Posting on behalf of a friend who doesn't use Reddit.

So my friend lives in the family-centric suburb of a large city. She has an asshole neighbor who's been a problem for over a decade. 

He calls the police on the most ridiculous things. He's called the police on children playing. He's called the police when her dog was barking. He threatened to have him put down (this was in front of my friend who was 12 years old at the time). One time, no exaggeration, he called because she was COUGHING ""too loud"". The suburb she lives in is literally \*known\* for their prompt police response and this guy has a reputation now, yet has never been fined or anything.

Now, he has called and gotten their three chickens taken away. He made a noise complaint, and because the chicken coop is 20 feet from the ""structure"" (house) and not 35 feet, they have now been told to get rid of their chickens within 30 days.

We've already discussed seeking action-- if they move the coop can they keep the chickens, etc. But what else can be done? How can we make a case for them to be able to keep the chickens? They are in California."
"Self Employed, covered by SO's health insurance I'm an engineer working solo as a private practice.  My SO's health insurance covers me.  A project opportunity just came my  way, but it would involve climbing through some potentially unsafe areas (I'm used to a little risk, but this is a more than I typically deal with).  The client's contract offers no protection/assumes no liability in this regard.  If I got into an accident while working on this project and hurt myself, would our family insurance plan cover that?   I have liability coverage, so I'm good in that regard, by the way.  Based in PA, but I will be traveling to other states for work, including FL, NY, NJ, NC, and SC. Thank you!"
"Father-in-law is being sued for an accident that happened while he drove my car [CA] Not quite two years ago, I was in the process of moving my family out of the country as I was taking a job overseas. I was already in Europe setting up our residence there, but my wife and son were still in California preparing to move. My father-in-law came to town to help her pack up our belongings, and used our (leased) car to go pick up some food. While driving, he made a u-turn and was broadsided by a woman going the opposite direction. We notified our insurance (Progressive) and he was found at fault, but was not ticketed by police at the scene and there were no injuries. Because I was in Europe at the time, I wasn't super involved with the process other than approving a shop where Progressive had the damage appraised - our car was eventually deemed a total loss, and the insurance company paid off our lease. Didn’t hear about the other driver, other than my insurance notifying me that her lawyer was requesting to know my policy’s coverage limits.

Now, just under the two-year statute of limitations since the date of the accident, my FIL has informed me he was just served lawsuit papers at his home in Texas, sent by a lawyer here in California representing the woman who was driving the other car. Claims of injury, loss of income, personal suffering, etc. No monetary amount is indicated, other than it being more than the $25,000 threshold. FIL has his own insurance, through USAA, but I’m not sure if they were notified of the original accident or not. My family and I are back in California now and still have insurance through Progressive. I have not been served papers, though my insurance did let me know that the claim the other driver originally filed was still open as of a month ago (I was calling about another matter and my agent informed me).

My question is: should I notify Progressive that my FIL has been served a lawsuit related to the accident? Or should my FIL notify USAA? Or both? And should I be expecting a lawsuit as well?

Thank you for any guidance you can offer, and happy to answer any other questions."

"Update: New neighbors moved into Habitat for Humanity house next door yesterday; today they came over to request our permission to start building a fence - TODAY. (IN) I posted a month ago about our brand new neighbors wanting our permission to put up a fence exactly between our houses. We ended up telling them that they really need to get a property survey done first since we don't know exactly where the property lines are. It was a little difficult to communicate this well since there's a language barrier, but eventually they understood and agreed to wait. Since they didn't know how to proceed and we were planning to do a property survey ourselves soon, we offered to research and get quotes and schedule surveys for both of our properties to be done at the same time.  


WELL. It's a good thing we did push for the property survey, because we discovered - after living here for almost 13 years - that there's actually a separate 10-foot wide lot BETWEEN our houses that's owned by someone else entirely. The surveyor said as far as he can tell, when Habitat bought the then-abandoned house next to us, they either declined to buy the adjacent 10-foot lot that was tied to it or somehow they weren't aware of it. In any case, that 10-foot lot then went up in a tax sale (that we were never notified of) and was bought by some guy for about $500. So now we have to go through the process of contacting this guy and seeing what he's going to ask for this inconvenient gap between our houses."

By default that's 6 days over. I would already by the time I received the letter have been turned over for legal action. There is no time to be alarmed enough to fix it, as I am sure was their intent. But instead, if they actually turned it over to legal, then I would have not had any warning whatsoever to either respond informing them of the situation OR to get it fixed.

I have someone coming to fix it tomorrow, the 8th. So by the time anything would be filed, I would have already resolved the issue.

"How to legally handle someone who actively ignores quarantine and putting others' lives at risk. Is there a way to legally handle (breaking the lease, sue for damage, everyone leaving and forcing the perpetrator to pay the rent, etc.) a roommate that actively puts others in danger of getting COVID-19? We are located in Southern California in US.

Here is a list of facts and things that has been happening:

* Living in an apartment with 3 others (so 4 total).
* One or more might be immunocompromised, and cannot risk getting COVID-19.
* All other roommates have been following the stay-at-home order, except for the perpetrator (calling him P from now on).
* When asked not to bring any guests during this quarantine, P agreed (verbally, not written).
* P brought a guest over claiming that the guest has been in quarantine for 2 weeks.
* P asked if they can go back to the guest's apartment for some reason to which we agreed, but P instead went to someone else's place to have a party/group gathering (we know this because we saw P's location on an app).
* P lied to the rest of us and told us they only went to the guest's apartment and back.
* Did not admit about this until we told P about seeing the location.
* P's family member (who P has been in contact with) is a nurse. This person has not been tested yet.

Because of this, the 3 of us (including me) want to leave this place. However, we are not in a good place in terms of money as well (we're all college students).

So we are currently wondering if there are any possible legal actions we can take to either soften up the financial damage or have it completely covered. Thanks!"
"worth pursuing w/ wedding venue or cut over $12k in losses Howdy, I was scheduled to get married this month. Due to the Pandemic my venue has been shut down. They are asking to reschedule instead of refunding. Offering back no money. However, a lot of family is overseas and re-planning with would be a complete logistical nightmare with over 150 guests. We are most likely going to go to a courthouse once they open. With that being said, we are already out of over $12k. All I am asking if it would be worth my time to get a lawyer or just cut my losses. I called around and they each wanted $2k+. We really can't lose any more money over this, so perhaps someone with experience in this area can just tell me to get a lawyer or not worth it.

"Buying undeveloped land I'm from AZ (Arizona)
Ok so this is a rather simple question. Is buying undeveloped land a one time payment? (in cash)
For those interested, my girlfriend has an idea of basically living off the land and Im looking at the financial viability. I couldn't find an exact answer regarding whether I have to keep paying for the land. Is there like some kind of land tax? 
Thanks in advance for your time and answers,"
"Tips on creating a simple will Hi, with all this Covid around, I've been thinking about writing my will in case I die! Yes! Fun! I basically have nothing to pass on, I just want to ensure that what I do have goes to a certain family member OR a bunch of animal shelters--not to any of my other shitty family members. 

I see that this can be done on LegalZoom. I also see basic templates online. What would be the best approach to creating a simple will? I'd like to do this an independently and cheaply as possible. Peace!"
"Identity theft in Fidelity retirement account, how screwed are we? (DE, USA) I have a major problem.

Someone hacked my wife's Fidelity retirement account and withdrew the entire amount (17k) to a Chime Bank. We just found out about this yesterday and contacted Fidelity.

"NYC Condominium not allowing movers in, but require Certificate of Insurance so won't let me move my furniture by myself Hello!

I currently live in a condominium building in NYC, and my lease is over May 31st. I rent from a private owner and have recently discovered that the building is not allowing any private businesses inside for the foreseeable future due to COVID-19, which means that I can't have movers come into the building. They'll allow me to take out my stuff by myself, but for large furniture (like my couch and bed) they require a Certificate of Insurance in case of damages incurred to the building during the move-out. Is there a way for me to get Certificate of Insurance for myself? 

The building management company tells me I have to take it up with the owner of the unit. I don't think it's reasonable for them to expect me to leave my furniture here and pay for rent or renew my lease. Is the building legally allowed to refuse me the use of the elevator to get my furniture out? I am willing to get insurance or do a damage deposit and move the furniture out by myself, but am wondering whether I am allowed to push for that. 

Thank you!"
"I signed an agreement, not a contract, with a roofing company. Roof got approved I want to hire a different crew to put the roof on now after learning sketchy things. Quick story short. Roofing company(RC) came to my house saying they can get me approved for a new roof through wind + hail. I gave them the go ahead for the free inspection and they found damage and said yes they could get me a new roof through insurance. Well I signed an agreement, not a contract, saying I agree to allow RC to complete all prescribed repairs at prices determined by my insurance. Insurance adjustor came out and approved the new roof. 

During this process I learned of sketchy things such as crummy roofs, promised repairs but not acting on them, etc. They now want to come over and do a Materials Contract with me and want me to give them this big insurance check. I mentioned that I might want someone else to do it after reading reviews, so he said if I dont go with them, he's owed 30% of the total estimate or the right to do the job. None of that last sentence was ever said to me or even mentioned in the agreement I signed. Are these empty threats because I want to go somewhere else for the work?

I would post a blank picture of said agreement, its only 2 very small paragraphs, but I believe its against the posting rules"
"Received someone else's car title in the mail. Hi LA, my apologies if this post is off topic or too simple for the sub. I received someone else's car title (MN, Hennepin County) sent to my address. The post office has appeared to alter the original address using pencil on the envelope to my address. I'm unsure of how I should proceed in returning it. As far as I'm aware it is illegal for me to be in possession of this document, and I don't want to accidentally shoot myself in the foot when attempting to return it (i.e. giving it to them myself and potentially handing it to the wrong person). Additionally, I'm wondering by doing this the post office may have liability if the address change was unauthorized. I've attempted to call MN driver and vehicle services but can't get in touch with anyone. Advice would be greatly appreciated!"
"Someone else's felonies appearing on my background check, affecting job opportunities (OR, GA) I've been applying for new work lately and I discovered this today. I live in GA, the records are all from OR.
  
A month or two ago I had a job offer rescinded because of information discovered in my background check. I didn't think much of it because I have an old misdemeanor on there that I was aware of, and assumed the company just had a strict policy. Sucks, but part of the price you pay. A few weeks ago, I started a new job after a background check. Check was clean. I applied for a second job yesterday, and the background check came back this morning with a bunch of felonies on it. The felonies are listed for a person with my first name, last name, and birthday, and in the same county in OR where I got my misdemeanor.  
  
The same company (Checkr) did the checks for both recent applications, and their website shows the results for both. The check for the job I was approved for came back with my old misdemeanor only, and the job I was denied came back with the felonies. The dates of the extra charges range from a few months to a few years after the date of my misdemeanor.  
  
How do I deal with this? Is this a case of lazy background checking (not using SSN, omitting the middle name in the search (middle name isn't present on the report for the extra charges))? Stolen identity?  
  
How do I get these charges removed from my record? These charges are all 4+ years old and span several years, which means the same mistake(?) has been made several times, and the only reason I even know about this is because I've changed professions. The felonies in particular are concerning, but I don't want somebody else's mistakes keeping me from getting work. I'm a caretaker and am currently very limited in when and where I can work, and the job whose offer was rescinded was particularly perfect for my circumstances, so this has been incredibly impactful.  
  
Where do I start?"
"Halting PTO Accrual We just got the blanket corporate email about changes to our compensation package related to Covid-19 losses. I find that in addition to assumed austerity measures, for salaried employees they are halting all PTO accrual for a period of June-September, which essentially amounts to 8 days of total PTO accrual. Our PTO bank covers federal holidays (for which we are forced to take PTO), sick leave, and additional PTO. Is there anything I can do? I live in colorado, working for a non profit organization."
"Wrongful Death Suit in Missouri? My younger brother (20M) crashed into a house a few months ago, instantly killing his older passenger and he himself later dying in the OR that morning. There were no other injured parties and we still don’t know what exactly caused the crash (he was driving over the speed  limit on a straight road and veered off, flipping the car into a house on the opposite side of a residential street) as the investigation is still ongoing. We suspect alcohol and or drugs involved. The passenger was over 21 and there are texts indicating that he might have bought my brother beer before the accident but nothing is confirmed. 

My brother was covered under my parents insurance company but the car was in both his and my fathers name. Insurance is covering the damage to the house and our policy is up to 100,000 per person injured. However, the deceased passenger’s parents have each retained a lawyer (they are divorced). The passenger was not living at home, and had no dependents and paid no child support. 

That being said, my parents have not yet hired a lawyer bc of the pandemic and they aren’t sure if the parents are planning to sue them for wrongful death or settle for policy limits. We have not opened an estate bc my brother lived in rental housing and my parents co-signed on all his education loans and bank accounts. The only property he had was his personal possessions and car (which is now totaled) so there really isn’t much of a point. 

My parents are really worried that the passengers family will attempt to sue them and take their house, cars, etc as they are now drowning in debt from the accident, medical bills, private loans for my deceased brother, etc. 

The facts aren’t super great for either my family or the passengers family, since my brother was possibly speeding, not fastened in, and unknown whether he was under the influence and the other kid was not really a contributing member of society and also supplied alcohol to minors. I just don’t see how it would be a wise idea to attempt a civil case when a judge/jury wouldn’t necessarily find a sympathetic plaintiff in the passenger/family. Further, the passenger died immediately at the scene so there was no pain and suffering or any medical debt incurred. 

Are my parents at risk of being sued for wrongful death? Should they hire an attorney or wait for the settlement/filing of a claim? 
Thanks in advance"
"Enforce purchase agreement to remedy code issues on a flipped house GA The summary:

I purchased a house in Georgia last September that was not up to code, but the seller and I added an amendment to the purchase agreement stating, ""For a period of one year from closing, Sellers will make needed repairs required due to renovations to the house which do not meet County code for work performed.”  We agreed to do this because the house had back taxes on it and was going to a tax sale so the seller needed to close quickly.  I had the county inspect the house after closing, and they found many issues. I had contractors estimate the cost to repair these issues, and the estimates ranged from $4,632 to $5,757.  The seller and I are now communicating through my real estate agent. I asked the seller for the higher amount to cover any overages I might incur. He countered by offering me half of that, which will only cover part of the electrical repairs and none of the plumbing, HVAC or structural repairs. 
Do I have any legal options to fully enforce the amendment to the purchase agreement and have this resolved?  Do the seller's agent, title attorney, mortgage company or any of the professional parties involved in this deal hold any responsibility?


These are the details:

The house I purchased had recently been renovated. That builder took out a private loan for the purchase and renovation from a local real estate agent and developer for the work. The builder was unable to sell the property and ended up getting foreclosed upon by the lender. I then purchased the property from the lender, who was also the real estate agent selling the property.

A few days before closing I found out through my own research that none of the building permits for the work had been closed out, and a certificate of occupancy had not been issued. I discussed this with my real estate agent, and she talked to someone with the County who said that a certificate of occupancy was not required. I still did not feel comfortable with this, and the seller offered to add an amendment to the purchase agreement stating ""For a period of one year from closing, Sellers will make needed repairs required due to renovations to the house which do not meet County code for work performed.” 

This made me feel comfortable with moving ahead with closing, based on the verbal council that it was legal to occupy and on the amendment stating that it would be remedied after closing.

I contacted the County last October after living in the house for a month and had code inspectors come out to finish the inspections. They told me that my real estate agent was incorrect; it was illegal to occupy the home without a certificate of occupancy. They found many issues with the electrical work, a few with the plumbing, one with the HVAC, and one with the structure. I tried to work with them to find a solution, but they were just as confused as I was about how to proceed since they said they weren’t going to require me to move out of my home.

After consulting with a family friend who is in construction, and my real estate agent/her broker, I had the code inspectors come back out and fail the inspections. Then I obtained two estimates for the work that would be required to bring the renovations up to code. The low end of the estimates came to $4,632 and the high end was $5,757. I sent the failed code inspections and the estimates to the sellers asking that they bring the work up to code per our contract. The sellers responded through my real estate agent that they are too busy to have their people come out.  They asked if there was a financial solution that we could come to for me to get the work done. I told them that since work often goes over the estimated cost, I would like the payment of the higher estimates because they would not be billed directly for the actual cost of the work.

Today I received a response that they are willing to give me half of what I asked for, which does not even cover the lower estimate for electrical work that is required.  I find this completely unacceptable. The code inspectors and my family friend all seem to think that the seller's agent, title attorney, mortgage company and any of the professional parties in this deal should have not allowed the deal to close."
"Can my dads boss/landlord prevent us from having guests or going to visit other people? I live on a racehorse farm that my dad also works at.

"Injury at property I'm renting 
I'm located in the metro Atlanta,GA area.

alright, so, last week I had a pretty bad fall on the deck of the house I'm renting because there was a bad board that rotted through and my foot went through, twisted and was badly injured. A week later now I'm having to see a specialist because even though urgent care told me nothing was broken my foot is still in pretty bad shape. 

So I reached out the property management company who told me to file with my renters insurance, my renters insurance told me they'd only cover injuries to others, so now I'm at a loss, I do have pretty good health insurance, but I'm still going to be looking at several bills around the care I'll need here, that I guess at this point I'm on the hook for. Is this right? or is there a way to still hold the property management company responsible for the injury I sustained due to a badly maintained deck ?"
"Can I legally sell my Ex boyfriends furniture after a year? I posted in AITA and someone suggested that I post here. This was my post: 

""First time posting here, also on mobile so sorry for formatting. 

So a little bit of back story, we broke up after a year and a half together in March 2019. I saw his phone light up before work one day, realized he was on Tinder and Grindr behind my back. I dumped him on the spot and by the time I got home from work that day he had packed up and moved out. A week later he had a new girlfriend and stopped answering my calls or texts, including ones that were asking him to come pack up his things. 

He left 90% of his clothes, his bed, dresser, desk, dining room table and chairs, and his TV. I packed up his clothes for him and told him I'd set them outside on the porch so he could pick them up. He didnt pick up his clothes for another MONTH, and he only got it because I kept texting and calling every few days. He refused to answer any of my texts about his furniture and when he did he would say ""just keep them as long as you need"" then go back to being unresponsive. 

Now my roommate and I are moving out of the apartment and it's been over a year since he left. I want to sell his furniture to buy new stuff for our condo but he JUST reached out and said he wanted his stuff back, over a year later. I tried to get it back to him for months and he flat out ignored me, but now that its convenient he wants his stuff back. It took me forever to finally get over him and I really don't want to see him or deal with him ever again, that includes inviting him back over to grab his furniture. 

AITA for wanting to say fuck him and just sell his things? ""

I do want to add I never gave him a set date to come grab his things, anything that he did come grab (his clothes, knickknacks, TV, books, etc.) he only picked up because I packed them up for him and it was weeks after I did that for him that he would finally come. He hasn't given me any compensation for storing his things and we haven't had any contact whatsoever since August 2019. That is until he asked for his things back a few weeks ago. 

I tried really hard to get him his stuff back and be fair about everything and he just fucked me over. I REALLY don't want to see him or have anything to do with him as I'm just finally starting to be okay. 

Do I legally have to give him back his things? Or can I consider them abandoned because its been so long? I live in Texas if that makes a difference."
"Received a trespassing warning for pulling into someone’s driveway Edit: Michigan USA

No flair because not sure what it fits under if you tell me I’ll edit it.  I was picking a friend up to go get Wendy’s and when we came back there were police.  Apparently their grandmother was tripping over something (we’re teenagers they live with their grandma) And then after a while they gave me trespassing warning.  I only pulled in the driveway to pick up and drop back off. 
As far as I know that just means park down the street or a couple blocks away if we hang out again but I would appreciate a second opinion.

"need to break my lease with my SO; Brooklyn NY Throwaway account for obvious reasons...

Looking for all the real estate lawyers here please!

I (m, 27) live with my girlfriend (f, 23) in Brooklyn, New York. Our relationship has been turbulent to say the least over the last few months and it looks like we are going to have to break our lease and go our separate ways.

**Our lease doesn't end until 12/31/2020. Both my name and hers is on the lease.** 

This brings me to my questions.

* Do we attempt to sublet the apartment on our own? Or do we attempt talking to the landlord about breaking our lease entirely and only moving out once he has a new tenant is ready to move in (maybe a landlord would be more receptive that)?
* If we break the lease but do only move out when a new tenant is ready to move in will this affect our credit/ ability to rent apartments on our own in the future?
* If we break the lease and move out when a new tenant is ready to move in will this affect our security deposit? Will there be early termination fees?

I'm trying to think of options where we can end the lease but the landlord doesn't lose any money on the rental unit.

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!"
"My old boss is pushing me to give him a portion of my profits (UK) I used to work as a software developer for an agency but left to start my own company. I had a restrictive covenant in my contract that forbade me from working with clients of my old company without permission (as is usual).

The company started to struggle a bit and was unable to service a particular client so I met with the client and the company and agreed to take the work. This is not in dispute.

It's 9 months later and i've significantly improved the relationship with the client and now my old boss wants to negotiate a commission. We agreed 0% commission before but only verbally (I know..). I've spoken to my old boss multiple times about how well the relationship is going and he's never asked for any money until now.

His old company went into administration late last year so that might affect my contracted relationship?

It seems to me like him not even mentioning commission until now is acceptance of terms by his actions so am I in the clear? How would we even negotiate a commission since it would have to be back dated some how???"

\-Do you drink alcohol?

\-How many months of rent can you afford up front?

\-Why did you leave your last home/apartment?

"Home ownership dispute after divorce (CA) I own a home with my parents (50%)  and my ex-husband and myself (50%). This is how it is deeded on the title. My parents paid for the down payment and my ex-h and I paid all bills on the home since 2009.

We separated in April 2017 and I have lived in the home alone and pay all of the bills without his contribution. 

Now, my Ex- husband does NOT agree with the title deed. He says he owns 50% and I own 50%—and that my parents own 0% even though the deed to the home lists them first and they are listed on the mortgage. In fact, my parents gifted 50% of the home to ex and I in 2012 and stayed on the title and mortgage purposely. 

We divorced in 2019 and the house was not divided in court because my parents’ lawyer advised them not to be joindered to the case, and do the judge couldn’t divide the property. Ex H testified in court that my parents and I agreed  he and I would own the house 100% once we repaid the down payment to my parents.  He has no documents proving this agreement and we never repaid my parents the down payment. 

What can I do? He says he’s not interested in settling for the 25% ownership the deed lists him as owning, and suggests we go to court. I feel like I’m being blackmailed into giving him the house so I can be released. I can barely afford to make payments and he won’t sell or contribute. Could adverse possession be an option? 

Thanks in advance. I tried to keep with the key details. I know this thing is a mess."
"My employer is trying to force me to sign a NDA, What can I do? I am going to keep this post as vague as I can because I am pretty worried about what I can/cannot say. 

I work in the medical field in Southwest USA. Basically in the past two weeks we've hired/contracted ALOT of people out of state to come help with research on the virus. Yesterday my boss pulled me into his office and told me that I would need to sign a NDA soon to keep my job. 

My question is, am I allowed to know what kind of risk I'm taking by signing it, what kind of information will I be withholding, etc. Also, is it even allowed to threaten someone's job if they don't sign an NDA if I wasn't told before I took the job that I would have to sign one?? I work for a pretty large company and this all seems absurd to me. I went to school for years to get were job and i don't want to lose it.

"Burden of Proof For Landlord Returning Security Deposit - Seattle, Wa Pretty simple situation - we moved out of our apartment and hadn’t received an itemized list of deductions or a check for our security deposit.  After 40 days, we sent a formal email citing the Landlord Tenant Act and requesting our full deposit back. After 4 days of us following up daily, they responded that they had cut a check a month ago. My question is do they have to prove that and how? We didn’t receive it, and we didn’t receive a letter about deductions. So I’m not saying they’re lying, but if they are - it seems pretty easy for them to cover their tracks. If I’m legally entitled to my full deposit, that’s what I want. This excuse  just seems like an easy way to cover up their incompetence."
U-haul damage issue I rented a U haul cargo van last week. When I return the car the dealer finished visual inspefection and sent me a first invoice $55 but after an hour they sent me another invoice and said they found the damage on the roof so I need to pay $800 to fix the damage. They left the car on the steeet more than an hour and then ask me to pay for the damage. They said Im the last one who rent the car so I have responsiblity.

"Is the landlord trying to scam me? I’m applying for an apartment and I have an ESA (emotional support animal) for my PTSD and severe depression.

The landlord is asking for $100 more in a deposit and $35 for the animal itself. I mentioned that it was an ESA multiple times but he said it was a commonality for all animals. Am I in the right or wrong? How do I respond?

"Could this mean I might be facing a felony? So, I just wanted to make this clear before I begin. I’m not ignorant to the crime I’ve commit so if I did get arrested for this, I understand why. I don’t want that though so I’m hoping I don’t get caught. 
My friend and I have been shoplifting from Target since November and I have reason to believe they’ve been building a case on us. It’s been well over $5,000 worth. Maybe a lot closer to $10,000 than I’d ever hoped. We had a method; I use a barcode at self check out that’s only worth .89 and pretend to scan most of the items while the friend distracts the cashier by either talking to them or they’d buy alcohol. We had moments where we felt it was a close call with certain comments directed towards us that we thought we were overthinking and we sometimes heard associates communication on the walkie-talkies throughout this entire time. Thinking back I believe it wasn’t coincidence and that it’s definitely been because they’ve been confirming and building a case against us. I know that some retail stores will let you keep getting away until they know you’ve reached an amount that could land you a felony charge. It wasn’t until recently that the comments became more aggressively direct from the associates. We were doing the normal check out thing and I noticed LP with the grey shirt standing and he clearly stated he has his eyes on me into his mic. I had made sure to purchase everything with a target card that isn’t mine but I’m allowed to use it. It’s a family member who lives in another state who wanted to help me live. As we were leaving my friend handed the cashier an item they were fidgeting with mentioning they didn’t want it and the cashier said “because $13 is really worth it at this point” and we left. My friend went in alone the other day to pick up a prescription and maybe another item and someone approached them asking if they needed help and asked “so where’s your friend today?” My friend asked “do I know you? Did we meet at a club maybe?” The associate said “no we don’t know eachother”. My friend walked to another aisle to which LP approached them asking about the bag they were holding (the prescription they had purchased in the store pharmacy) and mentioned very specifically how they’ve been having issues with people not scanning items at self check out. He also asked “where is your friend today? Is that them on the phone?” (LP noticed they had AirPods in) My friend was able to play it cool that entire time. They pay for their item at self check out to prove they didn’t steal that additional item and the sheriff stopped them and asked to see the receipt obviously and he said “good you paid, keep it that way”. Now I’m wondering with all the questions about me and all that, are they going to arrest me on sight? Or do I have to get caught stealing again to seal the deal? What’s going to happen to us? Are we just banned? If they didn’t get my friend then is it me? Or do they want to catch us both together? If there’s anyone that works at Target what does this look like with LP. What can we do to minimize the blow if it’s as bad as we’re worried for it to be? I’m in Florida btw and I am new here from California so I have nothing really tying me to anything here."
"Maryland Emancipation My wife's sister has been being abused there multiple ways by her Mother and Step father and we tried to get her out through CPS and after a meeting with the sister in question, the mother and the biolgical father(actual good person) CPS ended up making her go back to the family even though she told them everything though I'm disgusted by the result, the biological dad is filing emergency custody but we also looked up and saw that in maryland minors can be emancipated at 15, she's 16 will be 17 soon.

"My landlord has gotten complaints of strong marijuana smell on my floor (US non legal state) So, today all the apartments in the hallway my apartment door faces (not including mine) got a note on their door from our landlord/property manager that there were several complaints of a very strong smell of marijuana smoke in their hallway. They also reminded the residents that marijuana is still illegal in our state and that they would “proceed to take legal action if it does not stop”... 
Now I’m curious, exactly how much can they really do? Can a smell in a hallway be enough to get a warrant for the whole hallway or even the floor?

Addition: I live in Wisconsin and I am aware that there is a law that says the landlords must give the tenants at least 24 hour notice prior to entering their homes for any reason. But, I am not aware if the suspicion of drug possession gives them the right to just drop in."
"Workplace threatening to issue second ROE making employees ineligible for EI or CERB. This is located in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Today  I got a call from another Cabelas employee telling me that because my  middle name was misspelled this was not considered a legal transfer and  I'll have to drive back to the store with the receivers, hand them over,  get another background check then drive back (providing everything goes  well on the check which it should i have nothing weird in my past).  My  issue is, I've already built up one lower up and I'm going to lose half  a day driving just to take these back and forth, for now a 2nd time.   Should I even bother?  What could they do?  These were paid for and they  handed them over and the parts are already on one.  So if by some odd  chance things didn't go well I'm going to either have to complain to get  a parts kit or have them try and take it off and give it too me? (How  long that would take and in what condition it would be in when I get it  back is in question.)

What should I do?"
"Update: (MA) Wedding venue closed down permanently without notice and won't return deposit [Link to the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/fn0tl5/ma_wedding_venue_closed_down_permanently_without/). Some things have happened since I originally posted so I figured I would post an update.

Shortly after posting I found a lawyer through the MA bar referral site who recommended we send them a demand letter. I agreed and paid him his fee. Hours later, (this is now four days after posting here and the letter hadn't been sent yet) I got a call from someone claiming to be with the venue who said they needed my address to mail me a check for the full refund of the $10,000 we were owed. Keep in mind this was the first and only contact we've received from the venue since this all started. I was skeptical at first, but provided my address and decided to wait. The woman on the phone also told me the venue would be reopening after the COVID situation calmed down. We waited about a month without receiving anything in the mail before I started trying to get in touch with her for an update. I called several days in a row and left 3-4 voicemails without receiving a call back. Turns out the venue filed chapter 11 bankruptcy 2 days ago according to my lawyer.

Now I'm not sure if I was was lied to in some sort of stall tactic or if they were hoping to take advantage of the government assistance and that fell through or what. I'm more inclined to think this is just incompetence and poor management. It's a mess and we're pretty devastated, but are not surprised that this is the outcome. The lawyer I've been speaking with is looking into the details of it now and we'll probably file a claim as a creditor, but we are unlikely to receive any money at the end of this because their debts significantly outweigh their assets.

It's not the happy update anyone was looking for, but I will update again if anything else happens or changes."
"Accepted a new job out of state after making an offer on a home in Kentucky. Realtor advised it could get ugly if I back out now. So, we negotiated repairs and the seller agreed to them. They’ve completed the repairs but I do not want to follow through with the purchase. We close in a week and I’m worried. 

We notified our realtor and he said, ‘We would be better off following though. Things could get ugly if you try and back out now.’

Is there any way we can back out now without losing more than our ‘earnest money’?"
"Can my fiancee switch from a student visa (F-1) to a spousal visa (CR1) without any issues? Location: California, USA

My fiancee (20F) and I (20M) are planning to marry this summer. I am a native-born US Citizen and I will be beginning dental school in August in America (I started undergrad at 16). I met my fiancee a little over 3 years ago on her foreign exchange year when she was a junior in high school, and we have done distance for a little over 2.5 years. She has been attending dental school in her own country, with the idea to eventually do a specialty program to become accredited in America. However, we are both very tired of the distance, and I have applied for a scholarship opportunity that, if I am accepted, would give me the financial means to marry her and take care of my tuition and our combined living expenses. Then, I would cosign a loan for her tuition to go to dental hygiene school.

I do not know very much about immigration law, but I do know that generally speaking F-1 visas process a lot more quickly than any type of spousal or fiancee visa. This means that the goal would be for my fiancee to come via an F-1 visa and marry me, and later switch to a CR1 visa. Essentially, my question is, would this constitute visa fraud? She truly does want to attend dental hygiene school and would complete the program if she enters the country via this route, but she also does want to marry me and live with me in America. We would have no issue waiting to switch visas until the end of her education if that would make a difference.  I would like to know what the best way to handle this is.

Originally, when I was transferring from community college to university, I wanted her to come on a K-1 fiancee visa (which would process during her senior year in her home country) and marry me and do hygiene school then, but we had only been dating for about a year at that point, I had never met her parents who do not speak English, and her family had major reservations to this plan because they believed it would be costly and irresponsible due to our age and having only dated for a year. Now, I speak their language to a fair degree and may soon have the finances to avoid loans for anything other than my fiancee's tuition, and I now have completed my bachelor's degree, so I believe I can convince her family to give me their blessing to marry her as long as I end up with the scholarship. However, I do not want to have to wait an entire year longer while her K-1 visa processes, and she would have to wait another year to begin hygiene school.  So, if there is any possible way to make this work to where she begins school on a F-1 visa and marries me, then later switches to a spousal visa, that would be the ideal route, both in terms of her education and our personal happiness. I greatly appreciate any advice on the situation :)"

"[MA] Got approved and received payment from both UI and PUA I am a Personal Care Assistant who has been unable to work because the family of the individual that I care for doesn’t feel it’s safe for me to provide home care until stay at home orders are lifted. I’ve been unable to work since March 12. 
Last week I applied for regular unemployment (UI) and I was only able to request payment for two weeks prior to that, nothing for the 5/6 weeks before that. A friend said that she had applied for pandemic unemployment assistance and she received pay for every single week since she had stopped working, 8 weeks of backpay. I didn’t understand how everything worked and couldn’t get anybody on the phone so I decided to just file for PUA to see if that’s what I was supposed to have done. Within a couple days I found out that I had been approved for UI and that I had been approved for PUA. I thought this was a mistake and expected to only receive payment from one, but I received direct deposits with 3 weeks UI pay shortly followed by 6 weeks PUI pay. I’m now very confused how to proceed and which of the two I’m actually entitled to. I have bills to pay but no idea how much money I actually have and how much I should anticipate to be asked to give back. I can’t find any information on this issue or get anybody to answer my calls."
"Detaining Someone Scenario I don't think I would ever be one to get into a fight, but when I see videos of people holding someone else down until police arrive, it makes me wonder if that is legal on the part of the detainer.

"Violation for curbside garbage plus a bonus lawn question To start, we had left old, unused items on our curb for people to pick up and that's exactly what happened for most of the stuff. We also have some junk on the side of our shed (not visible unless you look over or under the fence) that's been there for a while too (we're throwing it out little by little). 2/3 days later (today) we get a violation notice to remove said stuff from the curb and quite possibly the side of the shed. Now we got 10 days to move everything and have the guy come and inspect...


First off, why can they do this? It's my property is it not? I'm responsible for my sidewalk n curb and if someone gets hurt on it, I get in trouble not the government, so why do they get a say?

Second, out of spite, I was thinking of moving the stuff on the grass closer to my house (not as close to the street). Would that be a violation too?

Third, though this doesn't exactly involve this, but what are the laws of having a fire pit on my front lawn? I live on a busy street n some nights wouldn't mind having a fire, drinking some brews n watching the cars go by.

I live in New Jersey and this is one of many things they try to control even though it's our property. Examples - fence can't be above 6ft (so we can't be totally private) or I can't renovate my shed without letting the town know n paying them, otherwise if they catch me, I'll have to tear it down, pay them n do it again. There's other things i can't think of rn but it's quite agitating. They'll probably say it's for ""safety"" but idk, it's a bit overbearing. I apologize if I  and/or my questions seem dumb (simple-minded). Thank you"

"Past roommate is suing me, do I have a chance in court? What should I do? (Bellingham, WA) I lived on the living room floor of my friends apartment complex for about five months. I never signed a lease and there is no contract or written agreement to me living there.

"[CAN-Ont] Common law and primary residence. Greetings community,

Location: Ontario Canada (LocationBot didn't understand \[CAN-Ont\] I guess\]

**Background:**

My GF moved into my house a few years ago and has been paying rent on a monthly basis (inconsistent amounts as she went back to school and paid what she could afford to).  She has now graduated and is working full-time.

**Situation:**

I've owed my house for about 10 years now and have a decent amount of equity built up in it.

**Question:**

Would us becoming common law (after 3 years if I'm correct) entitle her to a portion of the equity in the event that we were to separate?

If I were to add her to title/mortgage, is their a way for me to protect my equity while allowing her to split future payments and build joint equity moving forward?

I reached out to a lawyer near me to discuss these questions, but their hourly rate is a little steep to simply find out the basics before moving forward with any paperwork.

Thanks in advance."
"Father-In-Law cannot evict ex-girlfriend from the house he owns even though they occupy the same room and she doesn’t financially contribute. (MN) My 67 year old father in law was dating a woman in her mid 50’s. His children were concerned about financial exploitation from her but he still stayed in a relationship with her. This past Sunday, he ended the relationship after she verbally berated him about a variety of things. 

She has never paid rent, though claims she did cleaning and other things around the house. We pursued legal counsel and were told to give her a weeks notice to vacate the premises, and she in turn filed a complaint with the Attorney General’s office. The office threatened to sue my father in law if he proceeded to follow through with the vacate notice. 

Now it seems like an eviction will need to be filed, however, all evictions in Minnesota are suspended through the peacetime emergency with few exceptions. While we are concerned about his well being and her manipulation, I don’t think they are outward enough to warrant one of the exceptions. 

Is he stuck with her in his home, his own room even, until the peacetime emergency is over and he can evict her? This seems so unprecedented and the legal counsel we pursued is still unsure what options are available. It’s baffling that in this scenario, he could potentially be stuck with her living in his same room for months. 

If this matters at all, they were out of state since January, they only returned to the residence last week."

"Lease Termination ( Caliornia) I am an international student studying here in California. Since the pandemic happened, my country closed off its borders and launched a program where nationals can apply online to get flown back home. I was notified less than a week ago by my country's government that my flight will be tomorrow on 8/5/2020. I have contacted my apartment's property manager as soon as I got the news in order to terminate the lease since it ends on 5/7/2020. 

Per the lease agreement I have the following two options: 

1.  ""The first option would be to pay a settlement fee of 1 ½ times your monthly rent which is due at the time the notice is given. This amount is paid at the time the notice is given and you are responsible for the rent through the end of the 60-day notice. At that time you are no longer responsible for the lease.""

2.  ""The second option would be to give the 60-day notice to vacate and pay rent through the end of the notice. However, you will be held responsible for the rent until someone moves into the apartment.""

I was not planning on going back home nor breaking the lease however COVID-19 happened; As a result, I obviously couldn't give a 60-day notice. I am also sponsored by my country's government and as soon as I enter my country I won't be getting my stipend. I tried to reach a settlement with the property manager, however he said there is no other way around it. 

What would happen If I vacated the apartment tomorrow and failed to completely pay off the remaining two months of the lease?  Is there a solution to get this resolved without getting into legal trouble?"

"[NY/WA] Divorce and down payment credit. Living in NY for five years, married in WA.

My STBXH's lawyer sent my counsel a settlement agreement today that discusses plans for the marital residence, purchased in July 2016.

As expected, his counsel is requestion 50% equity in the home, which is reasonable. However, they are also demanding ~$60k payable to my STBXH as credit for the down payment used to purchase the marital residence, arguing that it came from the sale of separate property.

My STBXH owned property in WA before we were married. We lived in that property together until it was sold in July 2015, in advance of our move to NY. My name was never on the mortgage or title, but it was on all of the closing documentation. I had to sign all of the documentation, and the house is listed as being sold by us as husband and wife. A check was issued for the equity in the condo and was deposited into our existing joint checking account in July 2015, comingling with existing funds. 

Does my STBXH have a claim to said credit for the down payment made on the NY property?"
"Dealer sold me a structurally damaged car under the guise it being Certified. Hello all, bit of a weird situation but just looking for some advice. This took place in the state of Georgia.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago I was in the market for a new car, I found one online from the local dealership at a good deal and it was listed as Certified Pre-Owned so would come with the extended warranties. Throughout the whole transaction it was never mentioned that the car had previously been in an accident and had structural damage. I found this out from another dealership when getting it appraised. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the dealership that sold me the car and they gave me the run around saying that they couldn't do anything but treat it like a regular trade in for a new vehicle. I feel that I should have been made aware of the underlying damage and the apparent lack of CPO Warranty that was never told to me prior to purchase.

&amp;#x200B;

I paid for a car that was CPO and damage free and now it is obviously worth much less due to it being damaged prior to my ownership.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m not sure what actions to take, I have already talked with the dealership and they were not much help, I am in the process of getting in touch with the auto group that owns the dealership to see if that could help. Should I get a lawyer? Should I contact the manufacturer?

"PPP loans and Covid My employer recieved their PPP loan for a locally owned restaurant in Indianapolis during this quarantine. There are still 5 weeks left of pay we are guaranteed, but now we are opening our doors May 11th. Some employees claimed it wasn't safe to go back to work, so HR told them they could go on unpaid leave and still collect PPP checks. As an employee who is going back to work, scheduled 30 hours a week, I am told that I will still receive the PPP check as well, BUT... any hourly wage or tips earned will be subtracted from my PPP check.
Example: PPP check is $500/week. I've recieved $400 in wages and tips. So my pay is still $500... it was explained to me as a ""wash"". I'd get the $400 I earned, and the extra $100 from PPP. The other $400 of PPP money would go back to the employer.

"Non-compete advice (ad-tech) I'm working for a company that reduced salaries globally on April 1st due to COVID-19.

On top of my salary being at minimum wage (as well as my direct reports), my 10K bonus has been reduced to almost nothing.

I will probably ask the police to go after the general partner also, assuming since he didn't fire the controller that he directed the action and he benefited from it (he only owned 50% of the company that paid the bonuses, 100% of the company that owed the bonuses.)

My question is when does the criminal statute of limitations begin?  State is Pennsylvania."
"Confiscated drone help So, I unknowingly flew my drone into a Montana wildlife refuge area, and a federal game warden ticketed me without a court date and confiscated my drone, and is giving me a hard time about getting it back. I already paid the fine and it cleared with the state.Does she have the right to keep my drone?"
"Apartment with me in it Lysoled by neighbor So I've been living in my apartment complex for almost 2 years now. I am a pretty active person, and I enjoy doing bike trainer workouts in my living room. The trainer is actually very quiet and I do put on a movie or something to pass the time.

Today I opened some windows as well as cracked open my door to let air circulate while I worked out. My neighbor then started spraying Lysol front of my door which immediately drafted into my apartment. Obviously when you're breathing hard and Lysol gets into your lungs it's not the best.

At first I thought it was a coincidence but then she did it again and then knocked on my door. I picked my head out and she said, ""could you please keep your door closed since it is not 6 ft apart.""

I then slammed the door in her face and I've been fuming since.

I have half a mind to keep doing my bike workouts with my door cracked open. If she continues to spray or closes my door does this constitute anything?"
Partial unemployment during covid Hi. This does not directly affect me in any way but i am trying to help out some co workers. So we all work at a restaurant in west virginia. The servers went from making over a grand a week to $10 an hour for maybe 20 hrs a week only doing takeouts. Most if not all servers applied for partial unemployment. The owner found out and he is telling the servers and anyone else who applied for partial unemployment that they will get taken off of schedule if they continue to claim the partial unemployment. Do they have any right to do so? Do the employees not have a right to collect partial unemployment when their hours have been cut over halfway? And the difference in money is enough to financially ruin some of these people. So what else are they supposed to do if not partial unemployment. Thanx for any help.
"I want to protect my contractors from losing PUA benefits in Texas. Is there a way we can still open without jeopardizing them? Our contractors (massage therapists) make their own schedules under normal circumstances, so there is no such thing as us 'recalling' them, and we make no reports to TWC (Texas) regarding independent contractors.  

We are about to be legally allowed to reopen.  Our contractors are divided on whether or not they wish to return.  We would like to give the option and allow those who want to work to return now, but allow the others to stay on unemployment.  Texas has no job search requirements at the moment, but if we are open, and they theoretically have the option to add themselves to our schedule, does that automatically disqualify them from benefits based on ""refusing to accept a suitable job""?  We have absolutely no reason or plans to report them, as again, they are independent contractors and we have no control over when they offer us time anyway.

If they will lose benefits, we will stay closed longer to protect them all, but that stands to hurt some of them who have had trouble accessing benefits, and it's only a short term solution."
"My job will not let me return because I am still positive for COVID, however they are not furloughing and I have already used all of my pandemic sick pay. I’m now not getting paid at all. What can I do? So back on the 21st of March is when I had my first symptoms of coronavirus. I got over the worst of the illness and now I am well over a month from day one of my symptoms and still have trouble breathing and have a cough. So last week I finally got the go ahead to be tested, and I just got my test results today and they were positive. The provider I spoke to on the phone said there was really no telling when I’ll stop shedding the virus but that I have to continue to quarantine. 

The problem is is that I am now completely without income. My job gave us an allotment of two weeks of pandemic sick pay to use and then an additional borrowed pto of 100 hours that I would essentially be in debt to them and if I decide to leave the company before I’ve worked enough hours (15~ months) to come back from -100hrs to 0 hrs of PTO, I will owe them the amount of money that was given to me. Which now would total around $2300. Which is not something I have lying around. This is also a really well paying job and the schedule works perfectly so I would like to keep it. 

I’ve reached out to my local HR rep and they’ve basically told me I’m SOL. I have bills and have literally no way of paying them now. I’m also not sure what will happen with my health insurance if I’m not coming in to work. 

Is there anything I can do about this? Would I qualify for unemployment? My manager and operations manager called me the other day and told me very sternly that I was not furloughed so I could not apply for unemployment. But that I was also not allowed to come back to work. 

I have no idea what to do here! I recently moved to this area so all the savings I’d had were blown through on the move. And then I wasn’t working long enough at this job to build up more than a couple hundred of savings before I came down with COVID. 

I have no money to fall back on except the $800 in my account right now. I have absolutely no idea what to do. I’m fucked financially until I test negative. This is in Indiana.

TL;DR: I am still testing positive for COVID after a month and a half and my job will not let me return to work, but they are also not offering me any more options as far as sick leave or anything goes. I am now totally without income until I test negative for the virus, which there’s no telling when that’ll be. What can I do?"
"What are my tenants rights NYC? Hi I will be moving to an apartment in Manhattan NYC rent free in exchange for housekeeping plus I'll be getting paid. Everything has been discussed through email. 

I would like to know my rights if by chance the owner decides to blindside me and wants me out the apartment. Do I have to move out immediately or do I get 30days? I honestly don't think this will happen but I want to be prepared since nothing is being signed on paper. Thanks."
"Job abandonment and federal work screening So, someone created a similar post a few days ago, but my situation is a bit different from that post, so my situation is like this:

Currently filling out an SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions in the U.S. It's a NACI tier 1 investigation. Not a clearance. Also not an SF-85P.

In the past I quit two jobs without providing a two week notice. I've left both of those jobs because of health issues. Nothing to do with quitting before knowing I would get fired, or anything involving misconduct at work. I realize that not providing a two week notice is looked down on, plus of course burn down bridges.

My question is, would this cause an issue in obtaining a favorable NACI background check?"
"N11 Form versus 'a release form'. Is there any issue with not signing the latter, after my lease has ended? Ontario. Kind of a complicated scenario but I will try to keep it brief. 

I have moved out of a rental unit at the end of April. I signed an N11 Form, but did not perform a move out inspection with the landlord. The lease says that:

*After the Tenant gives a Notice of Termination of Tenancy to the Landlord, the Tenant shall arrange with the Landlord to complete an Outgoing Inspection Report, which shall be signed by the Landlord and the Tenant. If the Tenant fails to arrange for the completion, or to complete, the Outgoing Inspection Report with the Landlord, then the Tenant is deemed to accept the content of the Outgoing Inspection Report completed solely by the Landlord.*

No move out inspection was performed by the landlord until into May, when a new lease had begun. The scenario around why it was not performed in April with my one roommate that remained in the unit until April 30th is unclear, but I'm not too sure it matters (correct me if I'm wrong).

The landlord is now claiming that I **must** perform this move out inspection now, and sign a release form; saying if I do so they will minimize fees directed towards me. My argument is that the unit is now in a new lease, and that any damages/items in the house cannot be tied to me as my lease ended at the end of April and there is new tenants that can instead be held accountable. 

For more context, when I moved out, I emptied my room and removed all possessions (have a video of my empty room as well). One of my old roommates, who's lease terminated when mine did, is now subletting from the new tenants that took over for May and moved a few items in my vacant room. There is currently a dispute between the landlord and this roommate, that I want no part of.  However, the landlord keeps tying me back to the issue by bringing up this release form not being completed. 

My question is, do I have to sign this document now that my lease is over? Can an outgoing inspection report even be performed after my lease is up and a new one has begun? I keep trying to tell the landlord this, that I am no longer a resident, but the release form not being signed and the fees I will have to pay because of it keeps coming up. I'm wondering if my thinking is wrong, because the lease says '...t*he Tenant is deemed to accept the content of the Outgoing Inspection Report completed solely by the Landlord.'* Is this applicable, even into May?

Really stressing me out and would appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance."
"archive.org has my previous reddit accounts up. Can I use this to ask for it removed? I posted on a reddit account in 2017 when I was 16 years old, and then I deleted the account in 2018.

"Is doing burnouts in front of the same persons house harassment? Massachusetts

I flaired this as douche, because I know I’m being a jackass. But I got a call from my old neighbor, and she was upset being my other old neighbor (let’s call him Tom) was saying and doing some pretty shitty things. Back when I lived on that street, it was normal for Tom to be a shitbag. The last couple nights I did some burnouts in front of his house. And I figured out that he called the cops when I walked outside to grab something from my car and the cops were at my car. They told me that I could get charged with harassment and reckless driving (along with reading me the riot act). But it’s not like the cops saw anything. Is there actually grounds to do any of that?"
"Can my Boss ask me if I'm going to quit? Sorry for any mistakes, first time posting and I'm not sure what to make of this situation.   
Location Montana.   


I work at a locally owned hotel and have been working there nearly a year. Until this morning my roommate also worked at the hotel. This is relevant because our boss has made it known he doesn't like hiring people that are connected (married, dating, living together) he's had couple's quit at the same time.  
I work front desk, my roommate works housekeeping. We have different supervisors and make a point to operate as separate entities at work, one doesn't speak for the other, etc.  


This is relevant because this morning my roommate quit. Things have been rough for the hotel since the virus, and most of housekeeping was being called off daily. Roommate had been called off 3/4 days for 2 months. This morning he was called to work at a separate hotel owned by the boss and turned it down asking to be removed from the schedule. The owner has suggested more than once HK find other work if they don't like the hours.

(As a side note, staff overall have been stressed and frustrated. We've been brought down to a skeleton crew with everyone on the edge of overtime. One of the front desk staff put in their two weeks notice a few days ago)

It's my day off today (and the next), things went down with the roommate this morning (from what I overheard it was a civil conversation with the HK lead), this afternoon my boss called me.   
The first thing he asked was ""Why did \[Roommate\] quit?""   
He hadn't tried to call my roommate or speak with him at all today. I was stunned by the question but replied that he would have to talk to roommate about it, I hadn't spoken to him about it   
He then asked outright ""Are you going to quit""  (I'd been considering it for what I hope is obvious reasons, but hadn't brought up my thoughts to management and had intended to give two weeks notice, etc)   
I said ""I haven't put in my notice"" as a reflex, I was stunned since the start of the conversation.   
He said okay and that he needed to plan, then asked if I would work tomorrow.   
I turned it down and when he started trying to promise more hours I told him I'd speak about schedules on Saturday.   


He called my roommate 20 minutes later to ask about reasons, try to offer hours again, etc.   


My questions:  
Would it be legal to record a conversation with my boss without letting him know I am recording if I'd like a record of the conversation?   
Is it illegal for my boss to ask if I'm going to quit?   


I know there's not  much that can happen legally and a lawsuit isn't really practical, but I'm hoping to get a better idea of my rights going into that conversation Saturday  


TL:DR My Roommate quit the hotel I still work at and my boss called me to ask why he quit and if I was going to quit. What are my rights?"

"Bank theft? Hello there! 
I was talking to my 89 year old grandpa and he suspects an employee at his bank emptying his safety deposit box.  
He keeps record and notes of EVERYTHING.  He has over $32,000 in gold coins he purchased and has receipts for that he put in a safety deposit box.  There was a banker at his bank that often helped him with things like paying bills and setting up his deposit box- this guy knew what was in the box.  One day my grandpa went to talk to him and learned the guy no longer worked there.  Shortly after, he took his key to the bank and it no longer worked for his box and they told him his box had been closed.  This was a few years ago now. He didn't report it because he didn't feel he had proof to prove his suspicions of that banker.  
Anything that can and should be done at this point??

"Unfair ticket on the Blue Ridge Parkway, Virginia Last week me and my friends went on a hike and took seperate cars to socailly distance and on the way back, we were all driving in a line and a ranger passed us and turned on his lights.

I think the ranger had no idea who was going faster and just picked me bc he felt like it but I don't understand how he could record my speed when I was right behind my firend going a very similar speed, and why I only got a ticket when we were both speeding?

"Grocery store refuses to do anything after an employee tests positive for COVID-19 I'm asking this on behalf of my brother. He works as a cashier in a grocery store.

On Wednesday, he came into work to find a sealed envelope addressed to him. Inside was a [letter](https://i.imgur.com/7tx0Rfq.jpg) stating that a coworker of his has tested positive for COVID-19. These letters were only given to other employees that have worked closely with the employee in the last 48 hours. Not every employee knows about the positive case, but it's slowly getting around by word of mouth. It's been confirmed that one of the employee's family members has also tested positive. This person has not been at work since Tuesday.

Other than these letters, the store is not doing anything else. I only know of this because my brother works there. The public does not know about the infected employee. I called the store director and asked what was going to be done, whether the employees that came within contact with her needed to stay home and be tested, or if the store would be shut down to be cleaned. He said they are following the CDC guidelines, and it does not call for any of that to happen. They aren't changing their hours, still working normal times from before the lockdown. Brother says they're also not allowing any employees to call off work because of this unless they start showing symptoms. One manager even claiming that ""we're already exposed"" and ""you're young, you'll be fine."" Even though my brother received this letter yesterday, he was still scheduled to come in today

I'm not looking to sue or anything like that. I just want to know the legality of this situation. Can the grocery store really carry on like nothing happened without letting people know? What can my brother do to stay safe?"

"Accused of sex work as a side gig. I work in a professional (or so I thought) organization as a sales trainer. I got a call from my boss who is an executive and working from home that there is a rumor that I am either a prostitute or cam girl. This absolutely blew me away. At first I laughed, but now I’m second thinking the whole ordeal and have been reflecting on it. I came here as a manager who oversaw employees, so I guess I’m looking at it through that lens. 

I understand that it’s illegal to be a prostitute and that is (probably?) a termination. Would it still be a fireable offense to be a legal stripper or cam girl? I’ve looked and it’s not written into the Employee Handbook. 

Although the rumor is false, I would like to know if I can do anything about it. I personally believe that sex workers are people who deserve to be cared for. Plus, if I was, I don’t think the right immediate response is termination. 

Thanks for your thoughts!

"Hospital is charging me as ""Emergency Services"" but I went to the Urgent Care. Hi LegalAdvice

My case is not complicated at all, but it's very frustrating, and unfair. I need assistance to get in contact with somebody who can help me with legal advise to correct a hospital bill.

I went to the Urgent Care section at Hospital in Texas in regular urgent care hours. The receptionist, the nurse, and the doctor, they all assured me that my visit was an urgent care visit and not an emergency.

I recently received my bill, and I am being charged that I was in the emergency room, clearly they used a wrong code to bill me. I called the number on the back of the bill and the billing rep said that the Urgent Care is an ""extension"" of the Emergency Room, and there is no way to correct my bill because there is no an ""Urgent Care"" bill code at the hospital. This is unbelievable. Clearly on the front of the building says ""Urgent Care"". I know that the emergency room is next to the Urgent Care, but I was never moved to that location, and nurses assured me of that.

After so many calls and hours of frustration, they refused to negotiate for a discount even in this hard times and pandemic. I escalated it to different people, and they even refuse to negotiate/discount because I used insurance (note: at the time of services, I didn't met my deductible). Clearly, I'm being punished for using my insurance. I'm completely stuck in this unfair system, no urgent care billing code, and no discount because I used insurance.

I know that I have very limited options and the legal option is my last one. They cannot charge me like that and my insurance doesn't support TDI mediation, and they told me that the hospital needs to fix the billing code.

I noticed that I'm not alone in this and there are people complaining about the exact situation. There are negative google reviews about this scheme against the hospital. The hospital definitely is taking advantage of this situation.

I'm not sure if it will cost more money to contact a lawyer but at this point is important to fight this bill. I will appreciate if you can point me to the right direction.

Thank you."
"Refusal to wear PPE Hello, currently I been employed at a fast food restaurant for over a year and a half.  With this recent events I've followed the arbitrarily enforced rules but chosen to refuse to wear a mask.  I have zero contact with the guests besides food preparation.  Our work environment has us basically elbow to elbow at most times so the rule of social distancing is constantly ignored.  As well as any guests that do come into the restaurant also may not may not have ppe so they could supposedly infect us.  Besides the actual improper use of said ppe with everyone wearing their same mask for 8 hours in a workplace with no ac in the back food station so summers are miserable. 

Tired of this nonsense and believe it is against my right to be muzzled  and suffer possible heat stroke as with breathing my CO2 into my face all day.  With workplace conditions as a side note.

Located in Pennsylvania, was company owned but I believe the owner bought the store and has like 20 or so employees give or take.

So I guess my question is, any legal course I can take or just prepare to file in line to unemployment? :("

This is gonna sound ridiculous but I ordered a $0.01 pair of underwear (for my birthday) from American Eagle and when I received my package it was torn open and replaced with potatoes and plastic ball pit balls. USPS had noticed the package was damaged and put it in a plastic bag that basically said “sorry” so I feel like it could very well be someone at USPS. I’m a little upset about the underwear cause I was really looking forward to receiving it, but mostly I’m just annoyed that I can’t seem to do anything to report the theft and have the person who stole it be disciplined. Im lucky that what I ordered happened to be free but I feel like if I don’t do something, this person will just continue to steal packages. The package wasn’t insured so i can’t file a claim through USPS. Does anyone know what I can do to proceed?

"Company put wrong air filter in my car and now my engine blew *** OHIO*** So a couple months ago, I got an oil change at a pretty well known place (not going to name names) and they also replaced my air filter. Everything has been fine with my car since then until yesterday when everything was completely fine one second and then the next it made a loud noise and then smoke started coming out of the hood and oil was everywhere on the ground. My car is a 2017 Toyota Camry SE so there’s a good chance the warranty is still good so I had it towed to a Toyota car lot where they figured out the air filter that was replaced was not the correct one causing it to blow. I contacted the company and tomorrow a representative is going to go to where my car is and the Toyota mechanic is going to show them my car and tell them it’s their fault. 
Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? I’m hoping that they’ll just admit fault and pay for it because Toyota is saying it’s going to be $4,000 to fix it and I definitely don’t have $4,000. I already filed a claim with my insurance just in case. 
If they do not agree to pay damages, how should I go about getting a lawyer and all of that?
Has anyone had to go through something similar? If so, how did your situation turn out? 
I really don’t want to have to get an attorney, and I want to resolve this as quickly as a can because I am obviously now out of a car and need to go to work.

I live in NYC and am immunocompromised. Given the pandemic I do not want people coming and going from my apartment as I am high risk and do not want to risk my health. I told my landlord this and also said I would be happy to send him photos of the apartment along with a video walkthrough (what most rentals are doing during this time).

He’s not the best landlord and has often ignored my roommates and my concerns about the apartment (roof leaks, rotting supports, windows that don’t shut etc.).

"On final warning for sneezing?!? What are my rights? LOCATION: USA, Delaware

I am a temporary contractor and was just informed by my agency that someone reported to a manager that I did not cover my mouth when I sneezed two weeks ago and I am now on a final written warning, which means one more “incident” and I will be fired.  I have been working from home for the last two and a half weeks, have only gone to the building once in that time and we are required to wear masks when we go.  No one approached me about this issue, I was never placed on a verbal or written warning for this or anything else or even made aware that someone had reported me.

"Teenager looking for advice on helping a girl. Excuse grammar, please. I'm not in the best spot with this right now. Well, to start off, I'm 14, and ""dating"" a girl over the internet. She lives a couple of states away, so I can't help her very much myself. This information is also a little bit outdated, by a month or so. Keeping some of the details on how we met vague since those aren't relevant. I was told today her mom died, and that she was unplugging, so excuse any tangents, I just really want to be sure she's safe, and I can't do that for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

To start off with why there's a criminal tag, her stepdad is a real, and excuse my language, but the human shitstain makes me sick whenever I think about what he's done. He has, to list: raped her at least twice, beaten her, tried to touch her before, makes her feel like she can't breathe if he's near, watches her in a creepy manner from what I can tell, and he's apparently made her drink so she'll stop resisting him. Her mom wouldn't even let her talk about it, and now her mom certainly can't do anything, if she told the truth about the mom dying. She's tried DCS, told teachers, and has been taken into DCS custody before while they awaited a trial in which the mom said (falsely, which I know is a crime) that she would divorce the stepdad, but never did.  She's also got a 9-year-old brother, and from what I can tell, he's escaped most abuse, but I only heard about him a couple of days ago, and never asked again because I didn't want to bring the conversation to a place I knew was hard to talk about for her, and hard to hear for me. Back to the list of offenses by fuckstick of a stepdad: pulled a gun on her when he was drunk, threatened to kill her when she tried to run away, and undoubtedly more that she hasn't told me. I've advised family, but they're all in different states, I can't drive, and neither can she, since she's 14 as well. Teachers have filed reports, but they never went anywhere, she can't go to friends, so my last, and undoubtedly worst pieces of advice were to either rile up the neighbors into a lynching mob, or to just wait until she has a reasonable time to claim self-defense, and do the job herself (please don't judge me, but it's the only thing I could think of at like 10 pm when I just heard the darkest/most serious things I'd ever heard before). The next best option is she shares her address, which I'm not gonna ask her to do, and I'll go up and do the thing myself. I know I shouldn't, but if it means she's not in danger anymore, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'm begging you, Reddit, help me find out what she could do to get out of that situation, or if any custody lawyers read this, tell me where she'll go. Thank you.

"Ways to avoid a license suspension First post here. I was involved in an accident in AL after I relocated temporarily because of COVID-19. I hit my head and did not remember most of what happened prior, but because of some old empty containers that had been wedged under my seat for who knows how long, they felt they had probable cause to give me a breathalyzer (i hadn't been drinking). Rather than submit to the test, I repeatedly requested a lawyer which they took as a refusal and I was immediately charged with DUI. No field-sobriety was performed, and when they took me to the hospital to get the gash in my head stitched, they did not request blood either. I am getting a lawyer to fight the DUI.

Here's my question: Eventually AL will communicate w/ FL that I refused the BA, and when that happens, I will have a suspended driver's license and all the fun that goes along with that, including the conditions to get the license back, increased insurance etc., regardless of whether or not I'm convicted of DUI. 

Is there anyway to ""surrender"" my FL license before it's suspended, and thus avoid the black mark of it actually being suspended? I have a license that is valid from another state in case I need it, that I got renewed after all this happened. Any help would be appreciated."
"Breaking lease during covid I am a student in Chicago that was attending school. During spring break at the end of March, I moved home to help support family during the pandemic. I reached out to a leasing consultant in the beginning of April asking for a rent reduction given my circumstances. They've basically been incredibly slow answering my emails and it has gotten to the point where it is now May and I still have not been offered a solution. Last Sunday, I emailed the help desk stating that I cannot pay for both May and April so I would like to discuss terminating my lease. The leasing consultant contacted me again and stated that I should be expecting a call from the accounting office but that was 5 days ago. Feeling quite frustrated with this leasing company's poor communication and will have all my things out of that unit in 2 days. What can I do?"
"Hello, my store got a ticket [Cali] yesterday for selling for someone under 21. Now from the recording and everything the cashier asked the decoy “are you over 21” and she said “yes”. According to my knowledge a decoy cannot lie that she is over 21 and not be over. Opinion on the situation ?"
"Can Landlord Charge for Parking Hi!

Posting for my brother. He has been renting a place where he goes to college (Upstate NY) and is now moving into an apartment complex (its quite small--I'd call it a large house divided into units). In total there are probably 20 people who live in the complex and 10 parking spots. This upcoming term, when he signed his lease, he signed paperwork to be charged for off-street parking $300. He's worried, after living near the property, that he won't have a guaranteed spot even though he has paid. 

Can landlord charge all tenants for off-street parking even though there are not enough spots? This hasn't become a problem yet, but he is worried that it will become a problem once all students return to their apartment with their cars."
"Employer Pressuring Me to Return to Work, High Risk of Exposure, Emotional Distress I work at a very popular 5 star hotel in a major city in California. Occupants come from every major hub city around the world and are frequent travelers. Although occupancy is still nearly empty, the hotel is pressuring us to come in. When I expressed my concerns that a supply shortage of the adequate personal protective equipment coupled with high COVID infection rates in the area was very hazardous and unnecessary, and that it puts myself and my multi-generational family at risk. The pressure they are making me feel about losing my job or risking my life is causing debilitating panic attacks. The anxiety is 100% a result of the fear of returning to an unsafe workplace.

 I told them I wanted to speak to a psychiatrist and they shrugged it off. They said I can certainly do that in an unhelpful tone. I then asked "" Who is our worker's comp psychiatrist?"" and their whole tone changed. They politely told me they would contact HR for me and get back to me

My question, What recourse do I have here? 

After the death of my friend's father from COVID, the lack of N95 masks for the general public, and fear for my family I am unable to work here right now. Every time a co worker is sick, we all pass it around. I am not a paranoid person or germaphobe, but I know in every fiber of my being that having us return so soon is very dangerous 

 Thank you very much in advance, this is a great sub and I appreciate you folks"
"Vegetarian finds meat in food As the title suggests, I have been a vegetarian since 2013. Everytime I go out to eat I ask if there is any meat in what I am ordering. If there is I usually ask them to exclude it. Sometimes they do sometimes they dont. When they dont I bring it to their attention and just let them know I dont want it sent back and just take it to go for my dog (she eats better than i do lol). I dont send it back because I am scared from the movie waiting. I dont leave because just because i am not enjoying my food doesn't mean my friends cant enjoy there food. If I can avoid the place i dont go back. Today i order a breakfast burrito (rice, eggs, bean and cheese with veggies) and half way through my burrito I found a piece of ""carnitas"" staring at me. I opened the burrito and found more pieces of meat in it. Can I sue for this type of negligence and if yes what would inmeed to have a good case? Would I need photos?

"Covid advice please My sister, who is 18, has gone out with friends despite my parents telling her not to. She’s been in close contact with others and very well could have contracted covid-19, so we have asked her to isolate herself in her bedroom or the basement, providing her food and necessities of course. However, she doesn’t care, and constantly comes up to our living room and kitchen areas, lays on the couch, touches personal items, etc., despite us specifically telling her not to, for fear of contracting covid. My mom has asthma so she is especially at risk. If one of my family members or I was to contract the virus from my sister, could we do something about it?? I’m just sick of this shit, to be honest, and I’m scared, especially for my mom’s life. Please help!! Thank you."
"While working at a large fine dining steakhouse in so cal in late January 2020, I requested medical leave to go to rehab. In early March I finished, and called her for the first time and was told I was terminated after 30 days and everyone’s laid off right now anyways. Is this legal? She told me I didn’t reach out to her and she can only keep someone on payroll for 30 days without scheduling them. However, my friend who left the same company to work elsewhere but didn’t want to quit, is still on the staff and it’s been 6 months. Also, since everyone was getting laid off during that time anyways, it seemed not much could be done but file for unemployment. After I told her, “I didn’t know there was a limit on a medical leave.” And she informed me, “don’t worry, when we open up I’ll gladly hire you back”. However, she has not been responding to emails or keeping me in the loop as others have been. This cannot be legal correct? I also have emails asking when would be a good time for me to take off time to get clean and we worked something out. I have left a paper trail. I wasn’t able to contact her during that time as I had no phone or internet access, also I didn’t feel I needed to. I thought it was clear. Obviously there is a bias towards me compared to others who were in a similar situation (as far as taking time off) where I was terminated and they weren’t."

"How to best protect an adult leaving from abusive controlling home? (Tx) Hello,  everyone.

My friend (19F) has been living with her (emotionally) abusive aunt and uncle for nearly two years,  and she's finally ready to get out. I'm going to help her move, as is her bf. We have no plans to get violent or anything,  but we're not going to let them manipulate her into staying longer, either.

They are hyper-controlling, to the point of not wanting her to leave for a in-person apartment application (they are terrified of Covid, in-person is mandatory to get these apartments), which has pushed my friend over her limit,  and she wants out like this week.  (She's going to live with me both now and in the apartment we're applying for.)

Is there anything we need to know to help protect her?  Or anything her aunt and uncle can do to stop her? 

(Particular legal codes would be awesome,  I'd love to make it very clear to them that we have both the moral and legal high ground,  which I'm pretty confident we do.)

Also,  should we see if we can get a police officer to assist,  or call them only if they refuse to let her go? (At which point I think it'd be unlawful imprisonment,  right? )

We are in Travis County, Texas, for reference. Abusers do not have any sort of legal guardianship,  and parents have already approved of her moving out of their care (although I don't know if this new timetable has been discussed with them yet)."
"PLEASE HELP! My employer deleted my work email and wants me to email her through my personal email.. I'm sorry in advance, not sure if this is the right subreddit but I don't know where else to go. 

Okay so I was furloughed/laid off beginning of April. I work at an Ear, nose, throat surgery office as a medical assistant. My manager called me last week and asked me to return. I told her I could after 1 more week. My dad was in a car accident the day before and totaled his vehicle. Also he has many lung issues that are preexisting which means he's at high risk. After speaking with my dad that weekend, I emailed her through my work email and told her these concerns and asked her if I had any options? She called me the next morning and said it was fine if I didn't return yet and she understands and they can find someone else to cover me since they're only half staffed right now. I said okay and that I was a phone call away if they needed me back sooner than June 1st. I will also preface this by saying that I'm going to start school full time so June 30 was gonna be my last day no matter what (even before covid 19 happened). 
She just called me 2 days after that conversation and said she wants me to email her what we agreed to the other day. 
GET THIS! my work email doesn't log in anymore, when I had just used it the other day. I asked about this and she said ""just use your personal email"". She said this email is for documentation for their PPP loan. 
What is going on? Should I be worried? Are they trying to cut off my unemployment? I've been with them 2+ years. 

Btw my dad doesn't speak English so I'm helping him with all the legal issues involved with his accident right now and I can't be isolated from him since I'm staying there. 

what can I do please help!!

"Niece in a bad situation I'm desperate and have no idea where else to post this. I know I'm useless in this situation, but I want to know if she can even do anything. We live in Wisconsin.

My 14 year old niece was an unplanned pregnancy when my sister was 20. Her and my niece's father were together for about 6 months after she was born. My sister also found out he was cheating on her the entire pregnancy and got another woman pregnant at the same time. My sister holds an intense grudge against him, which has lead to her taking it out on my niece. My sister married a man not long ago and is starting a family with him, and my niece became an outcast. My sister is very mentally abusive (not physically that I know of) towards my niece, and everyone sees it except her. No one can talk sense into her.

So my niece decided to live with her dad. My sister completely ignores her texts and calls. Now, her father has his own family.. with the woman he cheated with my sister on. They have 4 other kids. My niece is yet another outcast in her step moms eyes. It's equally as bad.

My niece is incredibly mentally unstable and suicidal due to all of the mental abuse she's been going through since she was born. She has briefly talked about leaving everything behind and running off across country or taking her life.

She needs to get out of this situation ASAP. Either living with my mother (her grandma) or just anywhere but there. My mom really wants to help her, but she has no idea how. If I wasn't a financially unstable 20 year old, I would scoop her up in a heartbeat.

"Covid and UI benefits . - ADA Im in IL

&amp;#x200B;

My part-time employer from the last year is asking me to come back for 30ish hours on paper. To make sure they cover their PPP loan I imagine. The hours they're trying to pay me for will be just enough to take away my unemployment. I wasn't even averaging 30 hours before Covid . It being my 2nd job it will not be nearly enough for me to make ends meet even if I worked 40 hours there. There's no business considering its a hotel restaurant, and id only work 12-15 per week supposedly. I dont see them lasting the summer even though backed by the hotel money. I have been suffering from sometimes severe General Anxiety disorder last several years, and now that has signifanctly increased. Especially with thinking about having to go back to work there for a variety of reasons. Before Covid I sometimes had at work breakdowns and outburst form my anxiety , in which they're understanding of . They're asking for me to fill out some paperwork about why im not returning right now , and a doctors note excusing me from work until further notice. Will  a doctors note help me keep my UI right now with Covid going on and ADA-FMLA or will it mess up my UI ? Will me just quitting considering it was my second job and not enough compensation be good enough? Thank you ."

My employer has asked everyone in my company to isolate ourselves beyond what the guidelines in my state suggest, and has asked us to notify her if we do not do so. If we do so, we will not be allowed in our workplace for 2 weeks and may face other repercussions because we might have exposed ourselves to the virus. My question:

1. Can my employer control lawful activity conducted outside working hours?
2. Can she bar us from our workplace if we have disregarded her directive even if we show no symptoms?
3. Can she force us to disclose activity not conducted during working hours?

"Am I legally bound by my online order I live in Belgium and I was looking to buy some silver online.  I found a Dutch site and I started making an ordet to see how the ordrr process worked.  I had more in my cart than I actually wanted to purchase, but I was planning on modifying that once I had a better feel for the order process.

There were 2 payment options, bank transfer or an iDeal card that I didn't have.  I chose for the bank transfer. At one point there was a checkbox to say that you accept the conditions and I rapidly read it and selected the option.  I was expecting to go to another screen, but when I clicked next the order was done.

I am in a total pamic now because I was not planning to order and the conditions were very strict.  No retraction or cancelation by buyer.  Buyer is responsible for all legal fees.  In case of any issues legal fees of at least 150 euros would be charged.

I feel helpless and trapped and am really worried that I may have made a big mistake.

I find it hard to believe that I could be held responsible for purchasing the order just because I slected a checkbox as I haven't signed anything

They expect payment within 3 work days according to their general conditions. . 

This is probably more a question for a European or Dutch law specialist, but I am hoping that someone who knows about these things is reading this and can help me.  I could send the link for the conditions via a PM.  I don't want to post it here as it could be seen as bad publicity for them.

"Help with response to summons deadline may 11th Ok so I was served with summons for lawsuit from car accident in 2018. I had received a settlement in 2019. I'm now the defendant and have tried legal aid, etc. To make this short I have been trying to get help since day after being served. I can only leave messages and am still waiting for response and list of attorneys from legal aide. The attorney who represented me for accident does not answer my messages or emails for copies of documents etc. (You name it , I have been in contact and told no they will not be getting involved.) So I need to atleast file my response on time with the court. I'd really like more time since walk ins will be allowed in my area in PBC Florida on May 11th.
I understand I need to admit, deny or state I have no knowledge to each of the 12 items. 

Example #5 : At all times pertinent to this action, A.S. Subrogor , the owner of vehicle that is subject of this  action, and the occupants of said vehicle, covered by a policy of insurance issued by Plaintiff Geico General Insurance Company providing Uninsured/ Underinsured Motorist benefits pursuant to terms and conditions of said policy.

Yeah I know the guy had Geico and I had Progressive. I dont know what his policy means. There is exhibit A attached of 47 pages of policy which I cant understand. How do I respond correctly to say party admit partly deny? Or what would be correct terms to use?

For example #9 states :

On or about date mentioned plaintiff was suffered serious bodily injury as a result of defendant's negligence operating mother vehicle.

I want to say I deny this. That the plaintiff ran red light while speeding resulting in severe bodily injury to myself and daughter. Is this too much info.? Should I just say deny and move on to next? 

From what I do understand I'm supposed to attach evidence supporting my claim. I'm trying to get copies of independent 911 call my attorney used to get me a settlement but like I said, he will not respond to my email or phone messages for this request even though he said it would be mailed out weeks ago. I feel like there are some documents that I could add but I dont physical have them to use. 
Example # 10 :

As a direct and proximate result of (me) 's negligence, and pursuant to terms and conditions of the aforementioned policy of insurance, Plantiff was forced to pay the sum of $100,000.00 in uninsured/ underinsured motorist benefits for personal injuries suffered by Mr. A.S.
I want to deny. But how do I say correctly that plaintiff hit me and his insurance paid me. ( my insurance was basic and he could have received small amount but my insurance claims adjuster told me they didn't pay him a penny because they found him at fault.) Is less said the better in statement responses? Should I just say no knowledge? 
What I would like to say in whole is I deny this because plaintiff ran a red light speeding hit us totaled car and I got some money. Now plaintiff and his insurance are coming after us for that money. But I dont know how to properly word this.

Ex #12 : plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent required of it to for bringing this action against defendants, and no facts exist that would constitute either set off to this debt or a counterclaim against plaintiff. 

How should I know? I'm not in legal field. Can I say I have no Knowledge? Or do I say I deny ?
My accident was word against word. It was settled with lawyers and insurance co. no court involved, no case in system. 

I appreciate any help in this matter. And I do apologize if this is confusing. I am not trying to waste anyone's time."

"Noisy Neighbors [CA] I recently had new neighbors move in upstairs. They moved in two weeks ago, and there's been bumping and banging going on since they moved in. I live in an older building, so I know and understand that some noise is going to be heard, and in get that they are probably still making furniture and getting settled in. That's fine with me.
What's not fine with me is that they make the noise until midnight or later (I have to be up at 4:30am for work), and they let their toddler RUN all day through the apartment. All we hear all day from the kid is BOOM BOOM BOOM while it stomp runs through their house. I've already talked to them once about it and they said, ""oh sorry. We will keep it down."" But they haven't kept it down. 
I've called the office and talked to them about the noise, and they've spoken with the neighbors about it. But the noise is still ridiculous. 
What can I do at this point? 

As an afterthought I'd like to be clear on something. I understand that kids run and play. I get it. But it's unacceptable for them to let their kid run and stomp as often as they do. It's about 70% of the day that there is running and stomping."
