"[meta] It's not required, but if you make a new account _just_ to post to Relationship Advice, please start the account with `ThrowRA` in the name of your account. [yes this relaxes the rule a bit. An update on the Updates Rule is in here as well] **TL;DR on Throwaways:** If you wish to request relationship advice, please start your new username with `ThrowRA` -- it relaxes the content checks a bit on your post.

**TL;DR on Updates:** If you post updates: try to limit it to just one _unless_ you're asking for follow-up advice, and don't ever feel obligated to update everyone here.

---

**For regulars:** We took a LOT of good feedback on the two new rules (the Updates rule and the Throwaways rule). We're hoping this is a pretty good compromise between the concerns everyone raised versus the need to defuse some of the more prolific trolling:

 1. **Throwaways:** We relaxed the rule such that we're _not automatically removing every post from a new account._ In other words, every account can post to /r/relationship_advice.
* One bit of feedback we got is that a ton of people who post here are posting from new accounts because they've been led here from other platforms, e.g. facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc., for help. Knowing this, we changed how we're handling the rule. 
* That said, while we're applying content checks to posts more rigorously when they don't begin with `ThrowRA`, it's never an automatic removal.
* _yes, we stopped checking for the hyphen (It used to be `ThrowRA-`; now it's just `ThrowRA` and not case-sensitive). Apparently it's almost impossible to copy the text on mobile and include the hyphen, and tons of people were just forgetting it, so we dropped the hyphen._

 2. **Updates:** Updates asking for specific follow-up advice are totally fine. Updates that don't actually ask for advice are limited to only one.
* We recognize the gaping loophole this appears to leave, but honestly, it keeps the comments on-track with advice-focused conversation rather than derailed threads on unrelated topics like politics. 
* Apparently a lot of you _really_ like updates. So we're trying to strike a balance between updates and new posts.
* Any update that asks for specific follow-up advice (""Hey Reddit; I did this thing from my last thread, and this happened. How do I fix this?"") are totally fine.
* But back to back updates (""Hey Reddit! I did this thing today!"" day 2: ""Hey Reddit! Life's pretty good now!"" day 3: ""Hey Reddit! Thanks for all your help, we'll be together after all!"") -- Those can be condensed all into one post; the play-by-play isn't needed.
* In all honesty, I personally communicated this rule _very_ poorly. I'm genuinely sorry about that.

We'll revisit this during the next seven days to see how it's going with an open discussion thread at that point.

"[meta] One (1) day bans for moral judgment posts e.g. Am I the asshole? Who's right? Was I wrong? Am I the problem? etc. || Also, COVID-19 resources (thanks /u/ebbie45!). We get the stress from social isolation is bad, but the subreddit is for asking what to do next, not whether what you did up until now was right or wrong.

The last time we posted this thread, we saw a pretty healthy self-correction, but we had to swap it out for COVID-19 resources (thanks, /u/ebbie45!) as the pandemic took hold. But now that we're neck deep in the pandemic itself, people seem to be resorting to using the subreddit to get a public judgment on their own household arguments. As said above, that's _not_ what the subreddit is meant for, and it makes it harder to mod the more serious topics where people actually have no one to turn to. As a result:

#One (1) day bans for Moral Judgment posts.

If that's hard to understand, consider whether you're asking questions that sound even remotely like the following:

* Am I the asshole--?

* Am I, or was I, wrong for--?

* Who's right here?

* Does anyone else--?

* Should/could I have done something differently in the past? 
 * _(this is different from asking ""Should I do [this thing] or [that thing]?"" in the future, which is allowed because it's a specific request for what to do next.)_

To be clear: if you ask questions that sound at all like the above, it's a one (1) day ban.

We're not taking comments on this.

"My 35f partner livid at me 33m for not wanting to go spend Mother’s Day with her family? My partner is giving me the silent treatment and has been doing so for two days straight. She wants me to go over to her parents house and celebrate Mother’s Day as I haven’t done so since 2017. In 2017 I lost my mother to cancer who died in my arms and was such a pivotal character in my life. I have a deep fear of cancer and I have no living family, so I’ve attended a lot of therapy to get to the point where I can be a more contributing member of society. On Mother’s Day I like to pace myself. I’m an introvert as well and her family are very outgoing. I love them but I really need quiet on Mother’s Day or I fall to pieces.

She told me it’s been years and I need to get on with it. I told her it isn’t that simple. I’ve paid for half of her mothers present, I’ll call and wish her a happy Mother’s Day but I find it near impossible to force myself to socialise and have the pianola playing and constant singing and overall loudness, it makes me depressed and uneasy.

She told me I was selfish and I need to suck it up. I told her she doesn’t understand what it is like to lose a parent, especially your only one, people grieve in different ways. I’m able to function outside of that day and attend all christmases and birthdays all I request in that one day for myself but yet I feel so guilty about it.

Should I suck it up and go for her? I love her but I’m taken aback by her cold disdain for my feelings regarding this. 

TD;LR: My 35f partner angry at me 33m for not attending Mother’s Day, should I go?"
"My (32F) boyfriend (45m) asked me if I love our baby more than him. In all seriousness. And then didn't like my answer. This is honestly so stupid. I've been thinking about it literally all night and not only can I not get over how stupid it is, I can't get over how stupid it is that I'm upset about it.

We've been together for 2.5 years. Our relationship has been pretty uncomplicated. He is a needy person, but Ive never seen it as being in a weird way. More in the respect that his love language is quality time and our one on one time is really important to him. 

We just had our first child a few weeks ago. Obviously, being a baby, he needs a LOT of time and a LOT of attention and he's basically disrupted our lives in a major way. I have to say that my boyfriend is a good hands on dad so far. He's totally cool with changing diapers and responding to him when he cries and things. I've been trying to encourage bonding in other ways like just holding him and cuddling him, but he's not really into that. He's good otherwise. 

I haven't been ignoring my boyfriend by any means. We still have phone free time when the baby is asleep and we try to eat dinner together at the table together still. But obviously it's not just the two of us anymore. And like...I love the baby. I am *obsessed* with the baby. I feel like that's a pretty normal maternal sentiment. I could spend all day just holding him and kissing him and singing to him and talking to him and admiring his little baby toes and fingers and marveling over him. He's a work of art. He's incredible. 

This was a two part thing that happened today. We got takeout for dinner and I went to get the food off the porch while holding the baby and then came up and started setting it up on the table without setting him down. My boyfriend walked into the room and asked ""do you ever put the fucking baby down?"" which kind of took me by surprise and I think I said something lame like ""I like holding him"". I put him in his swing while we were eating and it kind of got forgotten. Then a little while later after dinner, I was sitting on the couch with him. He was really alert so I was talking to him and cooing at him and he was responding and being really cute, we were listening to music and I was making him dance with his arms and singing in silly voices. You know, baby stuff. At some point my boyfriend came into the room and went and sat in the chair opposite us. I offered him to come sit on the couch, he said no, I was like, okay, and went back to interacting with the baby. He didn't make any move to make conversation or anything, he turned on the Switch and started playing it, which was fine, whatever. Eventually the baby started to get fussy so I was feeding him and I was just playing with his hair and I said something like ""oh buddy I love you so much"". My boyfriend turned off the game and asked if he could ask me a question, I said sure, and he said ""Do you love him more than you love me?"" I wasn't sure if I heard him right so I asked him to repeat it and he said ""Do you love (our son) more than you love me?"" 

I literally didn't know what to say to that. I said ""It's a whole different kind of love, it would be like asking me if I liked my favorite song more than my favorite color, you can't even compare it."" He said ""I think you love him more. Ever since he was born, it's just been all about him."" I looked at him like he was a fucking alien and said ""Well, yeah, that's how babies work?"" He got mad, turned off the game, and went out to the garage (he works on projects out there). I was kind of shocked. He stayed out there for a few hours and then came back in and started getting ready for bed. He announced that he was going to sleep in the spare room tonight, but that he didn't expect me to care because I don't love him as much as the baby.

I got annoyed and told him that while that wasn't what I was saying, it was pretty clear that he had made up his mind about it and if he was going to believe such a silly thing then he could go ahead and believe it. He replied that if it wasn't true, I'd be willing to argue with him to prove it. I was like ok whatever dude go to bed, and he went. That was the last thing we said to each other.

Honestly, I've been pretty upset about it. I understand now why they say never to go to bed angry because it's hard to deal with the unresolved issues, plus postpartum hormones are still making me crazy and it's making me really sad.

The TL;DR version of this:

My boyfriend decided that I don't love him as much as our baby and said that if it wasn't true I'd have been willing to argue with him about it when I told him it was a silly argument that I wasn't going to participate in. 

1) Am I wrong that it was silly? Or is he being absolutely ridiculous?

2) If I am wrong, how do I rectify it? 

Thanks."
"My neighbors autistic son (14) is obsessed with my home arcade and we have become a day care for him My family and our neighbors are pretty close, our kids are around the same age and we spend a lot of time at each others houses.  They have a 14 year old who is autistic and overall is a really good kid but is prone to outbursts which is common for his situation and we understand/accept it.  Back in February, before Covid-19 happened, I built a home arcade machine which looks like what you would see in an arcade but you are able to play any classic game you could think of which I had been wanting for a long time.  The next time they came over, I was showing them my new toy and their son completely lit up and started playing.  And he played and played and played all night long.  His parents were so relieved to have some time off and I was happy to give them that.

Then came the aftermath.   The next day he was asking to come back over to play and they said no and he had a fit.  Then they asked me if he could come over and play and I of course said sure.  So he played while me and his Dad hung out which was fine.  Then it became a daily thing with him and his dad coming over for a couple of hours which then morphed into his dad dropping him off to play the machine because he ""had to run some errands or a similar excuse.""  So we became his day care and while he would just be fixated on the machine, we had to make sure he was drinking water and make him stop to use the bathroom every couple of hours which was a battle.  His parents have said thanks but haven't really acknowledged that we became his day care which is annoying.

With Covid we had to shut down contact and he apparently did not take it well and has been asking about playing the games again several times a day.  Now that things appear to be easing up, I know the situation will pick back up again.  My question is how should we respond if they try to do the drop off game again?  I understand his special needs but at the same time, we have our own kids to take care of and them acting like we can be his day care is not going to work.

Edit:  I don't mind the kid coming over and I actually enjoy seeing the joy he gets from playing the games (and he found a couple of games on the system that I completely forgot about which was cool) but I feel like they are taking advantage of the situation by having us watching on the regular.  I thought about working with them to build their own type of system but I know money was really tight with them before Covid so that might not work either."
"My (25M) Fiancé (26F) is sending nudes online and doesn’t know I know I found out that my Fiancé has been sending nudes to guys online. She cheated on me last year but we worked on things and now I found this. This is my first relationship, not first “serious” just first. She’s the only person I’ve ever connected with, this sucks, why do people suck?

Is it over? 

I think I know the answers it just hurts so much, we have so much. How do I do this? How do I move on? What helps?"
Just found out my (29M) wife (28F) has been sleeping with my best friend. We have been together for 12 years. 3 of them as husband and wife. We have two children together. I’m not sure what to do anymore.
"My wife of 4 years is looking to cheat. Also I think she cheated before the marriage with an ex-boss. We have a 3 y.o. My marriage has been a difficult road. My SO and I have been together 9 years, married for almost 4. We are living in London, all my wife’s family are in a European country, all of mine are in Australia. We are in our mid 30s.

We found out my wife was pregnant 5/6 weeks after we were married. 

Before marriage I felt like we had a happy life, living together for more than 4 years. We were both very independent, but we enjoyed food, movies, holidays together etc. We certainly had busy work lives but made time. I came into the relationship very sexually inexperienced with only 2 previous parners, and I was a virgin until 25. I feel like we had a good sex life until marriage, it wasn’t hugely satisfying/exciting and I think we lacked communication skills all around.

It’s been a really hard road the last two years. We have not had any intimacy or sex, our lives revolve around our son, who we love so much. Communication has been difficult. I have suggested marriage councelling but she refused. I went to a GP for low mood and was prescribed antidepressants about 5 months ago.

The lockdown has obviously made things much more difficult, we have been even more distant and finding it 10x harder without work as a focus- we are both furloughed.

This morning she left her phone unlocked. I know this is a betrayal of trust but I looked at her last text. It was to someone talking about the logistics of meeting. My wife mentioned meeting and having sex in her car.

Seeing this was really upsetting and fairly shocking. I delved further.

Before getting married I once had a suspicion my then SO cheated. One night after she had been out to a work party she left her panties in the bathroom floor. I saw them and they were completely wet and sticky. I confronted her about this and she talked me down and said she had had an accident as was busting to go to the toilet.

Anyway I looked further into her past texts. I saw her old boss and opened. It was from 2015, 6 months before we were engaged. She had sent him a topless pic of a beach holiday, pictures of her in green panties which said she had worn that colour because he asked, and a few other sexual messages. Nothing explocitly about sex. One she sent said ‘you know my body’. She has been on a few ‘girl only holidays’ but other than that never spent the night out of our bed or anything. But if it was a work colleague she would have had lots of opportunity.

So I’m now not talking to my wife. I know she wants to separate. I always felt having a baby put too much pressure on both of us, that it changed our lives too much and took away our independence.

But now I feel like the whole relationship and marriage is based on deceit, that I have been blindsided.

My son turns 3 on Wednesday and I don’t want to discuss/confront her at all until after. I don’t even know if it is worth confronting her at all. I so want a happy nuclear family but that picture has faded so fast.

I want to talk to my mum, I feel kind of ashamed to tell her. She lives on the other side of the world. Apart from making sure I am being a good dad, what do you suggest I do? I recently started a keto diet and am exercising more. I will sleep on the couch from here on out.

Any advice is hugely appreciated."
"I (19yo M) am getting my girlfriend (18yo F) who's going into nursing school an engraved stethoscope. I know it's nothing dire but I want to get something engraved that would be thoughtful and sweet but idk what to write, I've been thinking on it for a month but I can't think of anything thats not too sappy but also something just sweet enough to make her smile on her long days in classes and her even longer days on shift."
"My (21M) autistic room-mate (20M) asked my soon-to-be GF (21F) out on a date and now feels extremely guilty I have a roommate, aged 20. I’ll call him Travis, and he’s autistic. Not majorly, but noticeably. I’ve known him for a few months and he’s really fun and usually happy, albeit quiet and a little withdrawn.

Today, my female friend came over. Whilst she isn’t my girlfriend, we have both agreed that it is our goal to have a relationship. Personal issues, which I won’t get into, make it difficult, at the moment.

She came to our house today and sat in the garden with us both, at which point she went inside to use the W/C. Travis said she was very pretty, to which I agreed. He then asked “is she your girlfriend”. I replied “I hope eventually she will be”.

And he said “so she isn’t your girlfriend?” and I replied rather foolishly “no”. Travis then left the house for a while, not upset in any way, perhaps more upbeat than usual. He returned about a half hour later with a small bouquet of flowers (I later found out he had picked them from his mother’s garden).

He presented them to my female friend and asked her out on a date. She was shocked, as was I, but was very nice and politely declined. Travis didn’t seem to mind so much, and gave her the flowers to keep anyway, which she did. He sat with us cheerfully for a while longer. It was a little awkward for us, but he didn’t seem to mind, and we didn’t either.

He eventually retired to his room to play video games, and was happy as usual. Laughing and shouting at the television as he always does. I told him I was leaving to take my girlfriend home and he waved bye-bye to her. When I returned home, I went into Travis’ room and told him that I meant she was my soon-to-be-girlfriend.

He immediately got very upset and apologised profusely for “emasculating”. I assured him he had not and told him we were cool. He seemed to calm down but later I saw him crying whilst staring at his bedroom wall. I assured him we were ok and cool, but he continued to apologise for his perceived emasculation of me.

I don’t have the contact numbers for any of his family, so I’m at a loss on how to reassure him. Any advice?"
"My wife [32] and I [32M] had a miscarriage. Now she’s a saying she doesn’t want any more kids (we have one) and has been distancing from me. I hate that I’m typing this. 


I really hate it. 


I’ve been with my wife for 15 years. We’ve been married for 6. We have a wonderfully amazing 3 year old daughter. We had a miscarriage on our second last summer and shits been a mess. 


My wife has really bad mood swings. Maybe it’s undiagnosed bipolar depression. I don’t know. It’s been bad for a few years and has been on a few different pills over the last few years. Nothing sticks. She’s tough to be around, and that was before the miscarriage. 


Now, she has refused sex with me for about 10 months. We never had a great sex life but she’s completely shut me down. I can’t even touch her, she pushes me away. 



She’s really irritable, all the time. I’m a rather easy going person, but she’s pushed me to the brink lately and honestly, I’ve gotten so used to her anger / temper that I just don’t fucking care anymore when she’s angry. Because it’s all the time. It doesn’t even phase me anymore. She goes to bed 4/7 nights a week angry at me and I literally just don’t care because I’m done crying about it. 


Now, she’s telling me she doesn’t want any more kids. She’s done. We always said, since college, we wanted 3-4. And now she’s done. That’s not fair, I don’t get a say? Sorry, I’m a damn good dad. We share a ton of the parenting responsibilities. I wanted more kids. 



I’m really afraid she’s just going to up and leave me to be honest. It would probably be over nothing .. she gets mad at me for everything .. But I’m starting to add it all up and I’m thinking she’s just not in love with me anymore. 


Tonight she went to bed without saying goodnight. Again. It was after a rant about how we don’t do anything together anymore. First of all, COVID.. second of all, we just did a virtual cooking class last weekend. We go for hikes every weekend. I don’t understand what she’s talking about. And I tell her that and I’m just done defending my effort. Nothing is good enough. 


I’ve written her notes. She rips them up. I give her gifts. She’s unphased. I let her sleep in and take care of my daughter. She wakes up angry. 


I can’t make her happy. I don’t even know if I’m happy. And shits not getting better

I don’t know if anyone is going to actually read this but if you did .. wow, thank you. Any advice? What do I do? Where do I go from here? Is she going to leave me? Has she already left?"
"Sex is over when my husband (41M) cums and I’m (44F) not happy about it I am 44F, married 15 years to 41M, good sex drive, and apparently now having sex means I ride him til he cums, the he rolls over and goes to sleep and I’m just left to...? I can’t cum from PiV (he is on the smaller side and it does very little for me), but usually he would at least stay somewhat engaged while I got off with a vibrator after. Am I supposed to just put up with this? Is this what sex after 40 is like? 

I know the correct answer is to sit him down sometime and explain politely that I would like my needs met too. But the fact that he doesn’t already get this, after all these years, is really kind of unacceptable, no? He can’t be that clueless."
"Am i right to feel less loved when my fiancee of 1 year tells me i am no more or less important than her friends. Hi all. I decided to make this post to get some opinions on this matter. Im 26m and she's 27f. We have lived together for almost a year after i moved to her. Long story short, she came back after spending a few hours with a friend, lets call her A, she was there to repair some damage to their friendship. Well she told me after coming home that she told A that her friendship with A was just as important as her relationship to me, (were engaged). She later clarrified that her friendships are just as important to her as her relationship but that im the most important fiancee and that she does indees love me. To a point i understand she has had many partners whoes shes loved and then fallen out of love with, they come and go but her friends, well they have always been there in her life so i understand im just the latest guy to maybe leave her one day so why prioritise me the most. But to me she is the most important person second to none. My question is am i wrong to feel hurt and am i making her choose her me over her friends?. Also  is it strange to not love your partner the most?, i know partner love is different to friends and family love but she loves us equally and idk i just find this odd. Im not that close to my friends or family so maybe i just dont get it and sgoudnt be too hard on her, what are your tgoughts?"
"I’m tired of being the one who always does more I love my friends and love doing things for them. I never do anything expecting anything in return, I just genuinely enjoy making them happy. But I’ve realized I put most of the effort into my friendships. I’m always the one taking weekends off of my busy schedule to attend their birthday weekends, or making the long-distance trip to hang out, or spending significant amounts of money for gifts/ travel, or even remembering special events of theirs. But most of them can’t even remember to send a happy birthday text and only give me empty promises about making a trip to see me. My friends are genuinely kind-hearted people and have otherwise been good to me, but I’ve just been feeling like I put so much effort into people who wouldn’t do the same for me. Am I being dramatic? Is this something I should bring up or is it better to just slowly distance myself from them?"
"I opened my daughter’s package and it turned out to be a sex toy. This is my first time posting because I really don’t know what to do. Basically me and my daughter (17) have the same first and last name. It’s happened so many times before that we exchanged packages, I would never open anything that I knew wasn’t mine. But I’ve been ordering a lot of stuff lately and when the package arrived, it didn’t have a middle name on it and since a lot of my orders were supposed to arrive this week, I just assumed it was mine. I opened it up and turns out it’s definitely not mine. It’s some type of sex toy, a dildo or something like that. I was a bit shocked that my daughter ordered it. But the worst is that I don’t know what to do now because the package is visibly ripped, how do I make it look like it hasn’t been open before or how do I tell my daughter that I mistakenly opened her package. I think it’d be pretty embarrassing for both of us. I don’t know what to do now."
"I found out my girlfriend did sexual things with her ex after she said she loved me, and I don’t know how to feel. So I met this girl around November and we started FaceTiming and talking and we go to the same school and everything.  I confessed feelings for her in the beginning of December, and by the end of December, we both confessed that we loved each other.  However, we weren’t officially dating I guess.  I found out that she had planned a trip to go see her ex in NY before she had met me and couldn’t get out of it.  I was worried, but I trusted her because she said I had nothing to worry about and she didn’t feel for him that way. She left at the end of December and got back around January 1.  Once she got back though, she was distant and said she didn’t know if she had feelings for him and decided to choose between us, which made me feel like an option.  She chose me though, and we’ve been dating ever since.  

A week and a half or so ago, the topic came up again and I found out she had done sexual things with him on the trip.  She said she felt guilty and didn’t plan on doing it but said she doesn’t want to feel bad anymore because she felt bad for months and we weren’t official yet and it just happened, but it feels wrong to me.  I loved her at the time and it makes me really feel like shit.  I still love her and she loves me and we’ve moved past it but she still talks to him and it makes me uncomfortable.  They have more history than we have and I get worried that she’s going to leave me.

Am I paranoid?  And is it ok for me to feel bad about what she did?  I just want to get over it and feel confident that she won’t leave me."
How do I tell my girlfriend I like it hairy? Without being weird Recently I’ve been wanting my girlfriend to grow her pubic hair but I don’t want her to think I’m weird . I see it in porn and I like it a lot  but my girlfriend shaves all the time . Usually you get questions of guys wanting their girlfriend to shave so I feel like a psychopath asking for the opposite. Will she think I’m weird ?
"Messy wife I don’t even want to come home This is my first time posting in this forum. I’m not one to seek out advice or opinions from strangers, but after reading through some posts I think you can help with my dilemma. 

I have reached my limit with how much mess and inconsiderate behavior I can tolerate. My wife has successfully messed up every room in the house. Messed up being put stuff in the room that does not belong or taken things out and left them where used. She also takes things that I need every day, uses them up and then doesn’t tell me or replace them. Ok so some examples. I redid our master bathroom. All new furniture floors etc..  at this point the closet is stuffed with dirty clothes and empty shampoo bottles, the cabinets are covered in soap, there is at least 4 baskets of laundry in the room and anything metal has rusted because she uses bleach when “cleaning”. It’s gotten so bad I moved to the guest bath. Now she comes in there and messes up the sink, takes my soap from the shower or my towel. Kitchen is even worse. This is not a lie. I do the dishes on Sunday night and by Tuesday all the glasses(a top rack of dishwasher amount)are used and strewn about the house. (She is working from home). I built a coffee bar in the kitchen and she has not stacked it with files and amazon purchases, dog stuff etc..  I’ve also moved my clothes into the guest bedroom because she would rummage through my drawers and take socks and under ware to the point I did not have any. And I mean they were gone in some laundry pile. The bedroom floor is so cluttered there is only a small path to get to the bed. I try to clean but she gets angry at me and now with her at home I can’t even “sneak clean”. 

It bothers me so much I am constantly agitated. I have expressed this to her and she acknowledges it but doesn’t change anything. Any advice ?

I’ll post a couple pictures so you don’t think I’m over reacting."
"Am I the crazy one? My boyfriend does not seem to think covid is much of a big deal.  I, on the other hand, am feeling extremely vulnerable and unsafe.  I'm pregnant and we live in a remote area where, if I end up contracting covid, they will send me to a hospital 5 hours away, where I will have to spend the remainder of my pregnancy (unless they come up with a cure or vaccine in that time, presumably).  Three times in a row last week, my boyfriend went and hung out with friends, without wearing a mask, at which point I told him I would be isolating from him for 14 days.  

Yesterday was Day 8 of self-imposed isolation and we'd been doing a good job not crossing paths.  Then I walked into another room and I overheard him talking to someone.  He'd invited over a friend and they were talking outside.  I was so upset.  I just feel like we need to be minimizing unnecessary interactions and risks.  He thinks I'm being crazy and told me it's impossible to keep up with ""my rules"" that ""keep changing.""  ""My rules"" have only ever been following CDC guidelines, which include wearing a mask and do not include unnecessary play dates?  I know he struggles with being indoors all the time.  He struggles without human interaction.  He gets depressed.  But you know who else is struggling with those things right now?  Fucking.  EVERYBODY.  

CDC guidelines aside, I also just feel like if any of my behavior upset him as much as this is upsetting me, whether I agreed with him or not, I would change that behavior -- because I love him and I respect him and I want him to feel safe with me.  Instead of changing his behavior, he just argues with me about why I'm wrong  and it makes me feel like he doesn't care about me, my feelings, my health or safety or the health and safety of our child.

But maybe I'm overreacting and this all stems from pregnancy hormones.  Some outside insight would be helpful.  Please and thank you."
"My [m37] cousin [m25] refuses to pay me back for a table he used the bathroom on I have a table in my backyard that I built to clean fish on.  It’s got a hole right in the middle of it that I sit a bucket under and sweep all of the nasty bits into.  Today I came home from work to grab lunch and see my cousins truck in the driveway.  I walk around back just in time to see a log of shit falling onto the ground and my cousin on top of the table with his pants around his ankles.  He may or may not have also been slightly aroused, I don’t know the normal state of his penis. 

I shouted at him and he got startled and hopped off.  As I start laying into him about what the fuck he was doing he hoses his ass off and then just sprayed the shit into the ground with the hose. 

His story is essentially that he stopped in for an emergency shit in the woods behind my house because he couldn’t make it home and saw the table and “couldn’t resist”. He said he really wanted to know what shitting on his back felt like.  

At the time I was too flustered to think and just told him to go the fuck home.  Later I texted him and told him he needed to pay me back for the materials used in the table because I wouldn’t be using it anymore and he refused.  He said it wasn’t that big of a deal and he’s short on cash.  Honestly that’s the part I’m most annoyed about however the fact that he just sprayed shit all over my yard right next to my patio is definitely a close second.

The whole situation is so weird I don’t know what to do. A part of me just feels like shaming him to the whole family but he’s an adult so it’s not like my aunt and uncle can make him pay me.  Should I just give up on it or should I tell our family? I haven’t even told my wife yet. 


TLDR; cousin shit through a hole in my table.  Won’t pay for a new table."
"Cutting off the weirdest relationship I've ever had in my life \[Trigger warning: suicide\] TDLR at the bottom. 

I'm making this post because I wanted to let you know it does get better. I'm (27,F) and he is (31,M). We'll call him T.

After 8 long years (or almost my entire 20's), I finally cut him off. Something I've wanted to do for years but simply never had enough courage to do. I fell deeply in love with a Narcissist and was played like a fiddle.

I formed a friendship with a guy that I really adored. We spoke everyday for hours and loved being around one another. At the 2 year mark of our friendship I knew I had strong feelings for T but I kept it to myself as to not destroy the friendship. Those feelings were a slow burn but hit me like a truck. I had a deep gut feeling that we would end up together. He made me extremely happy, he brought out the best in me and I've never felt so sure about anyone in my life. 

Boy, I couldn't have been more naive and wrong.

He suddenly began dating his room mate, someone he had never mentioned once yet we spoke every single day. Their relationship literally came out of nowhere and he rubbed it in my face at the time. This is where it gets strange. He claimed he was dating another guy and while shocked as I didn't know he was into men, I supported him regardless.

A week later he told me it's actually a girl (someone I've met a few times). I asked him why he lied and he said that he enjoys fucking with people's heads. We drifted after this for obvious reasons. I should have stayed gone but all those years ago my dumb 21 year old self wanted to see the best in everyone, especially him.

Around 6 months later we became really close again, talking every day, having a good laugh. We flirted and he invited me to come visit him and I took it as an opportunity to see a few other friends in the city. I flew 7 hours to go check out the city and see him solo.

A few days before I was due to go home he invited me out for drinks with his friend there. I arrived and they were just finishing dinner which seemed weird. He spent the entire night ignoring me, flirting with his friend and throwing ice cubes out of his drink at me randomly. 

We left the bar to go back to his friends house, and I awkwardly took my leave as they were heavily flirting with each other and he stayed the night. I think he invited me to a date he was on with his friends with benefits. I felt humiliated. He cut contact with me shortly afterwards, telling me how 'weird I acted' (you gotta be kidding me).

He rose out of the woodwork again a year later, acting like everything was normal between us. This threw me. It had been too long and it re-triggered all of those feelings. I finally admitted my feelings to T and he rejected me and he said to make up for it, his friend with benefits would help me find an apartment if I ever move into the city. I thanked him, refused his offer (that's a firm **nope**) and cut contact. I felt proud of myself stepping up and admitting this, but truthfully I was devastated. He wasn't the person I thought he was.

This is when the revolving door began spinning and with each encounter he mocked me, was rude to me and made me feel like shit for no reason. He would come in and out of my life consistently, be rude, then disappear again.

A year later, I was in a serious and happy relationship with someone else and living in his city due to a job offer and to look after a friends house. And T pops back up again. This time telling me that I would love this and this around the city. I said well, why don't we all go together? He immediately shot it down, stating his girlfriend wouldn't like us hanging out and said suddenly ""I DON'T WANT TO GO!!"". His sudden outburst freaked me out. I advised him I was in a relationship and we have no sexual or romantic history so I don't see the issue. He disappeared again.

In 2019, T pops up again but in a different way. This time I see that he has randomly blocked me across social media. We hadn't spoken in a year. I have no idea where this came from. 

This is when I found out he has criminal ties in a famous downtown core with the police and lawyers in that area, and he now hides his identity everywhere online as a result. I believed that was it, I made my peace with it and didn't think of him again (while also thankful we weren't closer).

Until 2 months ago, when he came out of the woodwork messaging me at 4am. Hours later he called me from a bank on the morning of our mutual friends funeral to tell me the news of her passing. She had taken her own life 3 weeks prior and he waited until the day of the funeral to tell me, then spent the entire phone call talking about his bank errands and his vacation coming up. My brain couldn't register what the hell was happening. He had such a casual tone. 

I have no clue why he waited until the day of a funeral to inform me of this but it felt extremely off and somewhat callous. Never asked if I was okay after unloading this on me. I was in shock and explained to him that I have questions about her family and the arrangements and how I could help in anyway, and that I need some comfort as I'm not in touch with anyone else who knew her.

I was pushing for responses and got nothing back. He ghosted me again when I needed him most. To me, this was deplorable. The way he told me with such sheer casual indifference was unbelievable.

I sent him a message stating that I think it's time to be done with this, that I care about him deeply but it's time to close the revolving door indefinitely. No response. I've blocked his number. It was hard. He was my last connection to my late friend, but it had to be done.

I thought it was over and then...

One of his friends then verbally attacked me a week after the funeral. Completely out of nowhere a guy I haven't seen or spoken to in 6 years messaged me telling me to never speak to T again and that I'm a narcissist, a pathological liar, a fake, a bitch and that I've caused enough damage. He told me the person that had passed never liked me, and that I don't deserve to grieve. He then blocked me everywhere so I couldn't respond or defend myself. I was shaking after this. I hardly know this guy. 

Turns out T spoke to him at the wake and told him god knows what, which led to his verbal attack. 

So I took the time, got myself into therapy and began to make peace with this and take my power back.

He is someone who is extremely popular, extremely wealthy and has many friends. From my knowledge he treats his friends and partners well, it's just me he wipes his feet on (not anymore though!)

What advice would you recommend?

**TDLR:** After 8 long years, I finally kicked an abusive criminal out of my life. Feels good.

Thanks for reading if you got the far!"
"I (26F) am an extremely emotional, empathetic person - my boyfriend (28M) is the complete opposite. Since we’ve moved in together, it’s been causing problems and I don’t know what to do. My boyfriend and I had been together for about 1.5 years before we moved in together. On our first date we talked about our strengths/weaknesses and he commented that he is not a particularly empathetic person, and I joked that I am probably the most empathetic person I know.

We have grown up in very different environments - I come from a family with a lot of mental health problems and have a sibling with autism. My upbringing has demanded a high level of emotional intelligence. My family always talk about their feelings and we NEVER sweep anything under the rug - it always gets spoken about, worked through and dealt with.

My boyfriend, by contrast, has grown up in a family of 3 boys. It was all about sport, being tough, masculine. Even from knowing his family I can see that they deal with things very differently to my family when they argue - a lot of things are said behind backs, no one says what they mean, things get swept under the rug.

Aside from our polar opposite empathy levels, we get along like a house on fire - we make each other laugh, we have so much fun together, I adore him and his work ethic and I love that he makes me want to be a better person. I’ve never felt love until him.

We moved in together about a year ago now, and our different communication styles when it comes to disagreements are causing problems.

- he will be visibly upset/annoyed and when I ask him what is wrong he’ll say “nothing” but act sullen/give me the cold shoulder for HOURS. This drives me INSANE as multiple times he has admitted later on that he was annoyed, and tells me what it was about.

- if I tell him I am upset/angry/anxious/insert any negative emotion here, his response is “Don’t be ______” and that’s it. He’ll then go and do his own thing, I think uncomfortable with/not sure how to handle my emotions.

- when I am feeling depressed (which doesn’t happen too often anymore), I feel as though he is judging me for sleeping in late, not eating well, not exercising etc.

- I’ve explained to him multiple times how I would like to be supported when I feel depressed as he said he gets annoyed because he doesn’t know how to help. He still never does the things I ask though, or he does them in a joking way.

- I had a termination at the beginning of the year. It was a hard decision and I have felt incredibly guilty about it since it happened. I told him how I was feeling a few weeks ago and he didn’t offer me any support.


I really want him to be the one - but I am tired of our arguments turning into day-long games of “who is going to talk to the other first” because I’m tired of trying to communicate with an emotional brick, I’m tired of bursting into tears when he leaves the room because I know my emotions make him uncomfortable, I’m tired of feeling a bit alone.

Some things I am considering:
- having a break for a week or two
- suggesting counselling for us both
- suggesting counselling for him?

If you were me, what would you do?"
"I (19F) have become a middleman between my parents (51F and 53M) and sister (16F) My household has been under a lot of stress lately, and I'm stuck in the middle of it and I don't know how to play out my next actions.

My sister and I have a weird relationship. We were pretty close as kids, but pre-teen and teen years we went the total opposite. Our personalities clash. She has a severe attitude and can be really, really mean. For the last few years, her bad attitude has caused severe issues at school with her friends (always in some kind of drama) and teachers (calling my parents concerned about the way she's acting). All while I was in high school, we didn't get along in any capacity.

However, over the last 6 months, we've somehow gotten to a point where we're civil. This has included her admitting to me her wild party habits. Over the last few months she has admitted to me she is a constant party drug user. The things she tells me she does... it's beyond basic teen experimentation, it's dangerous.

A few months ago, my mum was washing her clothes and found an empty MDMA capsule in her back pocket. My sister cried, vehemently denied it was hers, and said she thinks some creepy guys at the party slipped it into her pocket. My parents believed her. She later confided in me that it was her drug which she had taken.

About a week ago, my mum found a device in her schoolbag which is used for doing nangs, as well as cigarettes. My mum is devastated (all our lives been extremely anti drug), and has been physically sick over this all week. It's tearing her apart. The drug use combined with her bad behaviour (both at school and towards my parents themselves) is causing just a massive rift, and they want to take action.

This is where my middleman position comes in. My parents know my sister tells me things and want to know what she tells me. My sister wants to me to tell her what my parents know about her and if they're gonna confront her, etc. I'm stuck, because I don't want to be a snitch, but I also know what my sister is dangerous - what if I should have said something but never did?

At this point, all I did was confirm their suspicions that the original MDMA capsule was in fact hers, and that the nang cracker was hers and she uses them at parties. I haven't told them about any of the other drug use, only things they have physical evidence on.

I'm stuck. I hate seeing my mum so upset, and my household is ripping apart. I don't know what to say, who to talk to, how to act. I don't even know if I've done the right things thus far. Any advice is appreciated on how I should go about this situation. How should I proceed with the information I have?"
"My ex call me to cheat My ex called me out of the blue. 

I answered. He told me the girl he left me for was no longer together. 

Fast forward to four hours...
He tells me he loves me. Misses me and wants to me to come back to Cali out in August. I agree even make plans. 

We end up having phone sex. 

 he hangs up on me immediately after and blocks me. I finally go the girls page he was seeing.  And see a ring 💍 with his name. 


I asked him several times if he was single. He assure me several times he's single. He told me the sex was not the same. He has really missed our connection and sex. 

I just found their registry... they're getting married in August. 

Should I tell his soon to be wife? Or do I just move on again?"
"My (31F) little sister (23F) is a heroin addict and won’t stop asking people for money TL:DR basically in the title. 

My little sister has become an addict in the last two years and they’ve been absolute hell. I became her legal guardian when she was 16 after our mom died. She started using two years ago and after she overdosed the second time and ran (she literally was DEAD, we have to give her CPR and narcan to revive her) we called the cops and she went to jail for two months. She went to rehab, met another addict, started using again. She was SO bad the next time I saw her that she was in the bathroom every hour for 30 mins that my niece had to call me thinking she was dead. I was out for a walk with my nephew and her girlfriends son at the time. The girlfriend was in jail. Anyway I told her ex that she was at my house and what was going on and he had a hard on for getting her locked up so the cops showed up a few minutes later. Took her to jail after she spent ten mins in the bathroom using up the rest of her stuff. 

The point of this post is, she is out of jail for the second time. Still with the girl she was with when she went in (I fostered her son for a few weeks until the mom was released). She keeps messaging EVERYONE on Facebook and Instagram for money! She lived with me until a couple of months before she was in jail the second time. I just don’t know what to do any more. I’m sorry I had a couple of glasses of wine. This is my little sister whom I love so deeply and I just want her back. I guess I’m a bit desperate and askin for any advice you can give me. Thank you. I apologize for this not being a well formatted or properly grammered post. Basically people keep messaging me and telling me what she’s doing under the suspicion that she’s an addict, I basically just want to make a Facebook post saying “don’t give her any money!” I enabled her long enough and it only dug a deeper hole. I’m just lost. Thanks for reading my rant event if you don’t give advice. Love you all."
"'Ex' Wife Cheating w/ Married Man (sexting) Tell His Wife?? Need some advice. I'll give some backstory but my question isn't so much about that as it is the other person's relationship.  But I welcome all comments. 

Together with my wife 10 years. Married 7. Have a 4 year old. My wife informed me in March she wanted a divorce. Found out a week later she was at minimum cheating emotionally with another man. (A long time friend of hers who even came to our wedding)  She admitted this much and did visit him in person multiple times. But swears there was nothing physical. 

So I first discovered this when I checked her phone because some stories and answers weren't lining up when we were discussing divorce that first week. She changed her phone password when I confronted her but I created a backdoor to still see stuff as we were discussing potential therapy/counseling together. Dont care rather that was wrong invasion of privacy whatever. It's done. 

So she said no to counseling so we're officially done. Now working on custody and everything. 

Well, I had no reason to but I snooped on her phone this morning because shes been on it constantly the last week. Ignoring our child because just constantly staring at it. Staying up until 3-4am every night(our son wakes up at 630am daily and I work from home full time so she used to get up with him not so much this past week).  I was curious what was new for her and snooped. 

Turns out she's been messaging a guy a lot. Sexting. Sending nudes back and forth. Face timing for mutual masturbation. And talking about when they will get together for a fuck weekend. 

None of that would matter since she's said we're done and not gonna save our marriage. Fine. Though I still love her. I cant force her to love me. 

The issue and dilemma is this guy. Married for around 2 years. Has a 4 month old daughter and wife posting happy family pics of them all. 

I dont know what's going on with my soon to be ex wife. This isn't who she was. I would have never thought her capable of these things. So I'm totally floored at this. 
But my question is. Should I send these sexting screenshots to this guys wife?  On one hand I feel she has the right to know. On the other is it really my business?

Also, sending them completely complicates my shit. Right now we're amicably working on a split and custody arrangement. She'll know I sent them so it's going to make my divorce way harder. And our custody could turn into a fight while we currently arent even needing lawyers. 

Advice, ideas, suggestions?  All welcome."
"this is probably a lot tamer than other posts on here, but i really want to show my SO i appreciate them more. any advice? we’ve been together over a year and a half, and if i’m being honest, i have a bad habit of under-appreciating them. they go above and beyond for me, meanwhile i’m often down and depressed or dysphoric, sometimes coming off as if i don’t love them like i truly do. 

i think i’ve become too complacent in my time in this relationship. they’ve just become such a natural part of my life, i forgot how much they really mean to me, and how lucky i am to have them. but i have no idea how to show it!

i already tell them how i feel with words, in terms of how much i love them and really am glad they’re in my life, but i feel the want/need to do so much more! i want to sweep them off their feet all over again, go above and beyond to make them see just how amazing and loved they are. 

i’m tempted to do something like fix their car’s AC or get them some expensive thing they want/need but i know they’d never spend their own money on, if that makes sense. problem is they can’t “legally” own the car (don’t turn 18 till november) so they worry their dad will just take it and sell it for profit if we put money into it (unfortunately their dad kinda sucks). but we live in the desert, it’s like 110 outside during the day! so even though it’d be a decent amount of money (maybe $400) it’s tempting- esp cause they want to get a job over this summer. and besides that, i have no ideas on how else to improve their life and make them happier... what to get them, etc.. 

that said, this is really important to me! if anyone had any ideas how i can make them happier and go out of my way for them like they do for me, i’d really appreciate it

TLDR; in a long term relationship and i’ve grown used to my SO to the point i forget to do nice things for them, but i really want to change that and show them how much i care/ make them feel loved. could use advice!"
"Is a partner continuing to lie about one thing usually mean they are lying about other things too? I (F19) have been with my boyfriend (M20) for almost. Within the last year he has started smoking weed a lot more. I don’t smoke because I don’t enjoy it at all but for the most part I didn’t care that he did it once and a while. In the fall he started smoking almost every day though and I became uncomfortable with the amounts he was smoking and was concerned. I asked him to cut back and he said he would only do it on the weekends because he agreed with me that it was getting out of control. He fell back on his word multiple times during this time which caused arguments between us. 

At the end of December he moved away for an internship and we were long distance. In early January it finally got to a point where he said he was going to quit after he finished his dab pens last cartridge and only use on the weekend. He agreed it was affecting his life negatively and was willing to start cutting back drastically. I found out he was still smoking and basically just lied to me about his use. I told him if he continues lying about this that I am not going to be staying with him since he clearly doesn’t respect me or what makes me uncomfortable. 

Last week he went out of town to pack up his other house that he was moving out of. I asked him if he was planning on smoking which he said No and promised me he wasn’t going to get high and would only smoke cigars with his friends. I said okay and had no problem with it. Last night I face-timed him and he answered and was obviously high. I asked him if he had been smoking to which he kept denying and called me annoying and hung up. It was extremely rude and defensive. I texted him asking him to be honest with me and he said he wasn’t talking about it right now. I told him that it is really upsetting that he will continue to lie about this to me especially when he knows it makes me uncomfortable and seems to be in agreement that it isn’t good to be doing constantly. He responded with “I’m sorry”, but he says that every single time. He hasn’t reached out to me since then because I think he’s used to me just accepting his “sorry” every time I catch him lying but this time I’m not. 

It has me thinking though, if he’s comfortable with lying to me over and over and something he can clearly control and seems to agree with, is it likely he is lying about other things? He was my first serious boyfriend and it seems like he doesn’t care about us staying together even since he hasn’t even texted me or asked to talk since then. I don’t know what to do.. I feel really upset about the whole situation and would really appreciate some advice."
"Husband told me to have a abortion. Me 29f.  him 40m. Baby 4month m 
Relationship 6 years. 


I am currently pregnant maybe a month. 
My husband came home at 3am instead of walking he had to stomp and wake the baby 
I asked him are you going to get him? He's not crying he says. Grabs his bong and weed and runs away to get high. As he's going to the door he yells 'you better have a abortion because I don't want to deal with this again' 

He has said this to me before when I was first pregnant that ended in a miscarriage. Then he said it again on my second pregnancy that ended in a still birth. 

So do I divorce or try to make a man baby understand he's not number one anymore?"
"A traveler suggested 10k$ to my[25M] gf[22F] for hang out for a week and likely have sex with her. I don't know how to react. A German Traveler who's stuck in Iran for a while because of the pandemic lockdown has been sending weird messages to my gf. She says she's not answering his messages. He has asked to stay with her and bang. 
This guy has messaged other girls too, for example my cousin; with the same messages.
My gf lives in a different city from mine and I haven't visited her for almost 3 months because of virus. 
She talks about that weird guy every time despite the fact that I don't like it. She agrees that he is inappropriate, rude and disrespectful but also mentioned that he is handsome. I recommended her to block him but she says she's curious to know what kind of a person he is. She had told me before that she can't stop being attracted to ""blue-eyed north European men"". 
She is great, honest and educated girl and I love her but her refusal to block or at least unfollow that guy makes me nervous, worried, and anxious and insecure. I feel she's been behaving differently to me since last week (since the guy started sending messages)
I don't know how exactly I should behave with her on this issue."
"My husband is obsessed with bikini coffee shops. *** I posted this a while back in AITA and my post was removed claiming I’m clearly not the asshole and they want posts that will cause more of an argument for both sides. I really want to know if this behavior is normal so I’m reposting and hoping to hear honest thoughts from a variety of people ***

Long story short my husband no longer masturbates to porn. He masturbates to bikini coffee shop girls. I’ve tried to make excuses and act like it’s normal but just can’t anymore. 

So my biggest thing about this is that with porn you look at it, get turned on, get your rocks off then go about your day and most importantly you will probably never come into contact with anyone you get off to while watching porn. With these coffee shops the girls are actually accessible. They live in your neighborhood and flirt with you for tips. I’ve ran into them at stores and have mutual friends with them. Most of the girls seem to be under 21 and my husband follows them ALL on Instagram and then masturbates to their photos. He claims all guys do this sort of thing and it’s normal. (I mention the under 21 because my husband is on his way to 40 now so if he’s there flirting with a girl that’s 18 he’s almost 20 years older than her)

I personally feel offended knowing that my husband spends hours a day on Instagram getting turned on then tries to approach me for sex. When I say offended I should also mention that during sex his dick has consistently gone limp inside me which I feel is connected to him being over stimulated every day. Like I mentioned before I don’t mind porn and I get that men like visual stimulation but he is looking at local girls 4/5 daily. No breaks. 

I have never been someone to hold back sex in my relationships but I’m to the point to where I’m not interested let alone turned on to have sex when it feels like he’s just using me to have something to stick his dick into just to satisfy his own needs. Early on when he started going to these places on a regular basis he received a phone number from one of the girls. He claims it was when we had split up for a bit. When he received the phone number he would text her, ask her out, wished her a happy birthday and never got a response from her. She would only respond to texts asking when she was working next. That makes me think she had no physical interest in him but was only interested in him coming to see her at work where he tips and the girls make money. I don’t knock how females grab the bag but if you already work in your underwear why do you need to give your phone number out as well not knowing if it’s a married man or not?

Anytime I bring up my issues with that I’m told that I’m controlling, not letting him do what ALL guys do. I realize it’s common for guys to look at other women and I realize watching porn is normal for many people. But like I said earlier I feel like this is different than porn because he can access these girls in person anytime and he’s clearly getting off on being able to flirt in person with girls he masturbates to.

So am I overreacting? Is this really something that all guys do all the time?"
"My BFs dog he grew up with is in a critical condition in another country. How can I support him? My BF loves his dog very dearly, and always told me if something were happen to his elderly dog, he would jump to the first plane to be with him. However due to quarantine he cannot do that now.  


I want to be there for him and support him anyway I can (We are isolating together). However I am not really the best grief-supporter, since I am a person who strongly prefers to be left alone when feeling sad, but he is not the same.  


How can I make this situation more comfortable for him and show him my support?"
"23 year old girlfriend staying the night at guys houses I have been dating my 23 three year old gf for a little over 3 months, I’m 31. For the last 6 weeks it has been pretty rocky. She has been laid off due to the coronavirus and went home where she stayed the night at multiple guy friends houses. She apparently has lots of male friends and this is normal for her. The last 7 weeks she has had her friend stay with her who is also laid off whom is a stripper back where my gf moved from. My gfs friend has a guy she’s been sleeping with and the two of them will all hangout together and go to his house and also hangout with his other male roommate. They always drink and she stays the night there as well. I’m not very comfortable with all this behavior and have bad experiences in the past with it with previous gfs. I was cheated on when I was really young. To add to the dilemma we live 2 hours away so I may see her once a week. Or once every two weeks and she’s doing this almost every other day. I’m not used to any of this stuff anymore and haven’t dealt with it in a long time. We have discussed it before how anxious I get. I want to try and be understanding because this behavior seems normal to her and she’s normally honest if I ask and says she’s sleeping on the couch. But sometimes she won’t text me all night. I know I’m probably asking for trouble dating someone so much younger than me so I don’t want any advice when it comes to that. And when we first started dating none of this was happening so it caught me off guard. I understand she has a lot of down time and just moved to the area so she doesn’t have any female friends her. So I’m trying to understand how’s she coping with not being able to work."
"I(20F) cant forgive my friends for protecting my cheating boyfriend Ok this sounds kinda petty but please hear me out.

I had a nice group of friends in high school, and a boyfriend, and life was pretty good. Over time the guy turned out to be a bit of a creep - I suspected he was cheating on me, even though he repeatedly denied it, and I broke things off before I went to college. Towards the end of the relationship, he admitted to having a ""thing"" for one of my friends.

About a month after I (finally) broke things off, my friends decided to tell me that they knew he'd been cheating pretty much the whole time, by sending suggestive/sexual things on instagram and whats app to multiple girls. They also produced a series of whats app mesages between him and the friend he had a ""thing"" for, where he again said a bunch of weird things about her body etc. it sounds like it should be gross for her, but she never told him to stop in the messages which i could understand if she was setting a honeytrap for him so they could have proof and tell me - except this only came out after wed broke up. it also came out that they had decided NOT to share this info with me multiple times to give him more ""chances"".

I felt disgusted about it then, and still do now. Why not tell me? why not tell HIM to stop? to make things worse, the whole thing gets treated as a kind of high school ""Drama"", rather then something that really hurt me, if that makes sense. they laugh about him and the whats app messages get quoted at most off our meet ups as some sort of funny story. No one seems to think the friend he was messaging did anything wrong by not telling him to stop.

I feel so petty but I am finding it hard to let it go. it hurts to know that they dissregarded my feelings like this. I guess im just looking for some validation that im not being crazy."
"[ Relationships ] Is it unreasonable that I don’t want my boyfriends dog sleeping with me? 
My boyfriends dog is always in our room, even when we’re having sex. There is no dog free zone. I know as dog lovers it might seem odd that I need space to myself. I enjoy dogs but have boundaries. I’m considering in our new place that I get my own room so he can sleep with his dog and I can sleep in peace. My boyfriend also feels that sleeping is important for bonding but I can’t relax. My sleep is seriously being affected. So I lay there away until her wakes up. He leaves for work around 8:30 so once he’s gone I leave the dog in the bed ( it was her before it was mine ) then I go sleep in the office chair for a few hours. I think. Sometimes I take allergy meds to knock me out for a few hours but I always wake up drowsy. The lack of sleep is really physically and mentally affecting me, so I’m asking for advice.

My boyfriend has had the dog for 6 years now ( before we met and I’m not trying to compete or challenge the fact that a dog lovers dog will always be more important than their partner). Our current living situation is his place and so his rules, which I don’t fight, ever. But we’re going to be moving somewhere new soon.

The dog makes licking sounds 24/7 and I can’t sleep. I know dog lovers don’t care but I literally can’t sleep. She is constantly moving. She likes to get under the covers and lick me and I prefer to sleep naked but can’t. I don’t want to be touched by anyone but my boyfriend. I can’t initiate sex randomly because she is cuddling with my partner . I don’t feel like I should be forced to wear clothes, head phones and share my bed in my own home. 

I am not asking for the dog to be rehoused. Please be kind and no we are not breaking up.

I just want advice."
"He told me he doesnt find me attractive after just two months of dating We started our relationship a week before all of this nonsense when the Corona pandemic happened. We decided to continue dating and seeing each other. I would go to his house every week and spend about 2 or 3 days with him.  During the pandemic he lost his job and I couldnt go to my University.  So we had all the time in the world to text, call and see each other. I thought that things were going great between us. I was feeling safe, every day he would show me that he cares about me. He would tell me that he misses me, that he cant wait to see me again, how he feels totally comfortable with me.   He would talk to me about our future travels after the pandemic ends. Last week he asked me to come over and spend 5 days with him. I of course decided to go because I really like spending time with him, so I was very excited about this. I felt really good during those five days that we spent together. I was relaxed, felt safe, but when those five days ended I really needed some space for myself. I felt like we were together all the time and I needed to chill a bit. A day after I came home i noticed that he was ignoring me. I felt like something just wasnt right. That night he called me and broke up with me. Just like that, out of the blue. I was very confused and I felt this uncomfortable pain in my chest. He told me he was thinking about this for a month but that he really tried his best and wanted this to work between us. He told me he doesnt find me attractive anymore, that he craves sex-appeal that I do not have, and that he feels like he has to teach me how to behave in a relationship, to teach me what to do in bed (i lost my virginity to him and it was all very new for me and it was painfull at times). I felt very confused because i tought we really connected. He really opened up to me, and I did the same. We decided to give each other some space and work on ourselves. 

This hurts me deeply and I would like to know what should I do next. Is there anything there, should I try to get back together with him or that would be a bad idea? Did this happen because of the pandemic or there never was anything there to begin with?"
"My ""straight"" &amp; married best friend (26M) continues to sext me (28M) Hey everyone. I've been going through a real hard time with this one, so I'd appreciate any input you all can give. For starters, I met my best friend in college years ago where we hit it off and became really close. We were practically inseparable in college and even afterwords.

Back in college, he didn't know I was gay at first, but one night when he happened to sleep on my bed because it was ""more comfortable"" than his, somehow we ended up kissing each other and eventually, it became a pretty sexual relationship for years. We were still best friends and would hang out even after college, but a decent amount of time, there was sex involved. If we're being specific here, anal only happened once, so our relationship was mostly oral and all that. He often calls me ""daddy"" and says he wants to be dominated and would fantasize about that, but sometimes we'd switch that role too. I know he watches gay porn, but he may also watch straight porn. And one weird thing is, he often flip flops between saying he's gay to then saying he's bisexual to then saying he's not gay at all or is only ""gay for \[me\]"" and, to this day, that's really confused me. He has told me he loves me many times before, but I know we were never a couple. We never acted like one outside of sex except for a few times, and he'd say things like ""We  love each other so much and show our love to each other this way"" or that we were FWBs.

Anyways, a couple years ago, he moved across the country and I've only been able to go hang out with him there once, but even when I did go there, it was real sexual between us in addition to hanging out / having a good time otherwise as friends. But even before I visited, we sexted pretty regularly with each other, using iMessage, Snapchat, FaceTime, phone calls, etc. We often reminisce about our old times together or fantasize new things. Later that same month when I came back home, he told me he met a girl online from some place far away and was now in the talking phase of that relationship.

I was bummed of course, because even though we weren't a couple and I knew he'd always planned on marrying a girl and settling down one day, part of me really loved him and loved what we had. But I accepted it and figured it was the end and that that was fine. I'd be fine. But throughout that online relationship with that girl, he'd still sext me throughout. It may have gone down somewhat, but it still happened often enough and the same way as before. And I hate myself for being weak, but I would give in even though there were times I'd rebuff his advances and ignore his calls, pretending to be asleep or something. Eventually he got engaged to this girl and he really seems crazy about her and happy. I tried even more to stay away from the sexting. But a year ago, he actually got offended and sad, and I told him straight up that it just felt different now that he was engaged and no longer felt right to me. I also told him I felt jealous, and he told me that he still loves me and always has/always will, and that when he gets married, this will be over, but for now, ""Why can't we enjoy and keep doing what we've been doing until then?""

I didn't follow that logic, but like I said, I was weak and I'd say maybe half the time I'd give in and the other half, I'd manage to avoid it by saying I was busy or not answering his calls till the next day or something. Even when he got married, I had a thought that I don't really believe he'll stop sexting me or quit the sexual side of our relationship. I thought, if anything, he'll stay away a year but fall back into it. Btw, his wife knows I'm his closest/best friend, but she doesn't know about the sex or even his supposed gay side.

It took less than 2 months post-marriage and he sexted me yesterday. And it was pretty explicit too, like he asked me things like if he visited and slept in the same room as me, would I be able to resist if this and that, and that he'd want me to dominate him. We reminisced about sexual memories. And then he also FaceTimed me and was being pretty X-rated about it with his wife asleep in the next room. I'm stupid and weak, so of course I fell into it and didn't even resist it this time. And now, I do feel really guilty about it knowing that his wife was literally right there. And I need some help in how I can be strong and not let it happen again.

Any advice on what to do? I don't even understand him, so if someone else has been in a similar situation or knows what he's doing, can someone please explain this to me? I still care about him and see him as my closest friend, but ideally, I'd like that sex side of our relationship to end. I miss that side of us of course, and I do reminisce about it a lot, but with him being married now, I can't let it go on but what do I do? Also, is this considered cheating on his wife or what?!"
"Should I be worried &amp; offended? So me and my partner were sleep, its 12:30Am and his phone just start vibrating under MY pillow. Its a facebook call from one of his female friends, I ignore the first 2 times it rang because when I tried to wake him up he wouldn’t budge. Cool. 3rd time it rang I'm trying to get him up, he gets up dazed of course just staring at it confused, so I just slide it open while he held it, (Sounded like a
Butt dail) mind you I'm not mad or anything I'm just wanting to hear the voice on the other side to see if it was an accident and because he was just staring at the screen. He whips his neck around and says “why did you answer it... what made you do that?” (because I dont go through his phone at all). Im like wtf you asking me that for like I'm snooping, he’s like its the principle, its not your property dont touch it, its none of your business. Im trying to explain to him I woke up just as confused so I just answered the phone out if instant curiosity, it was no ill intent. He gets pissed because he thinks I'm not “taking responsibility for being wrong”. Whatever. But I'm so confused why he came at me like I'm a random or something like he going hard over his phone. I know its wrong to snoop through phones thats why I dont do it. Im just really thrown off at his reaction. I felt it was a bit much for my actual intentions behind what I did off of a whim. 

I feel like a child who has been scolded."
"I feel like my bf and his family crossed a line but I also just might be over emotional right now My bf is great, whenever I’m upset he wants me to tell him what’s wrong and he doesn’t just dismiss my feelings he always acknowledged and fixed whatever it was that was upsetting me. He goes out of his way to help people, he’s hard working and has goals, he’s also a dick. He’s said off handed comments to me in the past but I chalked it up to him being 19 and this being his first relationship (I’m 21). He’s as white as you can be and I have the slightest amount of Mexican in me, the only feature I have is tan skin and it’s not even a dark tan. Yesterday I met his uncle and his uncles family, I walked in the room and they all stared at me for a moment after I was introduced (I’m not ugly by any means) and his uncle then shook my hand we then all went outside to look at his cousins car and his uncle then told the story how he asked his sons Mexican friend if he could fit in the trunk (because I guess that’s a Mexican thing) and my lovely bf immediately pointed out that I was Mexican and not so they would stop just so they would know and laugh or whatever. So we go back inside and EVEY SINGLE time his uncle or anyone in his family talks to me it’s to reference me being Mexican. I don’t remember everything they said because I was embarrassed and mad but one was you should plant some crops for her this summer and they asked if I was a jumper a swimmer or a runner then they said I was a runner and I ran across the boarder and if a Mexican can run jump or swim they’re here. Alls my bf did was laugh and I ended up leaving early. I’m not a sensitive person I don’t mind being teased I get that that’s life and people are going to make jokes but I’m upset by last night and idk if it’s for a valid reason or because I’ve been emotional for some reason recently. My bf knew they were being rude and instead of just straight up apologizing he said he was sorry if his family annoyed me and then proceeded to keep asking what was wrong and then offered to buy me a pair of shoes all through text last night. Today he continued to ask what was wrong and tried calling me so I just flat out said you were a dick and your family was kinda rude and he acknowledged his family being assholes and said yeah I know I’m sorry I kinda went off on them when you left and as for me being a dick that was uncalled for and I’m sorry. I don’t mind jokes, I make jokes I’m really not a sensitive person at all but there’s making jokes and just flat out being rude and I don’t tolerate rude people. Him, his family, and friends are all very white and ignorant they’ve ALL said things about different kinds of people (and me) that I chalked up to jokes and I don’t think they are actually racist just very ignorant but last night my feelings were hurt. What do you think about all this and what would you do? I don’t want overly sensitive response or the responses just telling me to dump him. I’m not sure if I’m just being over emotional. He’s asking if I’m going to leave him and I’m thinking of saying I think you would be happier and your family would be more comfortable with a white girlfriend."
"found out my fiancé (M24) is paying cam girls Hi i’m new to reddit! and this is my first post

So i recently found out my fiancé is been paying cam girls on some pornoo sites and i didn’t even know about it....We had a huge argument about porn how im not comfortable him watching porn but we talked and im okay with it now. 

He watches porn when im not around but he never told me he was paying cam girls and this is a shocker to me. 

I don’t know what to do. i feel betrayed and hurt. Any advices? :( is this normal for guys to pay cam girls even when they’re in a relationship???"
"I (f21) feel disgusted by the thought of any father-daughter relationship because of my dad (m47) I'll try to keep it short. Me (21) and my dad (47) started having trouble with each other since I was 12 or 13 years old. He never opened up about anything, he put me down all the time, I was never good enough for anything. When he drove me to school (1 hour drive), we would argue and usually I would end up crying because of his yelling. He yelled all the time - because I got one bad grade (I was a good student overall), because I didn't empty the dishwasher in 2 seconds or simply because I forgot my mittens when going to school.

He also has a drinking problem. He would come back early in the morning from a night out a few times a week. One time, when he got back late at night and I was in my nightwear, he told me ""oh, you look sexy"" with a drunk smirk on his face. I was 13.
There was also a time, when he came into my room with a few friends. They were all drunk, and in my room I have these weird looking lamps. My dad showed them to his friends and talked about them looking like nipples while I was half asleep.

My mom now is getting a divorce. She told me, that she had found condoms in his pocket multiple times after a night out, although she and dad never used any. She also confided in me how he has forced himself on her multiple times, drunk or not.

For the past year I cannot look at my father, I feel disgusted. I feel like I can't wear shorts, shorter dresses or skirts, because I'm afraid I will look ""sexy"". I also have a boyfriend, and I'm scared to have a daughter - I can't imagine my boyfriend and possible future daughter having any kind of physical contact, it makes me sick. I trust him with my life, but it seems that I'm just disgusted by any kind of father-daughter relationship right now.

So what should I do, how can I get past it? Or am I overreacting? I honestly don't know anymore.

P. S. sorry for my English, it's not my first language. Thanks!

EDIT: some clarification: my dad has never made any physical advancements towards me, it was always only verbal. And I have spoken about it with my boyfriend a lot, he's very understanding and helpful.
I moved out when I was 18, now I'm living with my mom and sister (12), and because of her I can't stop all contact with my dad, he picks her up regularly and it seems he was always a saint with her."
"My partner (21)M doesn't find me (22)F attractive anymore. Over the past couple of weeks my bf doesnt want to have sex with me or even cuddle with me. I've noticed him check out other women who look the opposite to what I look like. I'm not sure if he finds me attractive anymore.

I'm on the chubby side with dark thick hair, and my boyfriend checks out tall blonde European looking women. He told me when we first started going out 5 years ago that hes into tall blonde women. I've mentioned to him does he find me unappealing because of my weight, but he wont directly tell me. I've gained weight through my mental health and having a lack of self discipline. This has really affected my confidents, and I feel like I have no leg to stand on. Does anyone have any advice?"
"Last week, friend (40m) told me (40f) he is divorcing his terminally ill wife(40f), and leaving her with the kids (2 boys - 8 &amp; 6) in the middle of the corona pandemic. He told me this because I run a niche FB group of around 200+ people across the US and Canada, of which he is a member.  Despite having no kids myself, I am looked upon as somewhat of the group mother figure, I think.  I know his wife, though she is not in the group so we don't talk nearly as much.  She has been sick with cancer for 4 years already, there is nothing they can do for her but make her comfortable.

Anyway, he lives in my state, and through the group, we've often socialised together IRL.  He knows I have been divorced and probably wanted support, which I gave him via text message - telling him he could reach out to me whenever he wanted, and discussing practical things like getting therapy for the kids.  He's been sending me photos of himself drunk and crying, and telling me how his kids have already told him they hate him.  I feel absolutely devastated for his wife, but I can see it's been hard for him taking care of her and the kids, so I was trying my best to be supportive to him as I wasn't sure who else he had to turn to.

Today, he dropped the bombshell that he has moved in with his mistress.  Now, when any of my other friends have told me about having affairs / cheating, I have gone full Judgey McJudgerson and blocked them from my life.  My Dad cheated on my Mam, and I absolutely don't have time for anyone who partakes in that type of shit.  I haven't responded since he told me, but he has continued to write to me to defend his actions - ""she wasn't the reason I asked for a divorce"" type stuff.  Alrighty then.

It's not so easy for me to block this sleazeball from my life being as he's in my group, and he hasn't done anything directly harmful to me or the other group members that's worthy of blocking.  But I don't know how to respond to the text messages after telling him I'd be supportive.  Our group has been having weekly zoom calls since the pandemic started, and I'm sure other people will sense a frostiness between us because I can't contain my disgust with him.  Some of the local group members are also my best friends, who I would normally turn to for relationship advice, but I feel I can't talk to them about this because I shouldn't be discussing his private business with his friends, even though they are my friends too.

My question is - how would you guys deal with this situation?  And how do I respond to the text messages he is sending me defending himself, when this actions have made me feel nauseous?  Can I discuss this and get support from my best friends, who also happen to be other group members / his friends?  How do I stop being so judgemental and carry on as normal in the group setting, when it's something that I normally wouldn't put up with?

Thank you in advance for any advice you might have.  I know I shouldn't be so wrapped up in this, but I can't stop thinking about his poor wife, and how my Dad leaving for another woman destroyed my Mam.  And to imagine that happening with terminal cancer on top, in the middle of a pandemic?  And to just leave her with the kids?  I can't see how I can treat him normally because of my overwhelming disgust."
"Unsure of whether I like my mother I’m 16 and my dad killed himself 3 years ago over allegations my mother was cheating.

Without going into detail, there was pretty convincing evidence indicating this was happening.

Now I live with my mom and her new partner comes over every second day (the one she was accused of cheating with). I’m sick of faking conversation and acting like I can tolerate this guy, and ever since what happened I’ve seriously questioned my relationship with my mom.

With Mother’s Day coming up, I can’t help but feel like my personality is a facade and any love I had for my mom died with my dad.

Is this normal? I just always see her as the person caused all of this."
"My(33f) gf(31) and I have very different sex drives. What do? We’ve been together almost two years, and the last several months we have sex maybe once or twice a month. I told her at the beginning of the relationship that I had a very high sex drive and it was very important to me in a relationship. She later told me that she essentially faked how much she wanted sex with me in the beginning because she assumed I would want to be intimate less as our relationship matured and it wasn’t novel anymore.

We’ve talked about this endlessly, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I stopped trying to initiate long ago and leave it up to her because she said she felt pressured by me. She needs more verbal reassurances than I do, and I need more physical, but we’re both left feeling empty and unable to feel close and loved.

There are other problems as well, but this one alone seems insurmountable. To clarify, in a relationship I typically enjoy sex on average at least once a day, and she seems content with 2-3 times a month. She’s trying to show interest in me and make me feel loved, but it feels forced, it’s very irregular, and it’s difficult for me to just turn it off and on based on when she’s feeling horny enough to have sex with me.

Masturbation is an issue because she feels insecure and left out, but what else can I do? I don’t want to pressure her for sex, and I’ve even cut way back on how often I practice a little self love because she gets upset with me. Also, I never passive aggressively masturbate in front of her or instead of having sex with her when she’s amenable. She’s insecure about me watching porn (very rare that I do this), particularly straight porn, and seems to be hurt when I don’t feel like having sex with her (it’s usually late at night when I’m tired or I’m just not in the mood). We’ve talked this issue to death, and I love her and want her to be happy, but I’m just dying on the inside. 

Opening the relationship is not an option, and me masturbating in between the times she feels like having sex isn’t a sustainable option. I’ve told her before that we are incompatible in this way, but she always talks me out of ending the relationship. I just don’t feel close to her anymore, despite loving and caring about her, and I find myself unable to give her the verbal affection she needs to feel loved. I’m withdrawn a lot more lately, and we both feel lonely.

TLDR gf and I have very different sex drives and I don’t know how to cope anymore"
"Getting a full body massage So my (34F) bf (31M) goes to massage parlors, he works a very physical job and his back hurts often. I have no problem with this BUT he was just telling me that he has been to some where they massage his balls and dick. He says it's for relaxation, that he doesn't do it to get a hard on or let them finish him off, but this still irks me. He sees no problem with it. He says he's had offers for the ""happy ending"" but always declines. Now I know this, I'm going to feel totally uncomfortable next time he goes. 
Is this normal for massage parlors? Would you consider it crossing the line?"
"I think I'm (27M) starting to have feelings for my cousin (26F), and vice-versa. And I feel super fucked up and disgusted about it. So here's a lot of backstory.

I have this first cousin once-removed, let's call her Bri. She's my mom's first cousin and we've known each other since we were children, over 20 years now. I was never particularly close to her, and she moved to another state (I live in the US) when she was still young. When the aunt who was raising her there was dying of breast cancer around 2005, a bunch of family including myself went there to visit her. There I met some family I had never met before and also I had reconnected with Bri. We were about 11 and 12 at the time I think. After the aunt died, Bri and two of her sisters moved back to my state to live with another aunt near me. Over the next couple of years I saw her from time to time. She would come over to my house to hang out with my mom or we'd go over to my aunt's, but I still never really got close to her. She and her sisters had issues with the family and acted out a lot (they were also teenagers so, you know) so I kind of kept my distance. After a couple of years, they all ran away and the family sort of lost contact with them.

Fast forward to January 2020. I'm now 27 and she's 26. I'm friends with her on Facebook and I've been seeing what kind of life she's had since she ran away. At this point, she's married to a man ten years her senior and had three kids with him. I see a post she made that her youngest daughter, 13 months old, had an accident at home and had to be rushed to the hospital. For some reason, I felt compelled to reach out to her and so I did for the first time in over a decade and found out through my mom what happened. Shortly after, Bri's daughter died.

I found out that a bunch of family was travelling to where she lived for a weekend to attend the memorial service. My immediate family save for my grandma couldn't go because of financial reasons. For some reason, I felt compelled to show up so I shelled out money for a ticket and went with my grandma and aunt to Bri's state for four days to attend the service. There I saw her for the first time since we were teenagers and I met her husband and surviving kids for the first time. Bri felt like she needed to spend time away from her husband and kids to grieve for her lost daughter, as pressures of being a solid wife and mom were overcoming her. I and a few other cousins took her out drinking the night before the memorial and commiserated with her. She and I ended up bonding for the first time in our lives just sharing our personal tragedies. She ended up passing out on one of the couches in the living room at our AirBnB. I ended up getting blackout drunk and passed out in the living room too (it was arranged that I would sleep on the couch anyways). I don't remember what happened afterwards but according to Bri and her sisters, I was apparently ""very nurturing"" towards her and made sure she was okay throughout the night.

The next day we had the memorial and she gave a very touching eulogy that was written as a letter to her daughter and then played ""You Are My Sunshine"" on the violin. Needless to say, there wasn't a dry eye in the church. That night she came over to our AirBnB with her kids and a lot more of us went out drinking again at a bar in town (the kids stayed at the AirBnB with the older relatives). She initially wanted to stay at the AirBnB and told me I should stay too, but I convinced her we should go out with everyone since we were all here for her, so we did. At the bar, I got really drunk and started getting emotional over a recent ex. Bri saw that I was having a hard time, linked her arm in mine, and led me outside. She tried to get me to walk back to the AirBnB with her but I was very opposed to the idea of being the reason Bri had to leave everyone else behind since they all came out for her, so we stayed until everyone was ready to leave.

Back at the AirBnB, we were all drunk and just talking and reminiscing. I was sitting on one of the couches with Bri and her older sister. Bri was laying on her sister and put her leg up on my lap. Eventually, everyone went to bed and Bri just cuddled up right next to me on the couch. Her other sister put a blanket on us and we spent the whole night that way, with her stepkids on the floor in front of us.

The next morning a couple of my cousins talked about how they saw us snuggling together and one teased me by saying we ""looked cute cuddled up like a couple."" It all made me very uncomfortable, but what made me more uncomfortable was the thought that I may actually be developing feelings for Bri.

The time came for me to leave and I gave Bri my number and told her to text or call me for whatever reason. My feelings aside, I felt like I had a duty as a relative to be there for my cousin who was going through a hard time because from experience I know how important it is to be able to talk with someone.

Over the next few months, we started texting each other almost every day and would occasionally play Call of Duty online together. I learned more about her. I learned about her rocky relationship with her husband, that he used to be abusive and would constantly cheat on her, and through years of therapy they were able to achieve a breakthrough and have a more stable relationship. However, after their daughter's death, she said he fell into some old habits, drinking again and verbally abusing her. Even her stepkids wouldn't show her any respect. She told me how she and her husband sleep in separate rooms and that he talks to her only a few times a week. In fact, she told me she talks to me more than anyone else in her life, more than her husband and sisters, and trusts me with things she doesn't trust anyone else with. Whenever she has a problem, often I'm the only one she feels she can talk to. We both have lamented that we were never closer as kids and she expressed gratitude that I was her family. One time recently we realized we didn't talk to each other for an entire week and I told her that I missed her and she said she missed me too. It all made me feel more guilty that more and more I was harboring romantic feelings for her.

Because of this pandemic crisis, she's been spending most of her days homeschooling her kids and cleaning her house and feels now more than ever the need to take a break from her family. She often talks about visiting family in my state and doing all these things with me like going out to drink, going to a comic book convention, going snowboarding, etc. I similarly cannot go visit her and honestly, at this point all I can think about is seeing her again.

Eventually, I overcame my shame and talked about my feelings to a few trusted close friends. I expressed disgust and shame at my own feelings, especially for someone who is at such a vulnerable time in her life. There's a part of me that wants to be honest and tell her how I feel, but I don't want to ruin what we have and drive her away. Conversely, I'm also just as afraid that she'll actually reciprocate those feelings because I am pessimistic about the road that would lead to. One of my friends told me he believes with certainty that she already decided that she has feelings for me, or else she wouldn't be telling me the things she tells me. And that because of that, he urged me to cut off all contact with her. Part of me thinks he's right, and the selfish part of me can't bear to take that little bit of happiness away from my life.

So right now I'm in sort of limbo, partially due to this pandemic. I can't see her and I don't know what would happen once I'm able to. And I don't want to say anything to her now while we're not face-to-face, but I also have gotten major anxiety over this whole thing. I don't really know what to do or how to feel anymore."
"I (23f, Asian) is currently quarantined with my (20m, American) bf but things just get weirder Ive been dating my bf for 6mths now. I have never met anyone like him before, he’s really different. Things are really amazing between us and Im quarantined together with him due to covid. My bf has always been sweet and caring but ever since lockdown and we only have each other, things just got weirder. He started acting like he is my parent. He’s been giving me all these kid stuff and wants me to play with them, he says he’s into ddlg or whatever that is. Sometimes he insists on feeding me but I dont want that because it feels weird, he even wants to bathe me and dress me up. I believe its okay from time to time but he’s just persistent and most of the time its just creepy. When I’m arguing with him and he gets mad, he tends to “punish” me like locking me up in this room he made for me full of toys and pink stuff and sometimes he even spanks me (I dont feel or view it in a sexual way). I struggle and try hard to get away from his grasp and to talk him out of it but he’s just so strong and won’t listen to me and in the end I just end up being “punished” by him. Sometimes he’s also annoying me and just being an asshole to me. Like for example when he hyped up valentines day and promised that he’d get me something really special only to give me a large empty box with a card inside that said “insert gift here.” He really thought it was hilarious and so did I but I was a bit mad and disappointed too. He’s a huge pervert too and most of the time its inappropriate. He’ll grope me in public in front of people, make perverted jokes or actions out in public and it’s really embarrassing me, I don’t say anything about it usually tho.

How should I go about his behavior toward me? Im not confrontational and I worry about him using me as his kink. I’m deeply in love with him, I just don’t know what to do. Any advice would really help. Thank you."
"My ex kicked me out after he got me pregnant and my family won’t take me back I(19f) used to live with my ex. One night he brought home alcohol and had sex with me when I was drunk. I later found out that I was pregnant and I screamed at him for causing this.

He ended up kicking me out and I’ve been asking my friends and family if I could stay but due to the pandemic everyone said that I can’t. My parents are actually mad at me for allowing this to happen and said that they will never accept me back. I don’t know what to do I need advice."
Husband anger issues I’m just trying to get advice about if what I deal with is normal. We have a newborn and she had colic so she cries a lot. Whenever I ask him to help with her 80% of the time he either calls me lazy or gets angry. Last night she started crying and I asked if he could help and he stood up started cussing and kicked and hit all the furniture against the wall and slammed the door into the wall. We live in a bottom floor apartment so people upstairs definitely heard that and I’m just scared someone would call the cops on us cuz of his outbursts. Is this something that just is what a new parent like goes thru? He’s done this same thing before but it was not as loud. He walked out cussing and saying he doesn’t get sleep (neither do I obviously). He hasn’t had to work much since the covid so it’s not like he’s drained from working.
"My [35f] husband [42m] told me if I don't lose weight, he will start sleeping with other women. My husband and I have been married for 15 years. We met when I was 18 and started dating shortly after. We were always physically active, going on runs together, lifting together. We were a fit couple. After he graduated law school he started working a ton so he worked out in the city and I just kind of stopped.

After our last child, I gained a lot of weight have struggled getting the weight off. My husband didn't say anything about my weight until a year after the baby, and to his credit he tried being delicate. He didn't flat out tell me to lose weight, but he would suggest things like orange theory or soul cycle etc.. He would try to suggest that ""we both"" go on diets etc. 

Well I guess I didn't take the hint because last night in bed I tried to initiate sex. He told me that because of my weight he no longer found me sexually attractive. He said that he wasn't going to leave me for it, but he couldn't have sex with me. He said that if I can't get my weight under control he will have to sleep with other women. 

I talked to my mother about it and she says he's not being unreasonable? This seems so old fashioned. Am I really to accept this arrangement?

EDIT: Sorry I will not consider divorce. We have five children and I will not allow my vanity to break up this family."
"Girlfriend wants to breakup because my brother is having a kid and she doesn't want to be involved. I've just been talking to my girlfriend and she's decided she doesn't want to be with me anymore because my brother has just gotten married and his wife is pregnant. She's saying she doesn't want to ""have to deal with it"" which i don't know what it means.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think this is a reasonable reason for someone to breakup? What should I do? I don't want her to go, obviously."
My gf becomes petty and tries to bait me into responding to her whenever we get into an argument what do i do? So tonight i texted my gf that i wanted to be alone for the night. I wanted some alone time to just relax by myself. Every night we’d ft because it helps her sleep but tonight we didn’t because i told her i wanted to be by myself. Knowing her she must’ve felt hurt so i asked her if she was alright and just said she was and blew me off. Half an hour later she sends me insta posts about being sad and hurt and idk what she expects me to say. Then she texts me and saying all these bad things happening to her and i feel guilty for trying to be alone for a night.
"My Boyfriend has become obsessed with Corona Virus Conspiracy Theories and I Think It’s Getting Unhealthy throwaway for obvious reasons, but pretty much my boyfriend has spent weeks researching corona virus conspiracies, and initially I had no problem with this. At first I thought it was just a funny way to pass the time, and just listened to what he’d tell me and not challenge it because I didn’t think it was an issue. 

But it’s gotten to a point where every conversation revolves around a new theory he’s heard, or how he’s gonna combat whoever is to “blame” for this situation. It’s started to effect our relationship as he’s not sleeping, so I’m not sleeping, we don’t have normal conversations anymore as they all revolve around his theories which makes things very one sided, and I believe that some of the theories he’s buying into encourage behaviours that I simply won’t tolerate (racism, sexism, anti-vax,etc. ) 

I don’t know how to bring this up with him now because I haven’t strongly challenged his opinion on this earlier, so it may be a bit of a shock to him that it’s only coming up now. I also don’t want to force my opinions onto him, but every waking minute of his is spent researching these theories and parroting them back to me and it’s starting to really get to me. 

Please help I have literally no idea how to get through to him, to explain my side of things, or how to just get him to put a limit on the time he spends talking about and researching the topic.  Thanks in advance 

Edit for additional context: we have never fought before this since we’ve started dating, we’re great with communication and usually have no issues. this is pretty much the first big thing to come up which I think makes it even weirder to sort out"
"New Sex Toys from Former ""Suitor"" Its supposedly been 4 months since she received this gift.  I asked her unaccusingly where she got it.  She tells me in text, some guy that was trying to get with her gave it to her.  She is also an alcoholic who has destroyed my property(that I loved) when I wouldn't submit to her demands.

A few texts go by and it clicks in my head.  So I called her and asked her to see the conversations with this man.  She paused and said no. Her tone of voice almost outraged.

It's almost 24 hours later before she finally tells me a story to go with it.  Why didnt she do that in the first place if she wasnt hiding something?

Instead, she says how I ruined her day and blah blah.

Please, leave your thoughts to help me make this tough decision."
"I (33F) finally stood up for myself vs bully sister (30F), familydrama ensued and I feel terrible now My sister and I have had a difficult relationship from the start. She's the type of person that is really convinced of her own superiority. 

She bullies me by making degrading comments about my clothing style, my choices, my way of life. And for the longest time I've allowed her to do that. Involuntary obviously, I just didn't know how to stand up for myself properly. At first I got really angry and upset and thus reacted to every button she pushed in exactly the way she wanted.  If anything it only fueled her bullying. 

  
My parents did not interfere (even though at one point I literally begged them to stop her), which let me to believe that if they thought her behavior was normal than it probably WAS normal and I  deserved it, because I was indeed weird and different than most people. Cue depression. 10+ years of therapy andan autism diagnosis later I worked hard on regaining some self esteem through the years and am able to shrug off most of the backhand comments she still makes. But underneath the surface they still hurt and the fact that no one bothers to stand up for me stings. 

I understand that that's on me. It's my problem that I still let it hurt me, that she still gets to me. I'm working on it, but years of this relentless bullying are hard to shake off. 

Yesterday she was at it again, in the family appgroup (My two sisters and I and our spouses and my parents), it was a tame comment compared to other things she said, but it pushed just the right buttons again. So I told her I didn't want this anymore and she did this to get attention again. She maliciously acknowledged that with smileyfaces and all. 

My mom, fed up with it all, left the group; saying that if this is how her kids behaved she would not be celebrating mother's day any more. 

My husband (46M) then asked my sister if she was happy now and she proceeded to openly attack him; calling him names and all.

No one else reacted, except sister's husband (32M) who said sister was just joking. 

So I calmly and far subtler than I actually felt at that moment told them and the rest of my family that if it's considered normal that I am the butt of every degrading joke and this calling people names is accepted in this familygroup than I'd rather not be in it and left the group. My husband left too.  

I then messaged my parents about not standing up for me in any way and normalizing her bullying. This was dumb and came from emotions, but I was hurt by my mom laying the blame partly on me.

They basically said that they didn't want to pick sides and they still want to see all their grandchildren (my sister's favorite threat, she did it to her in-laws already so she WILL go through with it). 

I understand this reasoning, but it feels as if they already picked a side by enabling her for so long and continue to do so.

My husband says they are not obliged to help me. He believes I should continue working on not getting my buttons pushed so easily and leave them out of it because they are in an impossible position. (For the record he fully supports me otherwise and applauded the way I calmly responded in the appgroup) 

I slightly disagree with that final statement, because I think this is what comes with being a parent. Sure we're adults now, it only means they should've done it sooner. For example at that time I practically begged them to help me. I hope that if one of my kids acts like a total asshole to my other kid I have the balls to go up against them. 

So now here I am with all this pent up anger and disappointment and betrayal. And I'm sick of feeling like a victim and I seriously loathe that I allow myself to feel all these things. I just want to be stronger than this and for a while I thought I was, but she still gets to me obviously and I still feel betrayed by my parents.    

Am I wrong in feeling these emotions and how do I deal with my parents?"
"Heartbreak and How do you trust your own judgement again? I fell for a girl. I fell too hard and too fast. She had recently broken up with her boyfriend and I decided to give my long time crush a shot. All my friends and all her friends thought it was a good idea too. We began texting and kissing after nights out with friends. I’d ask her out to a few dinners from time to time, and she’d say yes, but then something would come up. And I’d always want to give her the benefit of the doubt. I never wanted to be controlling/jealous/prying into her life. I knew she had her reasons and always wanted her to do what she wanted. She would tell me to move on at times, and then tell me to kiss her at times. It was very confusing and I never knew what to do. I wouldn’t kiss her because I wasn’t sure if o knew that’s what she wanted. And I still wanted to be her friend if we weren’t together. She confided in me a lot, which made me feel special. Nobody’s ever really done that with me. My friends began seeing what was going on and hers too. And slowly everyone told me I should be moving on. I heard she spent Valentine’s Day with her ex and it broke me. But then I’d rationalize it and we finally did go to dinner and I was still unsure what was going on. It was a very awkward dinner and she asked me what was going on? I didn’t know what to say, I asked her how she was feeling and she didn’t know what to say. The next day she invited me over for a movie, we watched and it was good. At the end I asked if I could give her a goodbye kiss, she seemed hesitant so I hugged her goodbye. She later texted me saying she would have been okay with a kiss. This was right before ‘quarantine’ started. Her texts became more distant and I knew what was going on. I never wanted to believe it. She ended up going back with her ex. I never wanted to be the guy ‘stealing’ her away from her ex. And I never wanted to be the guy pushing things too far. So I never knew what to do. And now I don’t know when to trust my own judgement really ever moving forward. Idk how to get over that feeling. I’m 26 and never had a real girlfriend. I’ve ‘hooked up’ a lot, always settling. And this seemed like the closest thing to ever being real to me. Idk how to move forward from here. I know I’ve made a lot of mistakes along this torturous journey, and I know she did too. I don’t know/want to play the game of attracting someone. Idk really what I’m expecting from this post, but if anyone has some advice. It would be appreciated."
"How do I (29/F) deal with seeing a reddit post from your partner (39/M of 5 years) that you probably shouldn’t have seen? Now, my partner has told me his reddit username a hundred times because he doesn’t really understand reddit. Like at all. He tells me to go and find his posts and upvote them all the time. I think he thinks it’s like Facebook? I don’t really know. 

But I checked to see what he’s been up to, just out of curiosity... and two hours ago, he answered a question on r/askreddit asking happily married people what it would take for them to leave their SO... and his answer was “winning the lottery. It’s all about the money.”

It’s since been deleted. Not sure if by him or by the person who started the thread... but man. I feel like I got punched. I know I shouldn’t be “checking up on him”.... but shit. Is that all I am to him? Or was he just talking out of his ass? He’s been so distant lately, which was probably part of why I was looking. 

How do I deal with this?"
"Need advice I really want a relationship but every time I meet a guy I get repulsed by his sexual interest in me. I'm not asexual and I think sex is important but I don't understand how it could be a priority over getting to know a person's character and getting a sense of who they are and if we vibe or not. Its really hard to keep dating a person when you see them as shallow, pathetic and desperate and I don't know how to not see a man that way after he expresses sexual interest. How do I change this awful mindset?"
"Should I [22F] tell my boyfriend [23M] about my past sex work? My boyfriend and I have been together for just under a year and we're both very happy together. He's been nothing but supportive and caring towards me and I can honestly say I've fallen in love with him. I don't like hiding things from others and generally do my best to be as open and honest with him as possible, but there's one particular thing that I haven't had the nerve to bring up.

That particular thing is I used to make money throughout college by doing online sex work. I sold custom photos, videos, and voice clips, and would sext or cam with men for a paid amount of time. I would also publicly post (faceless) nude photos on NSFW subreddits to attract customers. The work I did was never physical or in-person.

I stopped being involved in that gig about a month or so before my boyfriend and I started dating and haven't had any sexual contact with anyone other than him. In person, online, business, casual, or otherwise. I have been completely faithful to him alone.

I'm not ashamed of doing what I did. It got me the money to buy essentials, and was flexible enough to not interfere with school. However I'm worried that my boyfriend might be upset if he found out. While part of me thinks it's not his business because it was in the past before we were together, the other half of me feels guilty, like I'm hiding something from him by not mentioning it.

I'm terrified that if he finds out he'll lose respect for me or not want to be with me anymore. I also worry that if I don't tell him myself he might hear about it if anything related to it comes up in conversations with friends of mine (my closest friends are aware of the work I did and supported me), and will then not trust me. Am I overthinking this? Would you be upset to learn a partner was involved in sex work at some time?"
"I feel very lonely in my relationship and I have no idea if its cause of me or my girlfriend So for the past month or so I have been getting increasingly more and more lonely and if we spend time together I feel more lonely. I try and cuddle and she'll push me away and tell me shes in the mood, all the time, sex has got very boring, and I've told her all this and she just said I need time to myself. We arent the most similar people like we have very different perspectives on the world, like religion, politics, race, even ethics. What do you think I should?"
"My (30F) Bf (32) of 8 months just told me he has a 3 month old As the title says my boyfriend of over 8 months has just told me he has a 3 month old daughter to a hook up last year. He is only telling me because the girl messaged his brother last night telling him. He was paying for the baby but taking nothing to do with it apparently. I don’t know how to react, the thing that gets me the most is the selfishness of not taking responsibility of your own child and the lies to conceal it aswell.

I don’t know what to do."
"I’ve (23F) been broken up with my ex (23M) for 2 years. Why do I still think about him (23M) every day? We dated from our freshman year of college, until the middle of our senior year. I realize I grew a lot as a person since our breakup.

My family is 9 hours away and he was my family here in college. I only went home twice a year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Other than that, we were always together here in college.

One day we had an argument and broke up. It’s been like that ever since. 

He’s in a happy relationship with someone better suited for him. He was my best friend so I know him very well, and I can genuinely say they go well together. (Even look alike.) I don’t want him back and I respect his relationship. 

But why do I feel so sad at very random times? 

Every now and then when I’m doing household chores, or going for a run, I find myself thinking about him. Sometimes I start crying in the middle of a long drive and that sucks because I can’t see anything. 

Since the breakup, I physically look more attractive (confidence, self-esteem, self-care). I haven’t been in a serious relationship, but I’ve tried. Just never happened. 

I think it’s weird that I still think of him. I’m moving on with my life, going to graduate school next semester, doing my own thing. But it still hurts and I want this feeling to go away."
"My (17F) boyfriend (19M) admitted to me that he briefly had feelings for another girl - how do I get over this? My (17F) boyfriend (19M) and I have been dating for almost 11 months now and while we’ve had fights, they have mostly been a result of miscommunications or his difficulty handling his emotions, and they’re also few and far in between. I am infatuated with him and he’s been so kind and supportive to me this whole time. For context (this is relevant I promise), we had been friends for about 5 years now and met in high school through a mutual friend. We got really close through doing theatre at our school and last year our feelings really blossomed when we got cast as love interests in the school musical and that lead to us getting together. I had had a crush on him for years at that point, but doing the show together really escalated those feelings 

At first it felt like a typical ‘showmance’ and I was worried his feelings for me would dwindle after the show was over, but luckily I was wrong and we’re closer than ever before. He’s my best friend in the entire world and I really adore him.
Me and my boyfriend obviously love musical theatre and while I haven’t been able to do any shows outside of school because of my classes, he has been in many performances and I love to support him. 

The problem came with his most recent performance which he did in early March just before the quarantine. He was playing the male lead and the show focuses around his romance with the female lead. The girl playing the female lead was very pretty and obviously talented since she was the lead. I’ll refer to her as C. 

When my boyfriend told me what role her got I was obviously very excited for him but knowing he’d be with another girl on stage made me feel a bit of jealousy. I know he’d had a love interest in his last performance as well but this time it was the focus of the show rather than a subplot. So the performance came and the whole time I watched I felt sick. I was so proud of my boyfriend and wanted to support him but seeing him up there pretending to fall in love with C made me feel physically ill. I’ve always had awful self esteem issues so I couldn’t help but feel jealous. Still, I toughed through it and went to see the show twice, buying him lots of gifts for his final performance. 

I notice the night of his final performance he was very moody and he refused to talk to me for a few days because of a mistake I’d made. It was extremely distressing at the time but I’ve been over it for a while now and our relationship has been way better since then. 

So skip to today and we were talking on the phone and our conversation went to performance week of that show. He said he had fainted backstage during the dress rehearsal and had started crying. I asked him why he cried  during the rehearsal and he said he was nervous to tell me. I encouraged him to open up and he told me that during the week of the performance he felt disconnected from me even though we were talking very regularly. He said he was doubting our relationship then and was starting to get feelings for C. 

When he told me this I felt like my heart had snapped in two. I was devastated to hear that. He then began to reassure me that the only reason he had feelings was because he had to act like he did on stage and that now he has no doubts about our relationship because he loves me so much. I believe him when he tells me he loves me but that hasn’t stopped me from bawling my eyes out. It also reminds me the way our feelings developed for each other when we were cast as love interests together last year, and made me wonder if the situations were similar and if his feelings for me were also a fluke. I’m not angry with him and I still love him but I still feel so devastated that he’d ever have feelings for C and doubt our relationship.

How do I get over this? I love him so much and I know he does too. He’s the only person I can imagine spending the rest of my life with. I just feel my self esteem has taken a huge hit and now all I can think about is how much prettier C is, how better a singer she is, how she’s a better artist. She and my boyfriend don’t even talk anymore but I can’t stop thinking about her and him now and crying. 

My boyfriend says he was wrong for feeling that way and that he loves me and only me, so why can’t I get over it? Am I overreacting? How do I get a grip on my emotions?"
"My flatmate(f/21) was acting wierd, I(m/25) confronted them and now I don't know what is real. What should I do? We have been flatting together since Feb and been stuck together since quarantine began. I thought we were getting along well then about a week or two ago she started acting different around me. Her whole body language was different and our convos were no longer fun, more like battles.

After stressing trying to think what I may have done I asked her straight out. She seemed surprised and said nothing was wrong. now we seem to be back to normal.

But I'm worried she might just be pretending, to avoid hurting my feelings or that thing were a girl may worry a guy will act super upset or not react well to criticism. I here on Reddit all the time how girls just put up with stuff to avoid conflict. 

Am I over thinking, what should I do?"
"How do I (26m) get my wife (26f) to stand on her own two feet and be her own person? My wife and I have been married for 6.5 years. She's great, I love her, she's a fantastic mother to our boys. However, she is extremely introverted and socially anxious, and I'm having an increasingly hard time dealing with it. Anytime she texts or calls people from church, people for business purposes, or even family in certain situations, she will fret for 30 minutes over what she should say, how she should say it, and eventually make ME write it for her or spoon feed her what to say. 

Now I'll say it again, I love this woman, but I want her to be independent. We've had discussions about this, and they never go anywhere. She acknowledges her problem, buy does nothing about it. How do I help her?

Edit: I just want to say thank you to all the wonderful people who have taken the time to read and provide thoughtful comments. I haven't tried to reply, because I didn't think I could keep up, but I am reading each and every suggestion. Your encouragement and insight are extremely helpful.

I apologise if my original post comes off more annoyed or short-tempered, it is my own failing and one I'm actively working on. I totally acknowledge that I am not the resource my wife needs to deal with her own challenges, and I am going to take the advice the majority of you are offering and suggest she seek professional therapy. I am also going to take the advice some others have suggested and just stop helping her with her calls and texts. Maybe it will be gradual, maybe cold turkey. We'll see how it goes. 

Again, thank you to all the good people out here. I hope you all have a wonderful Mother's Day!"
"Zero to freak out My wife and I got into a fight last night. She’s asked a few times for me to not leave “food stuff” in the sink drain at night. Last night I left some lemon pulp in the sink drain. She told me about it and said “I’m appalled that you think this is okay”. I got mad; felt like she was attacking me as a person.

I’m in therapy and working on these issues but slip up from time to time and react to a small issue like she’s going to leave me; which I’m sure is exhausting for her. 

I want to work on being able to take criticism without thinking she wants to leave me; get feedback from my job without thinking I’ll be fired next week. 

Really just wanted to put this out here to see if anyone else feels like this and if anyone has any advice. Thanks"
"My (22M) mother (49F) is extremely controlling and overbearing, and its having a huge impact on my mental health Over the past 6 months I've been dealing with my mum's controlling behaviour. She is someone who cannot be reasoned with whatsoever, if I even try to calmly defend myself even with evidence she just starts shouting louder over me and I get in more trouble. She controls when I wake up and go to sleep, regularly ""checks up"" on me at early hours of the morning (12am - 3am typically) and sometimes just barges in. It all started about 4 months ago when my brother decided to tell my mum we smoke weed. She was okay at first since we were honest, but quickly started taking it out on me and especially my brother since she believes he influenced me. We eventually agreed to not do it under the house, which is annoying but fair I suppose since its her house. I thought it would stop there but it didn't. She tried controlling us to make sure we didn't do it at all, even if we were at a friend's house or something. Whenever I leave the house, they raid our rooms and go through our private stuff to search for any signs of weed of alcohol. She constantly threatens to throw me out, from sleeping in too late/going to bed too late (despite having nothing to do during lockdown since my store I work at is closed), and even when I begrudingly oblige she ALWAYS finds something else to have a go at me for. Just now she loudly knocked on my room at 12am while I was just watching YouTube, and completely went off because I have a wooden wedge to lock my door. She exclaimed I should have no reason to lock my door unless I am doing something I shouldn't, and she always knocks (she doesn't). But as an adult with a girlfriend I need my privacy. What if I'm getting changed, laying in bed with just a towel or masturbating? I've began to have suicidal thoughts because of her aggressive and overbearing behaviour. Its like she has an image in her head of the person she wants me to be, and I am routinely punished and ridiculed for not meeting those expectations, even when I want something different for myself. With no job at the moment (at least during lockdown) I feel like I'm trapped, and every day more and more freedoms are being taken away from me. I'd love to move out and cut contact entirely at this point, only thing stopping me is money and our dog who I'm extremely attached too. I just want to feel like I can be myself without being punished or pressured. Sorry that this is more of a rant, if you have any advice I'd deeply appreciate it. Thanks for reading this far."
"My mom and I got into an argument last week and we made up two days ago. Then last night we got into another argument when she accused me of doing something vindictive to her during that time that I most definitely didn’t do. Now we’re not talking again. I don’t know if our ages matter but I’m 41F and my mom is 64. This is probably a ridiculously trivial thing but it’s really bothering me but I don’t even know if I’m in the right to be as upset about it as I am. I’m angry, hurt and offended though and it’s kept me up all night.

For the majority of our lives we have gotten along really really well, with the occasional arguments but it’s be like once or twice a year, that’s it. For a number of different reasons from both of us, we started living together again three years ago. 95% of the time, this has worked out great for both of us, minus the few arguments I’ve already mentioned. 

In our kitchen we have this molding that goes around walls at about waist level and it sticks out about 2-2.5 inches. Underneath that we have our garbage can and on the wall above that is a big calendar that we both write things on that are important-doctors appointments, when bills are do and how much, when they were paid,etc. 

She had this greeting card from her boyfriend that meant a lot to her and she had it propped up on that ledge, right under the calendar and above the garbage can. My mom comes and knocks on my door and says she wants to talk to me and I can already see and hear in her voice that she’s pissed about something. 

Apparently, sometime in the last week, the card went missing. But what she says to me is “I want to know what happened to my card!” I said what card, the one on the ledge? She said yes and then asks me “Where is it? What did you do with it?” I told her the truth, I said I have no idea what happened to it, why would I even know and keep something like that from her? So then she tells me “Well I don’t know, when we were arguing...” and I cut her off because at this point I’m *really* damn hurt and offended that she would even think that. 

So I told her, look where it was! We both use that garbage can, we both bag up the trash to be taken out, we both write stuff on the calendar. We both had other cards on that ledge that have gotten knocked over repeatedly, that’s why they’re now above where the calendar is. But, at this point I’m crying and my voice was louder because I asked her “Thats really what you think of me? That I would be that spiteful and vindictive? Wtf!” And then I just left and went back to my area and we both are staying away from each other. 

I have *never* spitefully broken or done anything destructive to someone else’s stuff out of anger, and especially not her! I have *accidentally* broken things during a normal day because I’m spastic and clumsy, but I’m not *mean and destructive*. 

I understand being upset about losing the card, I know it meant a lot to her and I would be upset,too. But why, not only blame me, but come at me like I did it on purpose?!? And like I said in the beginning of this, yeah it’s probably petty, but I’m really, really hurt by it, offended and angry. Am I in the wrong here? Do it have a right to be this upset? What do I do?"
"I (25f) don’t know what to do about my sister (22f) and how she treats me It’s a long story, but my sister and I have always had a tumultuous relationship. We’re close in age so the sibling rivalry was very real. Coupled with our unstable and toxic childhood, things weren’t good. We fought a lot. I still have scars on my arms from her. When I was about 16 or so, I just gave up. I stopped fighting, stopped calling her mean names back. I had untreated mental health issues and I just didn’t have the energy to deal with it anymore.

Things got better when we were both in college, but whenever I saw her in person, she would revert somewhat to the person she was and would make fun of me with my brother (19). I tolerated it because we rarely saw each other in person, but when I would message her (usually on Snapchat) she had a habit of talking down to me, lecturing me when I talked about something or just wanted to vent. She’s very involved in social justice and seems to be one of those people who has to be the most “woke” person in the room. 

It came to a head the other day when she lectured me again about something totally innocent (I saw a person walking through a fast food drive thru and thought it was strange. That’s it.). I said “I can’t talk to you about anything” and removed her from my friends on Snapchat. 

I intended to have a conversation with her about how she had been treating me, but before that happened it was my birthday. She didn’t call or text or anything. She sent me 20 on Venmo with the message “HBD”. I lost it. I felt so disrespected, like she couldn’t even bother to send me a full sentence or word. I sent the money back. 

Our birthdays are pretty close (with two years in between) and tomorrow is hers. I’m so torn up about what to do. She hurt me so much but I don’t want to hurt her like that. We haven’t spoken since the drive thru thing, which was a week or two before my birthday. What do I do? Part of me wants to cut her off, but part of me really doesn’t. Plus my mother is guilting me to “rise above.” Any advice would be helpful."
"I (37m) took issue with my wife (35F) because she always complains about doing things with family, and now my marriage is wrecked. Help me understand what I did wrong. My wife has a history of groaning about and dreading anything that involves us taking time away from ourselves in order to do things with other people. Some examples would be: having dinner at my parents’ house, meeting my parents for dinner to celebrate their birthday, going to see her own parents (who live 1.5 hours away) and other family members for anything like birthdays or holiday stuff, going to hang out with her own friends, etc.

At this point, let me say that I recognize that family holiday gatherings and things like kid birthdays are often not very fun or something to look forward to. These things certainly are not my favorite things to do either. But my view is that these are just things you do. Our respective parents love us, and they are not without fault. But we don’t have poor relationships with them. I love my parents and my in laws, so I feel that doing things with them and showing up for holidays and birthdays are standard procedure, even if it’s not the most convenient thing for us.

My wife and I are both introverts. So, I understand how gatherings with multiple people can be a draining thing. But these events I have mentioned are basically 5 or 6 times a year, which doesn’t seem like a lot to me. Also, I just feel that these are normal things that every healthy family does for one another.

This week, we’ve been planning to see both our mothers for Mother’s Day (safely from a distance outside their houses). This was my wife’s idea. Yet, earlier this week, my wife commented that “our weekend is ruined” because of this. She also said “Don’t I deserve a weekend too?” This bothered me. It’s Mother’s Day, and we aren’t even planning to stay long. Her mother lives 1.5 hours away, so that is a larger investment of time, but still a half day at best. My mother is nearby, so the time is far less to see her. I said to her, “It’s not about what we ‘deserve’. We are doing this for them and sacrificing some of our time to do it. We will still have plenty of time in the weekend to do ‘us’ things. If we aren’t willing to sacrifice our own time to do something for our parents, what does that say about us?”

I’m sure that stung, but I had no idea what else to say. I was just shocked by the “I deserve a weekend too” comment and felt it was selfish.

A little more info: we are in our late 30s and have been married 2.5 years, and together for 6. We don’t have kids. We spend the great majority of our time together (and enjoy each other). Quarantine hasn’t been an issue for us. We are both working from home, and not having any problems. I say all this because I feel like now, more than ever, actually leaving the house for half the day shouldn’t be that big of a deal (even for us introverts, even if it means sacrificing weekend time for our families).

Last night, she was again complaining about our weekend plans. This time, I just came out with it. I asked her why it’s always an issue for us to do anything for anyone other than ourselves. Obviously this didn’t go well, and it turned into an argument. She asked me “why does it matter?” To which I replied “I have anxiety about each time I need to ask you to do something like this. That’s why.” It went on and I pointed out that she views doing anything with anyone as a chore, even hanging out with her own friends. I just genuinely wanted to understand why this is. But she stormed out and slept in a separate room.

This morning, she has given me the silent treatment and said that I made her feel like shit. I know that is true, and I don’t ever want her to feel like shit or be hurt. I truly had no idea how to express this issue to her other than how I did. I remained calm through the whole thing, but it was still clearly heated. This has just happened many times, and I’ve spoken up about it in more subtle ways many times. This time, I felt I should just be more on the nose about it and say that I believe it’s selfish.

I apologized for hurting her feelings, and asked how I can better voice stuff like this, but she won’t talk to me other than to say she doesn’t want to be around me. I asked her if I was out of line, and she won’t even remotely respond to me. I asked her to work with me on this and have a conversation, but she said she isn’t interest in working with me.

Am I the asshole? Because I sure feel like one."
"My bf (29M) is condescending and blames me (24F) for everything when we fight We’ve been together 4 months. I’ve told him multiple times that I don’t like the mean, condescending tone he uses with me when we have a disagreement and we agreed we would both use “I” instead of “you” language. He said he would do better with both of those things. However, I have seen zero effort on his part on changing the way he talks to me and he blames it on me. He refuses to use “I” language, and again says everything is my fault. When I try to explain my side, he rolls his eyes and says “I don’t want to hear it, I don’t care, it’s obvious you’re the one in the wrong here and that’s it.” When we argued before, he said he used that tone with me because of the tone I used and when I shut down that triggers him. During arguments before I used to raise my voice and also shut down and have problems communicating my thoughts, and I’ve made serious efforts to get better on those things.. But last night I was at a loss. 

We had a good night together. When we went upstairs to go to bed, I was excited for him to come to bed with me because I was a little horny and just wanted some gentle sex before going to sleep. He came to the room and just laid on the floor and meditated for 20 minutes, and I was sitting there a little confused that he didn’t acknowledge me or ask me to meditate with him (it’s something we like to do together), he kind of just did it without saying anything. I didn’t want to make a big deal out of that because I knew it was a little ridiculous for me to be upset about so I just dropped it and thought next time I would just take the initiative and ask, but I’m not going to lie that hurt a little bit. 

He came to bed and he grabbed his book to read and left the light on and didn’t tell me goodnight (didn’t say anything to me) so my thoughts were he wasn’t planning to go to sleep right that second. I was cuddling him and I looked up at him to see if he was still awake, and I was debating if I should initiate something. I wasn’t sure if that was something he wanted right then but he had told me in the past he wants me to initiate more so I wanted to do that. I was just trying to decide if it was the right moment. So I sat up a little and looked at him and he said “what?” I asked him if he was sleeping, and he said “yeah, what do you want?” And I could tell he was irritated. So I decided it was NOT the right moment and I shouldn’t say anything about it and let him go to sleep. I said “you’re sleepy, it’s nothing.” He said “no I can tell you want something, just tell me.” I didn’t want to have any kind of disagreement or make him upset, so I said “it’s not important, can we just drop it please?” He kept angrily hounding me to tell him so I told him I wasn’t sure if it was the right time to initiate sex, and that’s why I looked at him like that. I again said I wanted to drop it because I knew it would turn into a fight. He didn’t listen to that and said “you can clearly see I’m tired, can’t you read cues?” I explained that since he left the light on and grabbed his book to read but wanted to cuddle for a little first I read that as he wasn’t going to sleep right that second. I explained if he had turned off the light and said goodnight, that would’ve been a clear signal he wants to go to sleep. (He also meditated for a longer time than his usual 7 minutes, which isn’t something I would do if I was exhausted, but I didn’t bring that up to him). He rolled his eyes and went on to say he didn’t care what I thought and I just didn’t read his cues and respect his basic needs to sleep and that I was selfish and that was that. So honestly, that triggered me to go into defensive mode. I said “this is exactly why I didn’t want to have this conversation right now.” I was upset that I tried to avoid exactly this, and this is where we were so I tried desperately to resolve it. I apologized for misreading his cues, but he continued to go on about how I ruined the whole night and how I always do this. He recognized the tone he was using but said it was my fault the way he was talking to me because he was pissed. This went into a downhill spiral quickly, and I felt like I couldn’t get out of it. I eventually went to the bathroom to give us space, cried for a few minutes, and went back to him and just wanted to move on. I laid there for a few minutes and I was still upset and hurt, but I rolled over to cuddle him. I didn’t want to wake up in the morning in this negative space with each other when that didn’t need to happen, and I told him that. I didn’t want us to hold onto these negative emotions all night and into the morning and ruin our day because that’s toxic and it happened before, and I didn’t want that. He said “this is on you, I’m done talking about it, it’s done.” I said “I’m just trying to understand where I went wrong, I apologized for misreading your cues and I wasn’t mean to you this whole time.” He continued to say I blamed him for everything and kept digging (referring to that time when I explained how I read his cues). I said I wasn’t trying to blame him for anything I was just trying to understand what happened so we can solve this, and he said “shut up. If you talk one more time, I’m going to ask you to leave.” I said “maybe I should leave because I refuse to go to bed and wake up like this.” He immediately got up and ripped the covers off of me, and I left because he threatened to break up with me if I didn’t. 

I’m still confused why it had to go that way. I didn’t start out being passive aggressive to trigger anything in him, I tried to kindly let it go. I wasn’t trying to make him do anything he wants to do, I just had a different expectation initially but I accepted that and wanted to let it go and move on. I honestly wasn’t aware how tired he was, that’s why I tried to gauge it and figure it out at first. I was just trying to have a good end to the night- clearly that did not go as planned.

I just want us to be able to explain our sides, respectfully listen to each other, then come to a resolution together to make sure both needs are met in the moment. I want us to own our own feelings instead of blaming each other for how we treat one another. That’s all I want but I feel like it’s impossible to have a conversation like that with him and I’m at a loss. If I tell him how his tone continues to be an issue for me when we disagree, he puts it on me and I hate the way he talks to me. It feels one sided at this point. How do I gently communicate this to him when he doesn’t take responsibility for how he treats me in the moment? I really don’t want to keep talking about this situation with him because I know nothing will change with how he sees this, but I don’t want it to happen again. I feel like I learn from conflict to make myself better and I’m not seeing that with him. I feel like I’m stuck."
"What's the deal with missing someone anyway? The feeling of missing someone, that horrible feeling, what's the deal? Why does it suck so much? What's the greater purpose or meaning for it? Is it just nature's way of motivating you to spend time with someone you've bonded with? What is a bond anyway?"
"Giving my long distance fiancé an ultimatum I (F20) gave my fiancé (M23) an ultimatum in our relationship. I live in Ontario, Canada and he in Michigan, USA. We are roughly 3 hours away from each other. We have been together for 4 years. Our relationship  has been struggling during quarantine. We have 2 kids together a 2 yr old and a 6 month old which I take care of. He has no responsibilities what so ever. All I ask from him is to call me for 1 hour everyday. 1 hour out of a 24hour day. He’s been struggling to do that which has lead me to be very unhappy in our relationship because he has all the time in the world living with his parents and playing video games on his computer all day when I take care of our two kids at my place. We were texting tonight and I gave him the ultimatum that if he doesn’t drop what he’s doing right now to call me within the next hour we are done. Mind you this is like 12am so he’s was probably either on his computer playing games or in bed texting me. He didn’t call so I guess we aren’t together anymore. He made the excuse that his phone wasn’t charged. I have also told him many times in these 3+ months that if he can’t call me once a day for an hour we can’t be together as I am unhappy in our relationship, which he keeps saying he’s sorry and will change. I don’t know what to do. I love him and I would love to stay together for our kids but I want to be happy as well. We were planning on getting married this year, do I stay for the sake of our kids? Do I wait for him to change to how he used to be? Am I stupid for wanting to call off our relationship for this reason?"
"Breakup text - Is this a good one? Talked (28f) yesterday with my 4 months boyfriend (32m) about relationships. I stated I feel we need to talk more (during lockdown we are barely talking). He mentioned that he didn't want to stay in this city, and he is not planning to change his mind since he changed his mind for his last girlfriend (2 years ago in a different city) but she ended up dumping him. I think I want to end things since I'm not planning on attaching myself to someone this shielded. I came up with this, please let me know your opinion. 

_I'm so glad we talked yesterday. I liked you a lot, you are smart, funny, charming and we had chemistry. But it's very obvious that you are not the type of guy who invests in a relationship and who doesn't work on things. I wanted things to work to be honest, I thought we had potential. But this is how much you want to give, and I understand that. Unfortunately, I don't think this is something I'm ok with. Please understand that even for a casual thing, being this shutdown is not ok. Comparing me to whatever your ex did is not ok. Lockdown or no lockdown, future or no future, an interest is an interest. I'm starting to develop feelings and I don't want to be alone in that. I'd like to start seeing other people. Good luck in everything, I hope you find what you are looking for._"
"My bf wants a joint bank account As said above, my (20f) bf (20m) wants a joint bank account. We talked about it earlier in the year, to save up for a wedding. When we were talking about it I was excited and idk this has anything to do with my reaction but I have adhd - when I get excited about things I kind of go overboard. I then thought about how I go to a university and how FAFSA pays for board &amp; tuition. I can’t have my own savings bc FAFSA will deduct my tuition so I thought about giving the money to my mom instead for her to save up in her accounts. I told my bf this and he’s mad that we aren’t going to save together. He says he could put it into his account and that it could be “our” account even though legally it would all be his. I trust him but I’m trying to be safe, by putting my money under my mom’s name instead. He’s mad because he wanted us to save together and have us “take the next step.” Now he’s saying that he never wants to have anything joint since I don’t “trust him”- apparently he thinks I think that he doesn’t have the human decency to give me money back if anything happened."
"My(23F) girlfriend (23F) wouldn't give me space after an argument and I ended up having a panic attack because she wouldn't leave. This is long I apologize in advance!
I need help. I have tried explaining it to her several times that I need time to process emotions after an argument. Especially now since I haven't been to therapy due to quarantine, normally I have the tools and vocabulary to explain this but with everything going on I am at my wits end with how to emotionally handle her need to be around me after the argument. 
For example, last night we got into over money as we are moving apartments soon. I have lived on my own and supported myself for a while, with some financial hardships but I've been ok for the most part. She is in a better situation than me and we had agreed that she would pay 2/3s of the rent and I would pay 1/3 so I could rebuild my savings.( her suggestion)
 In the heat of our argument over me getting a better laptop for work she brought up rather aggressively that she would ""love to spend money on other things but she has paid x amount for our deposit"" this struck a nerve with me as I have had people throw finances in my face before and why I was hesitant to split them unevenly in the first place. She knows this. 
I expressed my feelings to her this afternoon when we decided to talk it out after work. 
We worked through most of it but emotions ran high again as I was still hurt that she would say that knowing it was something that bothered me.  She was crying and apologized saying she knows she fucked up which I accepted, but said that I think some time alone would help us and asked her to stay at her place which she hadn't been to in a month and a half. Cue her crying and telling me she can't because she will be worrying that I am going to break up with her all night, something I have never said and I reassured her that I really just need some space. This argument carries on to the point where we are both crying, I am begging her to leave and ended up hyperventilating in my room until she finally left....
How do I tell her to leave me alone without her getting upset?"
"So... should I notify the police if my spouse hits me but rarely leaves a mark? Again just now: punches, threats, verbal abuse, impeding me leaving, blocking the exit... but I have no marks. At all. What should I do? It happens about once a month now. Im embarrassed and feel ashamed. Also sad for my kids who have no idea because we’re not yelling. And I barely work due to the current pandemic, so she’s the money maker right now. Without her income we’d fall behind on bills. I’m a male and it’s my wife being physical. I’m way bigger than her too and because she rarely leaves any marks I don’t know if it’s even worth notifying anyone."
"I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) for two years. He has serious mental health issues and I’m stuck in quarantine with him. What do I do? I moved across the country with him after only dating for about 4 months. I had no idea how bad his mental health was until we were already living together. About six months into the relationship, I realized the full extent of it through a lot of arguments and him becoming more comfortable and open around me. Right around then, I said “I love you” for the first time and he got extremely angry at me for saying it because “he was planning something.” We didn’t talk that entire day and I was left feeling heartbroken. After that, I learned a lot more about him. Sooner than later, it had already been a year of living together and things were not great. I could go on and on about everything that happened but that would just become a novel. Basically, we fought all the time. And I don’t mean the healthy kind of fighting. He would have full-blown meltdowns where he would hyperventilate, scream into a pillow, frantically run all around the room, and so on. It was bad. 

At that point, I felt like his mother. He fully depended on me for everything. He was going to grad school and his job was a teacher's assistant. I had a good-paying job so I paid for a lot of things that he couldn’t afford. I wouldn’t have minded that much if there was a balance. He never did any chores/dishes/cleaned. He never listened to me when I talked. His phone/laptop was 10x more important than me. He always showed me or talked about things I could change about my appearance because “You would look really cool that way.” There’s an endless list.

Basically, his mental health is his worst enemy and I’ve tried so many times to get him to do something about it. He’s addicted to his phone, mainly Instagram because he’s a musician and he’s constantly hoping to make it one day like all the people he sees on Insta. He stays up every night until 4 am because he can’t sleep ever. He has some really really bad days where there’s nothing that can be done to cheer him up and it affects my day to the point where I give up for the rest of the day. 

Flash forward to today, I broke up with him 3-4 months ago and moved back across the country to go back to school for myself. A month after we broke up, we started talking again and he had been going to therapy and starting his own business and making all of these changes in his life. He was moving back to our home state which was a 10-hour drive from where I was and I decided to start talking to him again-not back together just talking.

Well, of course, two-ish months ago was when COVID started really affecting the U.S. Maybe I was naive, but I drove to his place at the beginning of March. I’ve been quarantined with him since then and it’s been about two months. Things have gone right back to where they were and I honestly think I just hate him at this point. He has a lot of mental issues he needs to work out and he tries to be better while we are here but I don’t think I want to give him the chance. Any time he messes up, I instantly get mad and we get in a huge fight that destroys a whole day. I’m a genuinely happy person usually and these fights drain the life out of me. Plus, they are happening 3-4 times a week. 

I don’t know what to do because there have been at least 5 times where I started packing my stuff but realized I couldn’t really leave. I think I keep thinking to myself that if I just make it through quarantine then I can be done with him, but can I really keep living with him and pretending it’s okay? It wouldn’t be possible to break up with him while I’m here because he wouldn’t stop bothering me every day if I did. I care a lot about him and want him to get the help he needs but I can’t be his mother/therapist/maid/sugar mama/girlfriend all at the same time anymore. It’s killing me.

Help me reddit. Should I just give up already and leave?

TL;DR My boyfriend has serious mental health issues that affect my life. I’ve become more of a mother/therapist than a girlfriend and it’s really toxic. We have horrible, life-depleting fights 3 times a week. I’m naively stuck in quarantine with him, what do I do?"
"My (31m) girlfriend (29f) says she “needs space” because she is overwhelmed. Claims everything will be ok because that’s just how she is. It’s been a week of silence, I’m worried. Hello all. Long read so get ready. Here’s the backstory. So I’ve been dating this girl for 5 months now. We were best friends in our teenage years and after being out of contact in our 20’s we reconnected in January and sparks flew. We hit it off so well it was incredible! So we decided to start seeing each other on a romantic level and began dating. We live 3 hours apart so we are in a LDR, and since the quarantine has hit it has given us a chance to talk on the phone a lot and really connect emotionally, she drives up to me every weekend too to spend weekends at my house as well. Everything has been going fantastic, sex is amazing, we laugh a lot, enjoy each others company, have great conversations, and are very comfortable together. 

And last week while we were on the phone she tells me, “hey I’m feeling a little overwhelmed by all of this, I think I need a little space.” I was kind of floored by this statement as I didn’t quite understand why or what she meant by “space.” After a lot of back and forth she explained to me that she gets freaked out by relationships and sometimes just needs to shut down for a little and be detached from me. I asked her what exactly that looked like and how much time she needed, she got very mad at me asking detailed questions and told me I just don’t understand her and that I’m not listening to her. She then freaked way the fuck out and started saying stuff like she doesn’t believe in labels, that I’m putting straining expectations on her, and that we weren’t on the same page anymore about our relationship, when we already established what we both wanted out of the relationship months before and were very much on the same page. At this point I’m a deer in the headlights, I couldn’t even process wtf was going on and how she could flip her entire attitude and demeanor that quick. The conversation ended with her reiterating that I didn’t understand her because I kept asking her for any details and explaining why I wanted details. But she told me to back off and that everything would be fine if I just let her breathe. 

Well it’s been a week now and I’m beginning to get worried. I have fallen hard for this girl, I love her so much and she reciprocated those feelings to me. To me this kind of behavior she’s displaying seems immature. How do you just stop talking to someone you fell in love with? Everything was going so smooth. I don’t know if she’s gone or to actually believe her when she said she would be back and just needed some time. Has anyone ever dealt with this kind of thing before? Do I check in with her or will that just make her more angry? I don’t get it at all. Please help.

SUMMARY: Everything was going great with my gf, then she freaked out and claimed she needed space and that she will be back when she’s ready, it’s been a week of silence and I’m perplexed by this behavior."
"Cheaters suck they leave you stuck A little backstory: I’ve been dating my bf for almost 2 years now, I’d like to say that we have a good relationship but it has been pretty rough. We’ve been through a lot/ put each other through a lot as well. We live together and have a little fur baby. 
Recently I’ve found that he’s been talking to girls over Snapchat, and this isn’t the first time I’ve caught him talking to other girls. We argue, he says that they are just friends, but I got ahold of his phone while he was asleep and noticed he was being flirty, replying back to girls stories and stuff. Which really hurt my feelings bc I 100% trusted him. He doesn’t know I snooped through his phone and he acts like everything is normal (I act like I never found anything either cause I’m not ready for that battle). He’s overly nice to me now and I can’t go on being fake like this, but I also don’t have enough proof to leave him. I know he’ll just try to lie his way out and keep me around bc he loves me. I want out, I want to leave him and take my dog that I pay for and care for and just go. But he holds my animal hostage and brings up getting out of the lease when I actually do try to leave. He won’t let me take my dog, which is a huge form of emotional support for me. Our lease is about to be up in September and I’m thinking that once it’s up I just move back home and get myself together. But he’s looking for a new house and showing me places when I know fully well I don’t want to do that (just don’t know how to tell him). I’m needing advice for 1. How do I tell him that I know and I’m done with him? Should I just wait till the lease is up?  2. How do I find a way to keep my animal bc I take such good care of him and I know if I were to leave my bf he would take my dog and not give him the best possible care like I do :("
"I(29F) feel like Im missing one of my sense - but its the sixth sense of social context I was trying to describe this to a friend a few minutes ago and all I did was end up crying.

I feel sometimes like, when it comes to social interactions, its as if Im walking around with a blindfold and then told to describe the room Im standing in. Except, its like - understand the social context/clues of a room or specific situation. I cant always tell if Ive really made someone mad/the joke went too far. I can't always really tell if someones bored or annoyed by me. I cant always tell if someones disappointed in something I did.

Ive questioned before if Im somewhere on the autistic spectrum. Except there are times I -do- understand all these social context clues but its generally way easier the better I know someone. And theres plenty of emotions I can understand clearly - like anger, sadness, happiness. I wish I had the words to describe it better, its more like when its subtle or complex that I just feel bewildered.

This came up recently, of course with dating. I do the thing I know plenty of people do. ""Does he like me back?"" But when I was really trying to describe it to someone I realized....Im not getting any underlying 'vibe' about it. Because no matter how much you describe the situation to someone (ohh this person is my friend but sometimes I think he might like me, and Im afraid its wishful thinking because I like him..) it generally comes down to trusting your gut. Or people saying ""when someone likes you, youll know"".

And maybe all of that is fairly normal and something we all struggle with but it just made me realize how much in my life Im double checking with a friend that they got the same subtext out of a situation that I did. I was doing it subconsciously but I always do it. i.e. ""That person seemed frustrated like they were in a hurry, I wonder if they were worried or we pissed them off"" Cue friend chiming in ""Oh I think they were just busy"".  And its just me masking that I had NO idea what that person was feeling.

Recently I also told a friend of mine I needed space from him but I hoped we would be ok once I got that space - and once I told him like, ""ok, Im fine"" it never felt like it went back to normal and Im clueless enough that I can't *exactly* figure out why (another example).

**Tl;dr I feel like Im going through life missing one of my senses, except its a six sense, of being able to understand social context and I want to know if theres any advice on how to be better at this**"
"My parents (57m) and (56f) and I (19f) got into a weird argument that hasn’t been sitting well with me for a couple of days. How do I move forward. To start off my parents are great people. They work really hard to provide a lovely life for me. I have no siblings so it’s one shot to get this kid perfect haha. I also come from and Asian - European household. 

Anyways, I was having a conversation about the classes I took in high school with my mom. I dedicated 3 years to an architect and interior design program and quit my senior year. When she asked why I said “Because you literally told me not to every day until I gave into going to a regular college for business instead of art/ design school for this.” She then goes on to completely trash that career choice saying “INTERIOR DESIGN IS THE MOST LOSER JOB. ONLY LOSERS GO FOR THAT JOB.” I tried to explain the different types of interior designs and architectural fields there were but she was just like “that’s for losers.” 
I felt so offended idk why. I brushed it off and kept eating dinner. 

Fast forward to the next evening when my mom starts asking me why I haven’t joined any clubs this past year of college. I said that I’m working on my own things and find that a lot of these clubs take up way too much time and commitment. I told her that after college i wanted to start businesses and continue with my day trading stocks career I started for myself and try to build wealth. With this comes great amounts of time and dedication. 

Again she goes to completely trash the idea. Says that I’ll never make it in what I want to do and says that only losers do this kind of thing when they start failing college. I’m not failing college...I think. My dad goes on to point out that “I couldn’t even get into a real college so It’s like I’m attending a loser school anyway.” I just go to a smaller college that’s not Harvard or NYU. 

I get that they want the best for me and just want me to be a stable person long term but it’s like they always trash my interests calling it loser interest, calling my college a loser school. Am I a loser then? Is every achievement and thing I do just a fake complement? I feel offended honestly and kind of sad. I mean I’ll never give up on what I want to do but even my mom came up to me and was like “I pray to god every day that He gives you a brain to pick a REAL career.” Even if I go and talk to them about my feelings about this situation, they will still have the feelings that they do. I just want to move forward with them but I can’t stop thinking about this. Am I really a loser? Am I that much of a disappointment? I love them and they’ve done so much for me I don’t want to be mad. What do I do?"
"I still feel loyal to my ex even though I’ve met someone new So I’m a 23 year old guy. I’ve recently met this girl who is absolutely amazing. She’s smart, sexy, kind but feisty, loyal, doesn’t want to sleep around. I’ve completely lucked out. 

But for some reason, I can’t shake this mental loyalty to my ex. My ex was at the very least a bully. She may have been a narcissist but I’m not sure. She was judgemental, hot and cold, loved to put me down to build herself up. Gaslighted me. Yet I still loved her. She triggered some sort of existential crisis when she left to the point where I really feel like my brain sort of went through a re-wiring process. I had to go to therapy for months, went on SSRI’s, it’s like I couldn’t handle all these truths that were being thrown at me. 

But it’s bothering me a lot. This girl I’ve met recently could easily be someone I could see mothering my children. She’s absolutely amazing. (Plus she has big bazoongas so good lord am I attracted to her). I feel extremely guilty for harbouring these thoughts and I feel it’s preventing me from really emotionally attaching to her. Something I think she’s noticed. 

I’m worried I’m still holding a place for her in my mind and if she comes back (which isn’t impossible one day), I might not know what to do. 

How do I deal with this?? 

Thanks"
"I am standing my ground and not going back, because once a cheater, always a cheater. Male (33), we will call him Bob, and Female (32) we will call her (Jane). Hypothetical names, very real situation. This relationships was about 3 years old when, Bob decided to start lying more than usual and follow that up with cheating. When confronted by Jane, he naturally denied it, then proceeded to attempt to manipulate Jane and threat her like crap. Now, Bob is very cautious to not make it obvious to his friends and family that he was treating Jane like crap. He did it in subtle ways like being condescending to her under his breath, lying to his friends, and family - telling them she was treating him bad, when in fact it was the exact opposite. He could not control how he made her feel about herself, so he decided to try to control how other people felt about her. She saw all these things and stayed with him, because they have a child together, and she wanted to keep things as peaceful as possible for the sake of the child. 

As time progressed she became ore and more unhappy and decided to go ahead and end the relationship, as she and the child may indeed be better off in a less toxic environment. He refused to leave, fast forward to sometime after, he comes to Jane, crying saying he has been unfaithful for a while, and it only happened once, he is hurt and knows she deserves better, and want to leave the relationship. Jane is not surprised, and  allows him to leave the relationship, as she knows she deserves better, and she did her best.

Now some time has passed by, he want to come back, he calls himself a fool. He is begging to come back. However, she is not convinced he means any of what he is saying. She is not convinced that he is any different (in a good way, maybe he got worse). He even tried using the child as an excuse as to why they should make up. However, children benefit from happy parents, not parents who are simply together, just to be together. She is standing her ground, because she deserves better. What are your thoughts?"
"How do I (27F) get my partner (33M) to help out around the house? I do everything except cut the lawn. 

Dishes.
Laundry. 
Picking up.
Vacuuming/sweeping/mopping.
Cleaning the bathroom/toilet/shower.
Taking out garbage.
Cleaning up his beer cans 80% of the time.
Etc.

When I say everything, I mean it.

And idk what else to do to try to get my partner to help around the house. 

I’ve done everything from reminding him politely throughout the day/week to pick up or do his chores to getting really upset, at which point his response is “live with it or don’t”. Not his exact words, mind you, but he was basically telling me to accept it, and I won’t. I just don’t think it’s fair for two people to live together and 1 person do all the work. Even BESIDES our relationship. 

I’m about ready to tell him that I can’t live with him if he can’t pick up after himself. I just can’t live in a house that’s COMPLETELY wrecked all the time. It makes me feel sluggish and depressed and lays down an environment for my mental health to decline. 

He told me he has *self diagnosed* depression (at least, I think it’s self diagnosed. In the last 5 years he’s never gone to a mental health professional - so I’m just assuming), and I don’t want to hurt him - but I just don’t see what else I can do? 

Do you have any other solutions? Has anything else worked for you? 

I’m going to talk with him on Monday - but I wanted other opinions and solutions to make sure I have as full and as round of a perspective as possible. 

Also - I’ve asked him why he doesn’t clean up, he just says “because I don’t”. So. Yeah."
"When do you know when to cut the cord and move on? Him and I aren’t dating, but we talked a lot and was even supposed to go on a date (but couldn’t cause of the corona virus). For the past month, we’ve gotten more distant, and during this quarantine thing, we talked less and less and he started to leave me on delivered for hours. At this point, we’re not even talking, and just doing streaks (on Snapchat). I kinda cared in the beginning and was always anxious when he wouldn’t text me back, but I soon stopped caring, because I had suspicions he was talking to another girl. Should I just stop replying to his streaks (I think they’re kinda useless) and move on? If I did that, would it be an ass hole move?"
"Did I do the right thing by asking my bf to leave after he texted suggestive things to another female? Sorry if this is rambling, this just happened and I'm still very much not ok. 

I (21F) just found out that my bf (23m) of 5 years was asking a friends ex if she likes big d*cks, being flirty, asking what type of guys she's into... thankfully she told me and sent screenshots of messages that he had since deleted on his phone. He said he doesnt know why he did it, then said it was bc he was drunk. I told him I at least need a few days. He has since texted saying he doesnt want me to take him back. He knows he messed up and and didnt try to deny it. I was completely blindsided by this and I still love him so much and just want to be with him. We had so many plans for our future and have a dog together. 

Additional information, he has done this before 3-4 years ago twice. Last time it happened it was him asking another female if she wants to come to him and do sexual things, another time he was just flirting with another girl. I never thought I'd have this problem again. 

I am so beyond hurt and it just seems surreal. I spent so much of my life with him. I just need to know if I did the right thing? What am i supposed to do now? All I want is him, I know I shouldnt but I do."
"My father (59M) is stuck in the past and has destroyed his life through self-pity, alcohol and resentment. What should I (28M) do? (crosspost /r/relationships) Hello, my mum and dad got divorced when I was 7 years old and it was a messy one. A lot of my early memories involve them just shouting at each other.

My mum remarried and had another child, but after the divorce my dad went off the rails. Whilst he can be caring and loving he chose to wallow in self pity and binge drinking. During the period just after the divorce I wanted a normal relationship with him but he would often let me down and be uncontactable. Since that time he has held an unhealthy resentment towards my mother and hasn't been afraid to let me and my siblings know about it. He tells us in great detail his (one-sided) version of events of his marriage breakdown and has been portraying her as evil for a long time. For a long time I was confused about what to think.

He behaviour has been erratic through the years, he is nice and lulls you into a false sense of him turning to corner only to turn around and be nasty and spiteful, and if you ever call him out on his behaviour he turns on you as well. He has pushed most people from his life, friends, family and colleagues (he hasn't worked now in over a decade), but never accepts blame for how his life has turned out and blames my mother still.

Some examples of his erratic behaviour include getting into a physical confrontation with my (maternal) grandmother and her husband when I was a child. Coming into my mum's place of work drunk and causing a big scene in front of her colleagues. Physically assaulting my step-father in front of me when I was 13. He once tried to start a fight with me and my brother on the day of our step-grandad's funeral. When my best friend died at age 25, the lowest point of my life, he offered no real emotional support and instead had a huge falling out with me because I didn't want to take up his offer of a new mobile phone (he often thinks he can bribe his way into affection). He frequently used to be normal for a while only to binge drink on heavy spirits later and let us down. I've turned up at his house numerous times to check up on him only to find the doors locked and curtains drawn despite him being in. Often he will just be passed out somewhere in his underpants. Once I knocked so hard on the door because I wanted him to answer I smashed the window pane on the door accidently. I can remember crying as a 12 year old because his phone always used to go to voicemail. He has said nasty  things I would never dream of saying to my future children like he isn't proud of me for studying physics at a doctorate level.

He has been trying to play all of us against our mum for the past 20ish years and tells us the inappropriate (and one-sided) details of the breakdown of their marriage to the point of madness.

Despite all this behaviour, he is adamant he has never done any wrong and has even turned the finger on me and my siblings, calling us immoral and citing (the same) minor grievances he has against us. He often tries to turn us against each other as well. Anybody who calls him out on his erratic behaviour gets the same treatment and he never once acknowledged or apologised for it.

His latest rant against me was when I let it slip that we had considered looking into sectioning at one point. It's very clear he needs professional intervention of some kind, but I'm not sure he poses enough of a real threat to himself or others to warrant it. It was a thought born from desperation and now he thinks we are the devil incarnate for even considering it.

Despite this, all I've ever wanted is for him to move on from the past and find some kind of peace and happiness because I know there is a kind man lurking beneath all this warping. What should I do? I had to cut him out recently on the advice of my therapist because the distress it was causing me was affecting my PhD, but after the coronavirus pandemic started I got back into contact with him, which was fine for a while but then quickly descended into the same old texts about the past and how nasty my mother is. What should I do? How do I proceed?

TL;DR My dad has been living a shell of a life for the last 20 years after his divorce and shows no desire to change, this cause me and my siblings major distress. What should I do?"
"Kids (or not to kids) Ok so this is my first post on this site and I am probably doing it wrong.. 

I have been seeing a guy who is slightly older than me, he is 36 and I am 29. He has two children from a previous relationship. He has mentioned a few times how he would consider having more children but only if he was married. 

We have been seeing eachother for about 6 months and have become extremely close, I have never felt like this about anyone and I know he feels the same. 

Out of the blue he said he wanted to have a talk. He wanted to say that he loves me more than he thought he ever could and he wants to stay together forever but he wants to be honest and say that after thinking about it he has decided he definitely doesn’t ever want more kids. His reasoning is that he has done it all already and doesn’t want to be an ‘old dad’. 

I tried to say that he wouldn’t be old even if he was 40 or more but he is set in his ways and says he cannot change his mind. I have always wanted children and I always wanted more than one but I did say if I could have one child myself that would be a compromise from me and I would still be happy. But he doesn’t want any. 

It’s not his fault I know and he is entirely entitled to feel the way he does and I appreciate that he is doing the right thing and being honest with me. I feel so upset because we both love eachother very much and I feel conflicted as to what to do. I don’t want to lose this man who is everything to me but I also want to have a child of my own. On the other hand I may break up with him and never find someone else I feel as strongly about and I will end up alone anyway without him and his children, who I also really love. 

So, the following day we had another chat. His main worries are actually financial I think and about how his children will feel. He also seems to have a thing about feeling ‘not good enough’ for me. He says I deserve the world and shouldn’t have to settle for someone like him. At the same time I have said to him please be brutally honest, do you want to break up and he says no he really wants to stay together. 

Anyway I asked him to think about it he can possibly change his mind as I don’t want to throw away what we have and I would love to build a family with him and his kids, I feel that his worries are things we can work through. He said he would. That was almost 3 weeks ago and since then we haven’t spoken about the subject, we speak slightly less but still every day (mutual as to who contacts who first). We have seen eachother a few times a week (we were all living together at the start of lockdown so no need to not see eachother now). We have acted normal and the kids have always been there so we haven’t spoken anymore about it. 

How long do you think it is reasonable for him to expect me to carry on like this? I don’t think he realises, but I am really upset and crying myself to sleep most nights, feeling very lost and alone. I haven’t said this to him but he does know I am upset. I understand that this is a huge decision for him to make but at the same time I feel like this is just natural progression for a relationship and I’m not actually asking that much.. just what ‘normally’ happens. I feel that it maybe shouldn’t be such a massive decision for him? 

I don’t want to rush his decision or to put pressure on him but it’s very hard for me to act normal around his kids etc but there is this feeling of ‘elephant in the room’. I want to sit down with him and talk but he always says he is still thinking and not to put pressure on him.. 

Any advice for this situation? Thank you in advance."
"[21M] My girlfriend [24F] touches me too much. Being quarantined with her is basically like having a conjoined twin, it’s that annoying. She says that she can’t help herself because I have a really nice body, and that’s very flattering, but the never-ending kissing and groping is getting old really fast. I’m not sure how to ask for some space without it coming off the wrong way."
"Ex Siblings I was in an abusive marriage for five years, we didn’t have children together but he have his own kids full time and I had mine full time so it was a very blended family. All around the same age. We’ve been divorced for 10 months, ex has been very vindictive and still trying to destroy my life till this day. I spoke to my kids early on, therapist and I decided it was best for my kids to not have any contact with his kids due to the circumstances. Yesterday I found out that all the kids still communicate and I took my kids phones and blocked all of his kids contacts. Then I felt bad because they were siblings for five years so I told my kids if they’d like to communicate then it’s fine but do not share any information with them as far as what’s going on here in our home. Am I wrong? Idk what to do to keep my kids and I safe from further abuse mentally from the ex."
"My (18M) girlfriend (16F) told me she's not sexually attracted to guys, and I'm really hurt. We've been dating for a little over a month, but we've been best friends for over a year now.

Last night I was texting her about how I need more communication in our relationship and out of that she told me she doesn't think she's sexually interested in guys or could ever have sex with one. She has trauma from her past and I've been respectful and haven't pushed at all for sex considering I'm not ready for it at all because of my own past. But when she told me that I kinda, fell apart? I can't look at myself in the mirror, and I've felt so out of place since she told me. I know its not something she can control, and her sister told me that gf is confused because of her past and feelings for me and doesn't actually feel that way.

I guess I'm here to rant about how I feel and to ask what I should do? Am I even justified to be hurt? I really like her and we weren't anywhere comfortable with sex anyways, but now I feel just, ashamed and like I have to hide any part of me thats sexual. I can't even imagine going to like a pool with her and being shirtless now. The most we did was make out but now I feel like she never even wanted to kiss me. I don't know how to tell her how hurt I am or if I even should because she's really upset that she hurt me."
"Breakup limbo. Living together for three weeks after we have broken up but neither can leave. (f24) (m24) I had been with my boyfriend for over five years and we moved fast, moved in together within months. We both claim we changed within the first year, the most noticeable for him would be his anger and being controlling. He hasn't really given me examples of how I changed within that first year so I'm not too sure. I do know that about two years ago when his anger was becoming more manageable, my anger was going in the opposite direction. So we've both been toxic and abusive, I won't deny that. 


Things did get kind of completed in April of 2019, I found out he had cheated the majority of the relationship through sexting and such. Around that time I had a breakdown where I hurt myself and went for mental help. Then in October of 2019 I cheated by posting nudes online and I still regret it. I wanted connection, he was on a business trip and he refused to do anything about the cheating, he just wanted to forget about it.


Anyways, things have been really confusing lately. We had an argument and technically broke up but we've been living together for almost three weeks. I think it was confusion and misinterpretation of each others words, had probably like three argument as to whether we are really broken and up and it seems we're on the same page of broken up, living together but not knowing where the other stands at the moment. During the second argument he said he was already looking for another place and hes waiting for someone to get back to him. To me that was pretty clear but a comment was made and he said ""I guess you do want to break up again"". I love him but at the same time it's painful, after the first fight he didn't talk to me for like two days I remember thinking ""if he just talks to me"". I need more than to just be acknowledged. 



So it's been confusing, one started as a fight but we calmed down and were able to talk. I said that we haven't been doing any good for the other and I don't want us changing each other. He claims he dosent try to change me but I like something he deems childish he will look down, belittle it and say I shouldn't like it, it's certainly gotten a lot less but it was very apparent before. I said I don't want to date someone racist, sexist and just mean. He said he would stop with the racist and sexist remarks but he said that in the past, stopping for a bit before blowing up on me that he won't continue to censor himself. I don't want to go through that again.


 I also said I need someone who is okay with physical contact, it's something that's really important to me but it makes him physically uncomfortable. From how I remember him describing it, he said it was a uncomfortable tingling sensation that lingers. He's told me in the past he's kept hugs and such away from me so as to not encourage bad behaviours. He told me during the conversation that'd he would Suffer through it if I could act like an adult. That's not something I want either, already I feel quilty knowing he's uncomfortable and wondering if I've been touching him too long or asking too often. He'd often act and say he dosent care anymore and that causes the fear of abandonment to come up and I use to beg him. Now I feel like I just can't leave, I won't beg but I can't leave either. Its painful being together but I remember how painful it is being away when we tried breaking up last August. Neither of us can seem to walk away and it just continues in a huge circle. Really need to vent, it's just been so confusing, I appreciate it if you took the time to read this. 


TDLR:  Toxic five year relationship on both sides, had several arguments that resulted in a break up limbo where we claim were broken up but neither can seem to actually leave."
"I (20M) am not over my ex from almost 2 years ago, what more can I do? I’ve had one other serious relationship before her and it lasted 2 years. The girl I can get over we dated for 10 months, but it was the most amazing happiest time of my life. And it’s been nearly 2 years and I’m still not over her, not fully. I don’t think about her constantly but every other day at the least she pops into my head with some great memory. We never fought or argued or anything. I know we won’t ever get back together, I don’t follow her social media, and we haven’t talked in over a year and it was just bumping into each other. What more can I do to get her off my mind? To get over her? I would almost go as far as to say I still love her, but that seems extreme. I just idk it’s the worst feeling ever. Feels like I lost the perfect one and can never get her back."
"My boyfriend just recently told me he feels like he is really struggling with everything rn so I suggested he take a break, from me and everything else Lately everything has kinda sucked for everyone. My boyfriend (21M) told me he feels like he’s lost himself and he wants to get back the hard-working person he used to be. I (19F) have always wanted what’s best for him and what he needs so after trying to get him to explain what he means he did say that he focuses too much on me compared to other things. For example would rather hangout with me then do that extra studying. So I suggested for a couple days he should just stop talking to people and playing video games he should focus on himself and what he needs/wants. He ensured me a lot that he doesn’t want this relationship to end and that he loves me, but I can’t help to think maybe I’m not what’s best for him ? Anyways the situation has kind of made me feel like I could also be more productive as we both hang out a lot (been together 14 months). Not really sure if this is a bad sign or what to feel."
"I (24 m) am not allowed to call my girlfriend (22 f) out on anything Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 3 years now, and in that time, I’ve noticed something. 

Every time I try to be assertive and tell her I didn’t like something she did or said, it somehow gets turned on me. Each time I end up feeling shitty like I did something wrong. 

She usually makes an argument out of it and cries and I don’t rush to comfort her so she uses that as fuel to make me out to be the bad guy because “I don’t care about her when she’s suffering”. 

I’ve told her multiple times that she can’t expect me to just put all of my emotions aside as well as my hurt that she made me feel (which started the whole thing) and come to her aide. 

I found out recently that her therapist agreed with me and told her that she can’t expect anything that she doesn’t ask for (she never asks for me to comfort her she just expects it). My girlfriend kept this from me for months and still, even after her therapists professional opinion does the same thing. 

Anyway, it’s really starting to boil over during this quarantine as anytime I point something out like hey, please don’t talk to me that way, you can ask politely, it turns into a melt down with me being that bad guy somehow when she could simply apologize or just say okay, I understand. 

When I talk to her about something I didn’t like she often brings up things I’ve done in the past and tries to point out every wrong I’ve ever done. It will suddenly turn into, “oh and you’re so perfect?” 

She’s very sensitive and her mother was very mean. She got scolded over the simplest things and was the “whipping boy” of her family essentially. 

My theory is that she doesn’t respond well to criticism because of that but who knows. No matter what her reasoning is it’s borderline abusive. I should be able to voice my issues without getting attacked. 

I will say that in the beginning I wasn’t the greatest communicator either, but for the last year I’ve been exemplary. I use all the buzzwords for assertive communication, I let her know I’m coming from a place of love... it just does not matter. 

She can’t handle criticism and I’m getting tired of not being able to voice myself whenever I feel she’s done something wrong or something I didn’t appreciate. 

Any opinions or advice would be great."
"I (27M) walked in on my (15F) sister masturbating. How do I make her aware that it is okay and I do not judge/think badly of her? Just for a bit of context this happened a few days ago, I tried to just let it slide but she hasn’t spoken or even texted me since (we text a lot usually, despite being in same house).

My family has recently started a daily lockdown routine where we all get together and watch the daily Coronavirus briefing (in the UK, a high ranking member of the government hosts a press briefing everyday at about 4pm). The other day, as the briefing was about to start I went upstairs to bring my sister, as she of course enjoys watching the briefings too.

I usually knock, but because it was about the time that the family would all get together and watch the daily briefing together I assumed she would be just getting ready to come downstairs. But no, I walked straight in and.....yeah.

I immediately shut the door, she reacted simply by turning away from me, I shouted “sorry (sisters name) it’s okay” and went downstairs.

I feel guilty, as not giving a 15 year old sibling adequate privacy is the first thing on my list of requirements of being a good big brother. In any case she hasn’t spoke to me since this and my parents are starting to get shifty about how we are both acting.

How do I best go about telling her that I’m sorry, that it’s okay and she doesn’t need to be ashamed/feel too awkward for too long? 

Thank you.

Edit: after reading the advice here, had an incredibly short convo where I just said I’ll knock next time (I feel we are close enough to warrant that) and then left her to get over it in her own space. I know some folks may have found this topic a little trivial, but please accept this was a first for me (never been caught myself, only
One female sibling etc) so was very awkward.

Thanks again for your advice."
"I, 28/f , lose my sense of self and Independence in relationships. Hello friends. 

I am looking for insight into why this may happen to me. For background, I do suffer from some trauma, mild depression and high anxiety. I’m not sure if this is relevant or not. 

I find that when I am single, I am quite motivated and ambitious. I strive to reach my goals and I try new things. 
However, I notice a pattern that when I’m in a relationship, I tend to lose my sense of self. I lose motivation, identity and tend to just let life “happen” to me. My SO carries the brunt of our responsibilities and is proactive in the relationship. 
I am currently with an amazing guy (3 years now) he’s in medical school, just bought us a house and we plan on getting married. However we are both a little worried about my passiveness in the relationship and tendency to be dependent. 
I really want this relationship to work, but I need to break this cycle for myself and my SO. 
I have considered moving to my hometown 2 hours away and doing a summer sublet for a few months to re-gather myself and break this cycle. He’s supportive. I don’t know if this is the right thing

Please help reddit!"
"Just found out my girlfriend has been cheating on me The other night I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me with her boy bestfriend; i've been suspicious of it for a while now but I gave her a chance to admit to it which she didnt. I was suspicious because or some of the smaller things that happened between them that I wont go into detail about, but the biggest red flags/alarm for me was him buying her doc marten shoes (£200 +), giving her his jacket, constantly talking whether its over text, call or them playing games together. On top of all that I knew he loved her but didnt think anything would come of it. Throughout me and her relationship I always, always made sacrifices to help her, make her happy and support her no matter what; even when I was in a poor mental state I always did whatever I could for her. We planned so much of our future together, our house, our wedding, our pets and even a child. I spent so much time making her sentimental things, writing her notes, writing her paragraphs, writing out my day dreams for her and so so so much more. Throughout our relationship we never argued often, it was a very rare occasion. When I woke up today I felt extremely sick, tired, stressed, worried and like my heart has been ripped out. I've been throwing up all day, I cant eat and I cant sleep (forgot to mention earlier I got 1, maybe 2 hours of sleep max last night) I had poor mental health before that happened and now its just worse. I want to cut, I want to commit and i'm sick of life. She was everything and she stabs me in the back. I just really need some support and care right now and I didn't know what other forum to go to. 
Thank you all for reading :c"
"Struggling with the end of a relationship that never got started. I feel mentally exhausted and abused. I'd really appreciate some advice please. Ok, so i (f, 37) am unhappily married with 2 children. My kids aren't babies, they're hitting their teens and I've been in a dead marriage for a long time. I've been waiting for a suitable time to end things as i myself came from a divorced home and it has caused me alot of psychological trauma as an adult. I wanted my children to be old enough to understand the situation and not feel it was their fault. 

At the beginning of the year i met someone online (m, 27) and we started chatting. For me, this wasn't going to be romance of the century, just a little escapism from my painful, dead situation i am in with my husband. It transpired that this guy had cancer and we ended up making a connection through chatting and keeping each other company online and through phone calls. I visited him in hospital and upon seeing him for the first time i knew i had developed feelings for him. These weren't just 'rip your clothes off' passion feelings, but really deep meaningful feelings. He had lost all of his hair, eyebrows and eyelashes through chemo (I've never experienced anyone with cancer before but i honestly didn't care, i just knew what i was feeling was real. I wasn't freaked out or scared, i just knew there was something there. We both quickly admitted we had feelings for one another and things were amazing. I visited him again during his chemo session and took him pizza to the hospital (drawing admiring glances from other patients who had hospital grub 😩) other times we went for luch when he wasnt too tired or too poorly and tried to make the most of our snatched time together. He told me he'd love us to get our own place once id left home, and i was over the moon...........Then things started to change.

His parents dont live in this country, so he lives with his grandparent. While he was home 'recovering' between chemo sessions he'd go down the pub with his mates and get steaming drunk (obviously, terrible for his condition) when i would ask why he'd get very defensive, then started the one and two word answers. These drink sessions would leave him crippled for days so of course i was concerned. Im not his mother, my questions wouldn't be of a nagging nature, but I'd explain that i cared and was worried. The sparse replies continued and became rather tiresome. He would refuse to answer the phone (this was done to annoy me, he admitted this) and would then go hours before replying to a message. I began to pull away as i put this behaviour down to immaturity. He started incessant messages, wanting to know why i didn't care anymore, and how I'd ""fucked him over"".
By this time lockdown had begun due to Covid-19 and it turns out that his grandparent has actually kicked him out of home for repeated breaking rules and putting himself and his grandfather at risk to see his mates to get drunk. He's now in a room at his friends place. 
During all of the texts he's been rather abusive. Calling me names like 'desperate old slag' and 'stupid bitch' 'thick idiot' he even started to call my kids because i was paying them more attention than him (he's never met them). Despite all of this i decided to give things one last go, i thought the pressure of lockdown, his illness, my marriage were all things normal couples dont experience, so i have to try.

On monday, we made headway, he opened up, i felt like we were making progress! He told me he really wanted us to work and to be a family. By Wednesday he's back to 2 word texts and abusive language. I ask him what ive done wrong and he literally explodes down the phone, to the point where i had to hang up and switch my phone off, i was so shaken.
Its over, and i know its for the best. Why do i feel so sad? I really wanted to love and care for him. I wanted to see us together but his temper literally terrified me.
Apologies for the long post, any advice would be appreciated."
"My partner (22M) broke up with me (25F) because he is not attracted to me anymore. What should I do? For almost one year, our sex life has really diminished. He rarely initiates sex, and the very few times he did it was very selfish (would finish only if I gave him head, but he wouldnt do it to me). A little while ago he broke up with me saying that he's not attracted to me anymore and that he doesn't love me anymore. During this time, he was logged into my computer and I ACCIDENTALLY caught him checking out prostitutes online. Then we got back together, he said that he never said he wasn't attractive to me in the first place (which he fucking did). For that one night, he looked very into me. And then he started treating me really poorly again. I asked him whats wrong and why he's been acting like a jerk to me lately, and finally he admitted that it was because he didnt find me attractive anymore, and that is due to my weight gain. During the 1st year of our relationship I was around 189lbs (5'3''), after the first year I lost 70lbs and now I started gaining it back. I dont think I look bad, because I go to the gym at least 5 times a week and eat healthy. I dont have abs, but I do not look bad, I actually think I am pretty hot. Now it's the 4th year of the relationship and I am around 157lbs. I am slowly losing it back but it will take time. I have been his ride or die during all this time, I dont understand why he would break up over such a thing, especially if I am putting in the effort and I have results?! I think I am more active than he is, our bodies are just different. But also, what if I get pregnant? Or sick? Will he just dump my ass because of the extra weight and look for prostitutes online?  
Is it worth working  on this issue with him or should we just break up? Is this a serious red flag?"
"My boyfriend barely initiates sex with me I think he prefers watching porn. We've been together for almost a year I always ask him if he wants me to so something different or what he likes so it's not as if I don't give him options or satisfy his needs. He watches porn almost every day and then he will lie to me about having done it without me, even though I know he has. I don't mind if he watches porn but i feel kinda weird cause I'm right here and I've told him multiple times that i don't mind if he tells me and we can do it whenever he wants. He said he didn't realise he could tell me whenever hes in the mood which feels like an excuse. I just feel like I'm not good enough or that I do something wrong? Most of the times it's me initiating things and I have no problem with that but he will still watch porn even after we've just had sex when I leave the room. It's just bugging me cause I don't know how to feel about it. I love him and he's a very nice guy we have plenty of fun together and we have connected emotionally I feel very comfortable talking to him but I just dont think I'm good enough on that part."
"Found out that my ex sexually abused his sister. EDIT: Pretty overwhelming response and I realise now that I did the wrong thing and failed this poor girl. I am about to go to the police station with my mum, and tell them everything, including some incriminating texts I found in old chats. If anyone would like an update feel free to message me. I know my post did not get that many responses but some people asked for an update, so that's why I included this edit. I appreciate everyone's support, and I am very grateful that you have all been here to help me.

I (19f) have an ex (21m) who I have been separated from for a while now. We broke up due to him cheating on me with a minor, however the extent of his immorality and sexual perversion is much darker than I realised. 

During our relationship, I became very close with his younger sister who was around 5 when I was dating him. We broke up 2 years ago, so she is around 7 now. I was close with his mother, as well as his sister, so I ended up going to his mother's house even after our breakup (he does not live with his mother). 

During one of these visits, his sister confided in me that he had sexually abused her. She said that it was when she was younger (bear in mind she is already as young as 5..) and that he sodomized her with his hands. She obviously did not word it like this, but I don't want to be graphic. I immediately did everything I could to comfort her, but in all truth I had no idea what I was meant to say. I just told her that she did the right thing by telling me and that I would never ever let this happen to her again. I cuddled her until she slept and then went to tell her mother (I didn't want to leave her alone, but felt this shouldn't have been discussed in front of her). Her mother broke down, and after around an hour of her crying and me trying to comfort her, she (politely, we did not fall out) asked me to leave.

I texted my ex's mother the next day to let her know I was there for them both in any way I could be. My ex's younger sister had begged her mother not to tell the police, and in turn in ex's mother then begged me not to, so I didn't.. I don't know if this was the right thing to do. My ex is never allowed to be alone with his sister now, but I know they still see each other. This all feels so wrong to me, but I don't know if I'm right or not? Is there anything I should do? I don't know if I handled this correctly? I know I'm not a kid, but I'm pretty young and have never experienced this sort of thing, I just don't know how I was meant to react and what I was meant to do? I feel scared for her still. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I know this may be above reddits paygrade but I just don't know where else to turn for advice. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this. Seriously, thank you."
"I(23) need help to communicate with my mom (57) I (23 NB) am probably autistic. The only reason I wasn't diagnosed (and my therapists who can't diagnose me said it's highly likely but a doctor who diagnoses adults here costs lots of money, I heard lots of ableist stuff like I don't need a dx because I'm ""too competent"" to need one from many bad professionals that refused to spend more than 10 minutes hearing me) as a kid was because of my family's religion; My  mom(57F) took me to religious therapies and therapeuts when I was a kid whenever I had any mood problems. Most would say I was just a indigo child and whatever. I hated touches and since I was a baby I attacked anyone who tried to touch me. I heard some stuff like stimming being bad, and my meltdowns were always labeled as demonic possessions or the like, or that I was drugged when I never took anything of the kind in my life. I was smarter than other kids, in that I never had many problems with grades even if I never actually understood much of what I was doing and was only memorizing and following orders received, always had problems communicating with people and my family's overprotection never allowed me to bond with other people at all. I wasn't allowed to go to other peoples houses if we werent related, neighbours or had the same religion and the likes, and even them while my sister(28F) was always allowed to go to travels to pool, music shows, beach and stuff with them, I never was. Even as a adult they won't allow me to do stuff my sister was allowed when she was 15. Like, I needed to be 19 to be allowed to watch a movie in the cinema by myself and I only watched animation movies in the theater so it was only because no one wanted to watch the movie with me. I also have many specific interests and can't do stuff that doesn't interest me at all (Like I can only watch animated movies, live action movies bore me a lot and I cant focus in them. I learned english to be able to read more about my special interest in pokemon), a low empathy with most subjects and excessive in others. Anyway. I got older, discovered about autism in my college and a lot clicked with me, and due to my sister, got to a therapist that wasn't religious. Anyway, I'm depressive but can't take any meds bc the doctors I went to said I don't need them, and that my lack of energy, will to live would be solved with regular therapy.

Alright, about my mom. She is very clingy and needy and I never felt comfortable near her because she knows I hate touches, and she still is touchy. I told her tickles make me have a meltdown(before I called this state ""out of control"" because I actually thought I was being possessed) and I hate them and she still kept tickling me until a few years ago when I broke a table in my meltdown when I was trying to escape tickling and hurt her and everyone in home complained about me and my agressiveness for days, as always, I was in the wrong. She always judged my interests, said I needed to mature and never tried to pay attention to them. My dad(57M) and my sister always listened to me at least. I also feel she might be narcissistic or have a mental illness besides her diagnosed depression and anxiety (she's very paranoid, often transfers her traumas to my dad and turns him into a villain of sorts when he's one of the nicest people I've ever meet, always think she's a victim, resorts to guilt trips often, is very close minded, and untrusting of others and all the times she said she saw like, a demon besides me when I had a meltdown also make me think of this), but because of her religion, she'll never accept this, since once someone suggested something about like, a psychotic episode, when she was acting weird and she left the doctor offended and never came back. I find her extremely hard to talk and while I don't think she's a bad person, I think she might need more than depression medicine and therapy for it to be easier for us to interact and I don't know how to bring this up, specially now in quarantine. Religion was always her therapy and while not the best, it was something. Now she can't go there anymore and fought with her friends when they tried to do online stuff so now she feels alone but she doesn't seem to understand my boundaries and feels personally attacked when I refuse to give hugs or kisses but I hate doing these. Today's mother's day, and I haven't even got out of my room because I don't know what to do. How to interact with my mom. I can't contact my therapist because of the quarantine either and don't have really anyone to talk about this to.

TL;DR: How do I interact with someone who refuses to listen what I say and doesn't respect my boundaries and has a complicated mental health when I already have problems interacting with people? Not interacting only makes stuff worse as time passes and is no option...

(also please don't post this on twitter cause my sister might be able to find it out there)"
"Should I message my ex during this quarantine/ r.i.p self respect. So my ex and I parted ways mutually and promised each other not to interfere or contact each other for 3-4 years. 
Although I did text her an year ago, she was very rude to me..
But I am getting sudden urges to check on her, how she is and talk a litt she ain't gonna message for sure.
Should I message her and talk although my self respect will just hit the bottomline for the sake of talking ?"
"I’m (28m) no longer attracted to my girlfriend (26f) but I feel trapped in the relationship. How do I end this? We’ve been together for ~2.5 years and live together. About 6 months ago I got a promotion and it meant relocating, we talked about how life would change if I took the job ie: long distance, turn down job, or both relocate. I didn’t want to turn down the job, she veto’d long distance. So we relocated together, I’m the one with the job and she’s mainly staying at home.

I find that while I enjoy her company, I’m not sexually attracted to her and I don’t feel as strongly about us as I did before. Living together has made me realize that I don’t want to be in the relationship. 

Here’s the dilemma: she relocated for me (8hr drive, 2hr flight) and has prioritized my wants over hers. She gave up her career, she gave up her friends, we have a life together. If we breakup, it means I just have to find another partner but she has to find an apartment, a job, friends, probably re-relocate. Breaking up with her pre-relocation would have been the best thing to do, but now there is a moral dilemma: “breakup with her and you ruined her life, so stick it out.” 

TL:DR - girlfriend relocated with me to another state, now I want out of the relationship, how do I do this?"
Bad friend or not? Hola! My friend has been dropping all of their emotional baggage on me and I keep on giving advice and comforting them but they don't seem to listen. These sessions have been so uncomfortable lately esp during this pandemic. Am I a bad friend for feeling this way? What would you do?
"My wife and our sons relationship is headed for disaster, is there anything I can do? I (29F) am married to a woman (30F) who is a very intellectual type of person. Our son (5M) is a standard 5 year old with a love of all things trucks. Recently my wife and I got into an argument because I was trying to mitigate the problems that come with her being tired (was wanting my brother to mow our lawn). When she's tired she's cranky and snaps at everyone and is sarcastic with our kiddo. She got upset and said things like it hasn't escaped her notice that she is mean and angry and the only thing that helps her feel better is that maybe it's related to how she was treated as a kid. 

The next day, she came to me and told me she feels bad because she finds him boring; that in fact she finds most people boring. She hates playing with him and feels like the only thing she knows how to do it ""teach"" him. Her teaching is more like constantly correcting him and telling him what not to do. It's very frustrating for them both. She spends many evenings having him help her pick up the house while telling him that there goes their play time and if he would just pick up after himself they wouldn't have to be doing that. 

The next day she told me she was going to stop focusing so much on her side project and focus more on other things (her project was constantly on her mind and she always felt like she was waiting to do it). That night, I started bedtime because she was in the bathroom and was likely to be for a while. She came in mid way and as far as I'm away they had a good time.

The day after that, yesterday, I did bedtime after she spent all of her play time with our son working on a Facebook comment and a little bit dealing with his toe injury (he's fine, just stubbed it).  When it was actually bed time, she was still working on the Facebook comment and told him he could stay up until she was done. She claims it would only take 5 minutes, but that's not exactly set in stone or valuable enough to have him stay up. Beyond that he and asked me to go with him for bedtime so I did. Once we were there he told me he didn't want to do bedtime with her because she doesn't like playing with him. 

Is there any way to fix this? Am I wrong that something needs to change?"
"They way my (32M) girlfriend (32F) of 1 year broke up with me makes me feel worthless as a human being. How can I fix this? I was essentially 'living' with her for around a year. Since she lived 4-hours away, I basically stayed at her place the entire time. I just worked it out. I think there was about 40-50 days that I didn't spend there over the course of a year.

In April, she had her electricity cut off and she was evicted. There is nothing I or her could have done about this. It was an issue related to her mum (since it is technically her mum's apartment), and if her mum doesn't play ball (and she doesn't), nothing could be fixed.

Of course, at the same time, my girlfriend's income fucked up. She is meant to get some sort of allowance to 'work' because of her diagnosed ADHD, complex PTSD and social anxiety. Because everybody was trying to get payments at the same time (due to COVID-19) and half the staff being off of work, she received a grand total of one payment in a month. For the whole month, she was expected to live on 1/10th of what she normally gets.

Of course, I did the best I could. I got a library card, and spent 16 hours a day working in the library. During that time, I paid for all of our food and any bills that she needed to get paid so the situation didn't get worse. I have never been so fucking stressed in my life. I work freelance, and due to my job, there is less work coming in at the moment as companies don't have whopping marketing budgets to deal with. I was essentially paying the expenses of two people on an income that had halved overnight.

She didn't want to come to where I live, because her ex lives here and bumping into him would make things a WHOLE lot worse for her, so I couldn't do much on the whole living situation front.

It was stressful. I got annoyed a little as she wasn't really helping. I would work. Come home to take a break, and she would be all ""didn't you get me anything at the shop then?"". So, obviously, I would have to walk all the way down and get her food. I supported the cat etc. Hell, I paid bills she was meant to cancel but 'forgot' to cancel (this means paying for phone and broadband bills). I was on the go. She wouldn't go to the shop. Would never tell me what she wanted, so I had to guess (but she would then complain I was making her eat unhealthily)

The day after she got her money, she asked me to leave so she could destress. This was after she promised me she would help pay for me throughout May because I helped her so much in April. I don't need it, but it wouldn't go amiss. I mean, spending money on pre-prepared foods and takeaway gets really expensive (we didn't have an oven, obviously). She did NOT give me any money. She just said to leave. She said this wasn't her breaking up with me. She just needed to destress and start focusing on where she was going to live.

I went back, and apart from a 9-minute phone conversation, she didn't speak to me at all. I understand. She couldn't charge her phone. After about a week of getting back she sent me a single message on Facebook saying:

""I have decided to be single""

This was at 3:30am. She then proceeded to ignore me for almost 12-hours. Like, leaving me on read. No explanation other than that line. No other communication. Nothing. When she finally called she said ""I don't love you in the right way any more"" and that was that.

The thing is that the reason she stopped 'loving me' was due to something that happened in October. I had old pictures of my ex stored on my dropbox. Well, not of my ex, of things I did with my ex. People save photos. It was part of my history and it was the first time I really felt like I had friends. Apparently, this was disrespectful to her, and she deleted all photos of my past. So, really I have nothing left of anything I have done. I also no longer have a girlfriend due to a stupid mistake I made.

She also said I wasn't supportive in her being evicted. Well, I am sorry. I could only be so supportive. I had to work almost double my normal hours to fund food, bills etc. because of the situation. I tried to look for new places to live. I didn't have time to do anything else. But, apparently, I wasn't very 'fun' around this time.

I feel like I have been used the past 7 months. Somebody saying she loves me, getting money etc. and promising to marry me one day etc. and it is ALL undone in a single text message.

I don't really deserve this, and I feel as if people don't really care about my feelings. Like, how could anybody think it is possibly fine to do that via text? She doesn't even want me to come collect my stuff until she is less stressed about being evicted. So, I am stuck for the next 2-weeks (and I am 2-weeks in) with two pairs of jeans, three t-shirts, and 2 pairs of underwear. I was expected to go back within 2-days of leaving, but nope. Now I have zero clothes.

Am I really worthless? Did I do something wrong I am not spotting?

TL;DR: I feel like less of a human because a girlfriend of 1-year broke up with me via text."
"10 year sexual routine Hi I’m (28M) first time posting on reddit. My wife (26F) and I have been together for ten years. I don’t regret marrying her at all I love her. I do feel like since we have been together for so long we have fallen into a sexual routine. 

We have been trying to have a baby and have been having sex everyday we can. 

We also have started to use a lubricant because, according to her, saliva slows the sperm down from making it to her egg. We have a little oral sex sometimes in the shower but she feels like there’s is no emotional connection when we do that. She also does not like the way my breath smells after I go down on her. 

This is a little embarrassing but we only have sex in 2 positions. Missionary and cowgirl. Everything else seems to be painful for her . 

I have always been attracted to my wife but for some reason now I feel like having sex is still fun but it’s harder for me to get into it.  

The other night we went to do the same old routine 
1) take a shower together
2) 30 second blowjob 
3) get out of the shower brush our teeth 
4) have sex in bed with lube

By the time we got to 4 It was difficult for me to get a rock hard erection. I had a good erection in the shower but by step 4 I feel like we had to restart. 

My wife is very timid when it comes to this stuff so it’s hard to talk about it without hurting her feelings. I want to make her feel sexy and beautiful but idk what to tell her when I am soft."
"Feeling like a second choice I am with a girl, and she is bestfriends with her ex, they broke up about a year ago but dated 10 or so years. Anyways, they have a level of trust and closeness that intimidates me and makes me feel like a second pick. We've known each other for about 8-9 months now, and I understand that reaching that level will take time for she and I, but it still feels shitty, also they seem to have issues with boundaries, (nothing like kissing, but sometimes the guy puts his arm around her etc etc.) She says she didnt think about how that could come off as inapproproate, but it makes me think that maybe she doesnt have enough space for me. We have also talked about this before, and she says its completely platonic, but I just feel like a second pick i guess. I also know thats a shitty thing to do to someone, make them pick between two people and i would never ask her to do that, but thats just how it feels. Is it always gonna feel like this? I imagine they are gonna be friends forever."
"I (16F) am having problems with my current boyfriend (18 M) and ex-boyfriend (17M) One. Please do not say anything about my age or there age. 

Two. The Problem:
Before my current boyfriend, I was obviously dating my ex who broke up with me during a mental break down he was having. I was hurt because this was the first relationship where I actually started to love the guy. (I was only in one previous to my ex) It took me a little while to get over him but me being stupid I started dating my current boyfriend even though I wasn't coming over my ex. After a while I did and my current boyfriend and I have been doing great. My ex and I stayed friends but we don't live near each other so we don't see other often. 
  
The other day I got a text from ex saying hi after a month of not talking and ended up telling me he still loved me. Old feelings and nostalgia started flooding back. Then my ex's friend called me telling me how horrible my ex's life had gotten after he broke up with me, how I was his favorite out of all his girlfriends, and to remember the good times. I feel so confused right now but I love my current boyfriend. My head is spinning and I dont know what to do because I dont want to hurt anyone. 

My ex and I have been talking for about a week and I don't know what to do. Anyone have any advice? Please and thank you"
"what do guys think about love letters? I messed a good thing up with the right person. I didnt cheat or do anything bad but i pushed this person out of my life, and really hurt their feelings. I feel so terrible because this guy didn’t deserve it and already had trust issues before i came along. With that said, we had such a good realationship, we were open, honest, and had a ton of fun together. Ive never felt this way about anybody before so i reached out to him in attempt to make amends and maybe try again? So far i can see that he does want to try again, and he does miss me too. But i think he is having doubts (which i understand). I wrote him a letter, telling him how i felt about him and how i felt i had really messed up. Im going back and forth if i should give it to him, or let him have his space and let him come to me. My thought on it, is that i dont think it could hurt anything, but i also dont want to seem pushy. What do you guys think?"
"(20M) My Gf (20F) misinterprets my asexuality as me losing interest in her Title says it all. She thinks I don't love her anymore because we haven't had sex for a while now. I've just been really busy to me and to us asexuals, sex could feel more like a chore sometimes. 

Don't get me wrong, I love my girlfriend very much. I haven't told her about my asexuality yet though because I'm afraid she'll think I'm weird and that I need some medical help, which most people I've told felt. I might even lose her. 

I just thought I could act that I'm not asexual while I'm with her but I'm getting tired of it. I feel like cracking and just opening up every now and then but I back out at the last minute out of fear. 

Should I tell her or should I just keep acting? I'm also worried that she might think I'm lying about my asexuality and that it's just another excuse. If so, I'd have dug myself into a bigger hole."
"I (26f) suggested open marriage to husband (29m) and now he wants a divorce. Need help! I thought that he was an open person, willing to discuss almost everything so this is very shocking to me. I asked him if he would like to try out open relationship and he said just no. I asked him why is that and he replied that 'I don't want it, end of discussion.'

Everything was fine after that for couple of months. I thought that maybe he has mulled things over and be ready to discuss my needs so I tried to open up the dialogue with him by telling him that it does not mean that I don't love you anymore or that I would be leaving him if that is what you are afraid of.

He just told me that he will not do that, went to stay in his new investment flat and did not want to talk to me. Today he said that he wants a divorce and he is not willing to discuss.

What can I do to let him know that I still want to be married to him? Anything? Help me please."
"My (F18) boyfriend (M21) wants to pay me for porn videos of myself Hey everyone. I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 months now. He is really kind, sweet and gives back to the world a lot. He’s really amazing with his family and usually respectful. However, lately i’ve seen a “side” to him sexually that I don’t know how to take in. 

We are currently long distance at the moment, so he’s begun asking for videos of myself masturbating nearly every single day, or asking for photos of myself everyday. I do not have a high sex drive, probably due to a sexual assault that happened to me when I was 13. He knows this happened to me, but still continues. I’ve told him about 2 times that i’m uncomfortable and feel he’s a bit too forceful. He always says he is sorry and immediately follows it up with an “I love you”.

But this is the side I really don’t like now. A few days ago he’s started to offer me money in exchange for a “3-5 minute long video of you using toys”. I feel uncomfortable with this, and I have told him as such. He promised to work on it, but I don’t know if the damage is already done or what not. It almost feels like a bribe? I don’t know. He always apologizes. He is really a good guy. I care a lot about him, and I can see that he loves me, but sometimes I question his love because I don’t feel respected when he’s like this. Granted, he’s not horny all the time. But I’d say very often. And he’s offered to pay 30$ every day for a video. I haven’t accepted his offer.

A week ago, he asked for a video of me stripping. I didn’t want to do it, not because I wasn’t in the mood but because i’m uncomfortable with my body, and I didn’t want to show my face. I did do it and send it to him, even though my gut was aching the whole time. I am uncomfortable with a lot of sexual things due to my PTSD, but that is something i’m working on and he knows that. I just felt like I didn’t want to let him down, and I truly care about him. So my question is, since we care about each other, is this worth fighting for? Is it something worth working through as a couple or should I cut my losses? I really don’t have anyone else to ask, so Reddit is my last hope, really. I just feel lost.

TL;DR my boyfriend offers to pay for sex videos of myself, I am uncomfortable and have PTSD and he knows. I’ve told him he’s too forceful and he’s apologized but keeps asking. Is it worth it to salvage this?

Edit: I broke up with him and he’s “sorry i think he’s a terrible person” not sorry that he is one."
"Love triangle help?    
I am a 30 year old guy who fell for a 22 y.o. girl.

She lied that she was single in the beginning, then reunited with her ex. Now she's seeing us both. It's been 3 months of this crap. He doesn't know.

I told her to choose one of us, she says she can't leave him because she's attached, she can't leave him without a fight and everything's fine, bla bla. She continues to keep me on the hook, give me hopes.

Should I tell him his girl has long been cheating on him, I got pics of cuddles and kisses?

Have you had any similar personal experience? Maybe one that had a happy end?

"Losing interest in my LDR and im not sure what to do. How do I keep it interesting? I’ve been in a LDR with my boyfriend for about 2 years now. We met on here and clicked right away. We have great chemistry and he’s literally like my other half. He lives 8 hours away and we’ve met up and spent days together a number of times and over all its been pretty great. We’ve talked about moving in together more than I can count and it seemed like a great idea. I actually saw myself being with him for the rest of my life. I wanted that. We decided to make moving in happen this year. We budgeted together, apartment hunted together, and finally found the one. We applied and an hour later we got accepted. It could not have been more perfect. Our move in date was June 1st. I couldn’t wait to finally be with him. 

Yesterday morning I received a text from him telling me he wanted to cancel to lease asap. With everything going on he said we wouldn’t be able to find job and that he refused to move forward until we had job lined up. Even though we has saving he didn’t wanna do it. 

That’s completely understandable.. I get that. But the problem is he told me he had been feeling that way for weeks. But i feel like he lead me on. We would count down the days with me until move in, we’d shop for the apartment over FaceTime. And talk about what life would be like once we we’re finally together. And the whole time we were doing that, he didn’t wanna move in with me. 

I feel like maybe I’m over reacting. But I just feel absolutely broken. And I feel like im losing interest in a LDR all together. It was easier when we had a plan but now its hard because I dont know when or if it will actually ever happen. There are a lot of other factors that could stop us from moving in the future, and it will be harder to meet up because of the virus plus I work full time everyday.  

Im just tired of doing everything over the phone. Tired of never being able to see the person im in a relationship with. And it just feels like it’s never going to happen now. Sorry this is just some big rant. 

But how can you keep a LDR alive when everything becomes old and out done. Im just getting bored of our online routine. And I feel terrible that I feel that way, but thats just how I feel. I love him, but I feel like im losing interest in the distance and Im not sure what to do."
"Are marriages really a real thing?? 38 female—— a lot of ample time to think beyond the text due to our current world situation.....

Each one of us carries an Oscar worthy story about our lives—trust me we do....

I was married— madly deeply in love —- then woke up to this itch around the age of 32—- why do we have to compromise who we are, how we identify our true selves, in marriage—- we are supposed to take one another as is —— but how is that possible —- 

For example —- I am not an outdoors person—- the guy I fell in love with is— he loves me for me and accepts that——NOT TEN YEARS LATER, IT IRKS HIM—-is it his fault - no—- is it my fault— no ... so he compromises — but then that compromise turns into another complaint ...:

So my question is—- is there such a thing as a sincerely content happy marriage— where one doesn’t lose their true selves and both parties are okay???????

I’m beginning to think there isn’t —- because I’m the criminal and the victim of hating someone’s interests or whatever and someone hating mine .... I sound all over the place .... 

Is being single the answer to all problems???"
"My suicidal girlfriend is posting cries for help but refusing to talk to me I made some posts earlier about how my long distance (different countries) girlfriend (f23) has been very suicidal the past few days and is just pushing me away when I try to reach out to her. I know this may not be the best sub for topics related to mental illness, but I'll give it a try.

So well, she's very suicidal and depressed. I've been trying to talk to her, be there for her, show her that I'm here to listen etc. But she just keeps saying she wants to isolate, says ""no"" when I ask her if we can talk, what's going on etc... But despite this, she's currently spamming what I'd call  ""cries for help"" on social media. I mean literally pics of her crying and sad/depressed captions??? I don't understand why the hell she's doing this. I'm trying so god damn hard to be there for her but she refuses to talk to me, and instead she posts these kind of things? I'm really worried about her, and I also feel inadequate because it feels she wants to talk to anyone but me.

Could someone please help me understand what's going on and what I should do???"
"ThrowRA Sister (34F) confronts me (27M) about being distant while she's drunk/high Throwaway account, 

With quarantine going on it's been stressful for everyone, but in particular for my sister (34F). In March like many Peace Corps volunteers, she was evacuated out of her station and sent home. When this happened my Mom and Dad both asked me (27M) if I would take her in for two weeks since they are both over 60 and we didn't want them to potentially be exposed to the COVID-19 since my sister was traveling a long distance. When my sister was at my apartment I just tried to be as understanding and accomodating as I could. If she was having a bad day I would talk with her, cook, whatever she needed to process being evacuated. While my sister was living with me during this time I was furloughed at work and we both decided it would be nice for the family to be closer together about six weeks into her living with me. So we both pack up our stuff and go back to our parents. 

Last week, while we both are home my sister had a google hangout party with her friends where she was drinking. I'm not sure how much she was drinking, but my sister was on this video party call for about 4-5 hours with them. I didn't really mind and thought it's great that she is having social interaction since we all need to. The time is about midnight and I want to smoke weed, so I get pretty stoned and decided to make some food. While I'm eating my food my sister finished her video call and see's me stoned out of my mind. She then wants to smoke to and I tell her where my weed stash is at and she smokes. My sister comes back and asks me if I'm ready to talk. I wasn't sure what the hell was going on, but I said sure, I can talk. She then tells me that I've changed since we've both been back home with our parents. Telling me that I'm distant and don't really hang out with her anymore and want to know more about what is going on. I tell her that this quarantine is a roller coaster and that we are all going through problems. I said I was sorry I was being distant, but she wanted to know more about my personal life. I was pretty caught off guard and wasn't sure how to answer this. I felt like while I gave her space, time, and understanding, and she just kind of gave me the middle finger wanting to know more about my personal life and problems. I understand we are family, but if I'm not comfortable sharing things with them then do I have to? I guess how she handled this as well wasn't my favorite part, doing this drunk and high after midnight doesn't sit well with me. How do I handle this? Should I talk with her about it? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I take my sister after being evacuated from the peace corps giving her space when she needs it and take care of her. When we move home to our parents she confronts while she is high and drunk telling me I've changed since we have been home and she wants to know what is going on. I feel like since I gave her space and understanding and she isn't doing the same."
"Boyfriend(M27) said his ex(F?) was the last person he ever loved on social media that I don’t follow. What do I do? I’ve (25F) been in a relationship with my bf (27M) for 2 years. When we first got together, he was vocal about not sharing social media info in relationships because in the past it has “ruined his relationships.” I didn’t think much of it because he was the kind of guy to just lay everything out on the table upfront, which I initially appreciated. We were long distance (6 hour drive) for most of our relationship but due to the pandemic hitting my area really hard, I’ve been living with him for the past 2 months.

A year into the relationship, I found his Facebook account (out of boredom) and read his content. He has lots of friends on his page and they interact a lot. There was a status that I was concerned about that he insinuated that he was having sex with other women. He got upset at the fact that his social media was found, then explained to me that I misinterpreted the status. After this, I never looked at his profile again because honestly, it hurt more to read that more than anything. We worked through this and were good for months after. 

During this time together, we’ve had fights, but for the most part, everything has been good. Yesterday, we had a fight and disrespected me he told me to “go away.” This became a huge argument and he denied that he disrespected me. So I left his house and came home. 

I know I made a lot of mistakes within the conversation that escalated up to this point, so I sent him a text to apologize this morning to take accountability for what I said and for acting impulsively (this is my first relationship so I’m still learning things). He did not reply, he just read it.

Shortly after, I was thinking about him and gave into weakness and looked at his profile again. This time, I don’t think I can recover. I read a status from a week ago to one of his friends saying that his ex is the last person he’s ever loved, and ever since, he’s been closed off completely to love. The ex he’s talking about is not me; he mentioned a certain feature of hers that I do not at all have.


We have been together for two. years. My heart is shattered from reading this, and I hate I did this to myself. I really want to mention that I saw it to him, but I KNOW it will mark the real final end of our relationship because it will definitely turn into an argument about me looking at his profile. Throughout this relationship, I’ve tried to silence my ego, as lots of our arguments came from my insecurities. I’m madly in love, but I can not be stupid twice.

What do I do?

TL;DR: Pretty much the title."
"My partner is upset about feeling invisible. How can I be helpful and supportive? My partner is upset about feeling invisible when in social situations. Being social distancing now, we are on zoom and he is often talked over or his presence isn’t acknowledged and I just want to help him feel better. The trouble is he’s quiet (in his demeanour) and doesn’t like to be the centre of attention. When he wants to tell a story, he’ll often get me to tell it for him and I don’t know where this stems from, possibly from him wanting the story to be noticed? I’m extroverted and a bit loud, though I end up being talked over sometimes too. How can I help? What can I say? What advice can I give?"
"My (22m) gf (20f) talks about sexual stuff with her guy friend Hey my girlfriend befriended my friend, they're friends now. And she told him some sexual stuff, her preferences and etc. The way she used to masturbate and these kind of things. it bothers me and i don't know  if its appropriate for gf to tell guy friend these kind of things."
"Girlfriend (23) sharing custody of dog with ex I'm in a long distance relationship where my girlfriend broke up with her ex of two years, moved out, but shares custody of her dog with her ex, swapping every week.

We've been together for a few months, and (guilty enough) she actually cheated on this same ex with me because of certain issues, knowing she wants to pursue something with me.

We had an argument about where we should move which resulted in her going back with her ex the very next day, only for her to realize a week later that it wasn't the same, and that she loved me and wants to be with me. This was the point where my trust went out the window because instead of talking it out like I had tried to with her, she ignored me for a week, trying to work things out with her ex in the meantime.

Now, in present time, I tell her that I'm not comfortable with her sharing the dog. I tell her that there's trust that needs to be regained and that I'd be more comfortable if the time between pick ups and drop offs were more spread apart (such as biweekly, not weekly). She responded that she made that mistake, and she's trying to prove herself, but I need to get over it and it's like I'm not giving her a chance. That it's for the dog and not for her, that she doesn't want to be with him, she loves me. And also that it's unfair to him to do that.

I love her, I do, and if she hadn't went back to her ex after our argument I would've been more accepting of the situation, but... she did go back to him.

Am I in the wrong for feeling this way? What should I do?"
"Neighbors leave dog outside 24/7, and the barking is becoming unbearable. Moved into a new community over a year ago, quickly became friendly acquaintances with neighbors next door who are about the same age as us. We’ve interacted with them several times, and see each other often. We originally built a fence around our house, And only until recently did they enclose their yard as well. The thing is, after enclosing their yard, they now leave their small dog outside 24/7. Sweltering heat, pouring rain, it doesn’t matter— he’s staying out there. Their yard has no shade or shelter for him. And he barks all day and all night long and even wakes us up. Normally, we’d have no problem calling someone out on this, but we don’t really know what to do in this situation.  We will likely be their neighbors for quite a long time and want to maintain a friendly relationship. What’s the best way to go about this? 

TL;DR Neighbors built fence, leave barking dog outside 24/7 with no shelter. Waking us up at night and annoying af during the day. What can we do?"
"My (20F) fiance (24M) has had thoughts of breaking up with me but never pushes through with it Right now, I am emotionally a mess. Due to recent events, the virus, people are supposed to stay inside. Fortunately, I live with my fiance and his family. 

He and I had an ugly fight a couple of nights ago. He brought up so many things why he was mad at me and when he told me that he wants to speak to me in private I have always been afraid of going in without a fuss because either way there would be physical violence mainly coming from him. 

He has made it abundantly clear to me that he does not love me. What he wants is a slave who will cook, clean, do everything for him, and satosfy every need he has without being irritating, annoying, or talkative. 

He has hurt me deeply. I have deactivated my social media but I reactivated it due to work purposes and to contact my father as well. I noticed that he removed the engaged relationship status and removed his engagement ring. I feel like the only reason he's telling me that he wants to keep me in his life was because I had a pregnancy scare again and he told me that he's already sick of taking care of me. 

Would I be wrong to leave after the lockdown and break off all communication with him?"
"My parents are allowing my (17m) grandparents and other relatives to travel halfway across the United States for my birthday at the end of the month, how do I convince them this is a horrible idea? I don't know why but they keep insisting ""at some point you gotta move on"" and ""what else are we gonna do, not see them for years until there's a vaccine?"" And no matter how much I say I don't want them to catch covid just to come for my birthday they keep insisting it'll be fine but I would feel absolutely destroyed of any of my family got sick and died just to come to my birthday. How do I convince my parents that this is a horrible horrible idea and that they should at least wait a while?"
Me(17f) Hates touch. My family doesn’t care. My family is a pretty touchy and I’m not. It’s mostly my dad and older brother. They don’t understand why I don’t like to be touched. I have nerve and chronic pain that makes hugs and touching in general painful. (And I have explained this to them multiple times)They’ll touch me as they walk past me or even sometimes grab me and hug me without warning. I try to push them off me and say no. Which usually lead them holding me tighter causing more pain. Which leads me to yelling at them to stop. Which leaves the pissed off at me. Telling me to get over myself and maybe learn how to like hugs. They have called me pathetic multiple time. I don’t know what else to do at this point. What should I say to them to get them to stop touching me?
"I [28F] have been talking to this guy [35M] online but I just found out that he's been cheating I started talking to this guy on Kik about two years ago (early 2018). He's from the UK while I'm from the US. We made it clear that it was all just fun, just lots of flirting and fooling around. It lasted a while, about 6 months. We shared photos and videos, some of these showing parts of faces. And while we did have some chats that were serious, we were both adamant on not pursuing anything more serious. Eventually, we stopped speaking towards the end of 2018. We were both starting at new jobs, I moved to a new country, and we just got busy that we lost touch. I then deleted the app. 

Fast forward to March 2020, I'm bored because of the quarantine and I download the app again to see if he might still be on there. He was. I said hi and we started talking again. Our previous arrangement still stood and we had so much fun. Now, because of this arrangement, I never really bothered to look him up. To me, he was just some guy online to have fun with. Relevant to mention that I am quite averse to social media but I do have a Twitter and a LinkedIn. 

I mentioned him to some friends and they, not being averse to social media, looked him up. They find his Facebook and photos of him with a girl with some photos having timestamps at around the time that we were speaking. One of the girl's photos showed her wearing an engagement ring. I'm not sure if they are/were engaged but still. I was so angry. He was cheating on this lovely woman with me. I felt so dirty. I confronted him about it and he admitted to it. They are not in a relationship at mo he said but I really don't buy it. He apologized, said that he has no excuse, he was weak, and because our arrangement was that nothing was real it didn't count. Mega eyeroll here from me.

Now, I want to do something about this. I hate that I've been made a participant and I hate that he'd do this to her. I want to reach out to the girl and tell her about this. Should I? Also, I don't have a Facebook so would I have to make one to be able to send her a message? How do I go about this?"
"We broke up I feel horrible, we broke up. Because I was too clingy and attached to her. 
I always wanted to show her how much I love her and that I want to provide and give her all my support and love. Didn't realized that slowly it turned me into a needy and clingy person and it kept going like this for so long. 

She said it was suffocating her and though it was an unattractive, and that's mainly the reason why we have to broke up.

I still love her. If there are small chances just to be with her again, with a new me, a better version of myself. I'll take it. I want to be with her again.. 
I wonder if that is possible.."
"I (24F) overheard my roommate (24F) tell her mentor that my job wasn’t hard at all. She flipped the argument on me. Title doesn’t really explain the whole thing. My roommate and I are engineers at the same company but different streams. I’ve never said anything about her job not being hard as I know her job is just as, if not more, difficult as mine.

She was talking to her mentor on the phone and I was in the same room and out of nowhere said “petty_squad’s job isn’t that hard” after she knows I just had the toughest week. I simply walked into my room, shut my door, and locked it. 

Of course she came over and tried to talk. I told her she had no business discrediting my job to somebody higher up in the company and she tried to turn it around like it was my fault. Every time we fight she makes it about me and expects me to apologize for stuff I didn’t do.  I’m getting tired of it."
"How to kick husband out during quarantine? I’ve suspected my husband of cheating for a while now but never had any proof other than some text messages between him and another female. Recently started feeling off “down there” and wouldn’t you know it I have an STI. After 5 years of  marriage, together 10 and one child. I can’t even look at him. He swears up and down he didn’t cheat but the proof is in my test results! I have been at home with our toddler the last year and definitely haven’t stepped out. I took vows! Unsure of how to proceed. He has no family in this country that he can stay with (not that I really give a fuck) but I do not want him in my house anymore. He doesn’t take me serious when I tell him he has to go. I really don’t want to get police involved but I need him out. It doesn’t seem real but I under no circumstances can forgive him or try to work it out. I would never be able to trust him again. I don’t know what to do... this is so sad. He promised he would never do this. Here I am 27, about to be a divorced single mother.."
"Should I ask him why he ghosted? So I \[F 21\], have been talking to this guy \[ M 22 \] for a couple of months now, things were going well besides a few bumps in the road, until recently.

Due quarantine our main form of communication is by text. At the start he was a great texter, constantly replied, started conversations and put effort in. Things were going so well the beginning that he gave me a hoodie of his. As well introduced me to his family through skype.

Since then he's been giving me mixed signals about committing to our relationship. In the past week, he's been short with his texts and leaving me on reading for days at a time.

A couple of days ago, I told him id return his jacket back and didn't question why I wanted to give it back or seemed bothered by it.

I feel like asking him why he has been acting differently.

Is it worth it? Will I just be giving him power?

By power I mean will I make think he meant more to me than I meant to him.

"I'm obsessed with foreskin, am I exaggerating? Hi there,  
I'm a woman living in Israel and in here about 95% of men are circumcised and I'm thinking about it constantly, I'm actually OBSESSED with foreskin.  
I've researched everything about the functions of the foreskin and I discovered how important it is and how sensitive it is.  
I've been sleeping with men that looked like they bearly feel something and it ruins everything.  
But some were really enjoying themselves, so it's a problem because when I'm starting dating someone I don't know how much he will enjoy sex so I need to get in bed with him real quick.  
My fetish is teasing and seeing someone go crazy from pleasure and seeing his face expressions but it just doesn't work with some of them, and I need to stop dating them because of that which is so sad.  
The real problem is that I don't know what they feel so I don't know if i'm exaggerating (keep in mind that there are types of circumcision so there can be big differences in sensetivity)."
"Feeling Betrayed Kind of a long story but I would really appreciate some opinions and advice. 

I was molested by my biological father when I was 4, he was a raging alcoholic, beat my mother regular and terrorized my brother. Holes in walls, flipped tables, the whole nine. Shortly after my mother found out what happened to me, she appropriately divorced him.

His abuse had long lasting impacts. My brother has severe PTSD alongside with autism (PTSD exacerbates his autism and he’s on medication and in therapy). My mother suffered a brain bleed from being battered that triggered a stroke when I was 5 that rendered her disabled. I have suffered from depression for most of my life and tried to take my own life several times (I’m 24 now and hardly ever think about what happened as I am happy and healthy, but hold on). 

When I was 16 my mother got very sick (she also has a chronic illness) and needed help. Somehow she got in contact with him and we lived with him for a miserable year where he “helped” us, but instead I mostly babysat his younger children (my half siblings he picked over us) and he told me several times to my face that I made up the abuse. 

That obviously didn’t last long and he vanished when I turned 17, thankfully. Now with COVID-19 being a thing he apparently is talking to my mother wondering how we all are and he is apparently very worried about me since I have asthma and am at high risk. My mother told me she had been speaking to him for the past 8 months and she was surprised when I got extremely, extremely angry. 

Her defense is “I’m not in a relationship with him. He initiated it. We only text twice a month. He’s not an alcoholic anymore.” And I don’t entirely believe that. She also let slip that she is letting my brother SPEAK TO HIM ON THE PHONE because my brother needs to get over his anger that our father created. 

 Now, I’m pretty sure I’m 100% right. She’s being fucking disgusting. She is defending speaking to a man who abused her children verbally, sexually, and physically and beat her almost to death. She just wants to pretend like she didn’t tell me she’s talking to him and thinks I’m being over dramatic. 

To me, once an abuser: always an abuser. He has no right to know how we are. 

I would love to hear some thoughts on this. I’m furious at her. Either how do I stop being so angry or what else do I do here 

Thanks in advance"
"Was I raped by my boyfriend? This happened a few years ago when I was 16, but I feel like it affects me since I sometimes cry during sex for no reason (might be something else lol). I'm 21 now.

So I was in a long term relationship with my then boyfriend, but we were still in the first months. I was at school that day when something happened to my SD card and I couldn't see anything on it. I called my dad and he said he'll fix it when I get home, but a classmate told me that you have to open it up on a computer and every file ever on it would be visible. I freaked out remembering all the photos I had sent my then boyfriend, thinking my dad would see them. My boyfriend lived about 15 minutes from school so he told me to go over there and give him the card, and after school he would give it back fixed. I left during class and I was really stressed out, I didn't want to miss my next class and I also wanted to have time for lunch.

So I go over, still anxious about it and give him the card and then turn to leave. He said that he was alone however and wanted me to stay. I said I didn't want to miss my class. I don't remember how but he got me on his bed and he was on top of me, undressing me. All while I was crying and begging him to stop. He kept going while I was crying and saying 'no' and 'stop' the whole time. I remember the whole time he didn't say one thing, he was just staring at me. Eventually he was finished and I just left.

I never saw it as rape then, considering we were in a relationship and we did last a long time after that, but ever since then I (most of the time) cry during sex, or when I don't want to have sex I feel really bad about saying it. I still feel bad for calling it rape considering rape victims go through a lot, they might not now their rapist and it most likely is a lot more traumatizing than this.

Thank you in advance."
"unwanted extra attention from ex mistress My[22f] boyfriend[28m] has been getting a lot of attention from my (childhood) friend and our old roommate. To spare a long and stressful half year of absolute bullshit, I'll sum it up with when we had relationship troubles and were on/off they were fooling around

Fast forward to now when we are no longer living together and friend/exroommate[21f] and I have decided to take a break from our friendship. Personally, after what happened, idk if I want to reconnect because she lied to me the most, and has yet to take responsibility for it/plays victim(""I was hurt too/how could you do this to me/how dare you question my love for you how could you even think you're not important to me(....rly?)"". Apparently that doesnt extend to boyfriend, and she regularly hearts/cares his posts and comments on everything (I wouldnt care if she did the same for me but she has since ignored my existence entirely). I told him how it makes me feel so he told her to back off/we're trying to work through every thing and that just sets us back to half a year ago (he says he did, I have no way of knowing if he really did or not. I'd like to believe him, and it would make sense cos the time period in question would line up with her sudden couple posts about ""fuck this"" and shit, which were all promptly deleted.) But still she insists, it stopped for a hot second but came back in another wave. Today is bf's birthday and I was doing better about letting go/moving forward/focusing on him and not her/reading into her posts and shit, then she posts on his wall an honestly incredibly sweet message topped with ""happy birthday sweetheart""

idk just a bunch of shit. bf has a hard time being ~public~ on fb and can barely even write I love you to me on public, and this morning he admitted it's because despite everything he still worries about pissing her off/starting drama. I told him firstly would he rather piss her off or lose our relationship again, but also that if she tries to start drama over that kind of shit then it's not something we need to exhaust ourselves dealing with and a proper no contact would come about. He agreed and said it made him feel better, wrote me a nice comment that I didnt ask for. then ten minutes later he comments on hers and says 'love ya too' no problem. granted he didnt acknowledge the sweetheart part, but that's kind of just.. idk, that doesnt make me feel any better.

anyways, my question is how do I tell him I cant be in this relationship if this continues? hes been understanding, truly, but he hasn't taken a lot of action. I crave intimacy, and being public is part of that for me. I dont want to be hidden. I dont think he's having an affair, as she moved back to her state and we're stuck indoors for fucks knows how long. Am I being unreasonable? I know I'm a little wonky, i think i need more time to heal on my own. I keep expecting the worst and i feel like eventually I'll manifest it. 

I do want to say that other than this things are pretty great and carefree. our relationship has never felt so easy, but still its the hardest it's ever been. also we both have mental health issues. I do love him and I believe he loves me, just.. maybe it can be toxic, and for that I know we need to take a real break

I dont know how to tl;dr this uh,, 
tl;dr bf's ex mistress favors him heavily and ignores my existence and I feel the line has been crossed when she called him sweetheart on his timeline and he just kinda.. took it. how can I express myself to him properly?"
"Question about a guy’s (22/M) texting pattern in a conversation with me (20/F) I (20/F) have been talking to this guy (22/M) from uni for about a month now and we became mates. Since then we have texted each other pretty regularly.

The component that baffles me though is his usage of “lol”. I noticed that he uses it a lot, especially at the start or end of his sentences. It is most prevalent when he is vulnerable (like complementing me), but does just it throughout general conversation. Does that take away from the complement and why does he use that word so much? Is that just his style of texting or is he trying to keep the conversation light-hearted?

tl;dr Why does one use “lol” so much in text, even if what they said wasn’t funny?"
"The Stages of love What’s is love tho. To me, it means having special feelings for something. That thing can be a person, place, or thing. As an example I love my self mindset, my car, and my mcm bag. But those things make up one big aspect of my life. They bring me joy. They put a smile on my face in the morning. But deeper then material objects you can find love in people. People who care and love back. My friends, I care so deeply for my friends. My family who is the oxygen to my earth. And my girlfriend who is the coffee in the morning that keeps me going. Yes I know this all sounds very cheesy. But think below the surface. Love makes up everything around us. It binds us together. And With love comes the ups and downs. The pain and suffering. And the everlasting end. Now the end can mean 2 things. Divorce or staying together until time does us part. 
The thing with divorce is no matter how much you want to hate your ex. They can’t escape your head. You seen them everywhere and everything reminds you of them. Then when you decide to talk to each other. It ends with tears and yelling. The pain hits the heart different. You can try to see other people to fill the void of that person, but deep down you know it reminds that you can’t find someone who gave you as many memories as that person. You want to tell your loved one that your sorry and just hug them but you don’t know what the outcome will be. So you let them walk away as the door slams.  And you break down in your bed that you guys used to sleep in. Life is different but you want it to go back. You regret when you don’t want to. 
So to answer my question. What is love? Love is what you make of it. Don’t question it. Don’t deny it. Just accept it. And prosper what you got."
"Should I get back with my ex? I'll admit, I'm young (15), so this relationship will most likely mean nothing to me in 4 years because let's, be real, 99% of high school relationships don't work out. But maybe this will be the 1%. 

Okay, so, a while back my now ex, then girlfriend (we'll call her Jess) were having a bit of difficulty because her friends hated me and I didn't get along with a couple of them too well (previous altercations led to this). Anyways, Jess decided that with the drama with her friends, and drama at home, was ultimately too much to be dealing with and having a relationship at the same time, so she cut things off, saying that she just couldn't handle a relationship at the time. 

Fast forward a few months, while my feelings of affection towards her have mostly been suppressed, I know they're still there. I've heard through the grape vine that she is going to ask me out after this whole quarantine thing is done and dusted, and I'm stumped.

On the one hand, she didn't pay much attention to me while we dated, but she did that with all her other past relationships but seems to have changed now (evident by her most recent relationship). But on the other, I do have a policy of not getting back with ex's, but the circumstances are a bit more complex than ""this didn't work out, it was fun while it lasted"".

So Reddit, any advice?"
"I'm not attracted to him... I have been with this guy for 4 years now. Our love story is very unique- but I will cut to the chase. He is the perfect guy- he would do anything for me, he takes care of me, he never walks away from a fight, and always wants to fix things, rarely gets frustrated-He is honestly an angel. The thing is I am not attracted to him. I have always just been attracted to who he was, and 4 years ago that was enough for me but he is definitely not my type and I am much more attractive than him (that sounds terrible when I type it, but it is true and people have told me so). Our sex is terrible, and I don't think it's anything he is doing, I am just not into because I don't find him sexy at all. I always feel sexually frustrated because I am a very sexual person but he doesn't scratch that itch for me. I am so torn because I don't want to ruin what we have created- he is truly my best friend but part of me thinks about what it would be like to be with someone who could satisfy my sexual needs. What would you do in my situation?"
"""Waiting"" for sex - what's your timeline I (40F) see that in modern dating there is a lot of hook up culture. If you met someone online or whatever and progressed to real life dates would you be willing to wait 3-4 months for example before sex?

Not for religious reasons but just because the person did not  want to get emotionally entangled through sex for a relationship that might only be short term.

Would you just cut your losses?"
"Have any of you gotten back together with an ex? How long were you broken up and what helped you to get them back? If 2 people love each other, do you think they’ll come back together? I’m 21 and broke up with my ex impulsively 6 weeks ago over text after a 2 year relationship. It was a very ugly breakup. But at the time of the breakup, at least, we both loved each other. He refused to come back the next day and said it’s for the best. I have reached out a few times (i have not said sorry for anything, i avoid the topic of our breakup because I can sense he is very distant) and he always replies a few days later in the middle of the night."
"I (27F) found out my married father (65M) is on dating websites. How do I approach this? So pretty much as the title says. My father was showing me something on his phone and somehow he accidentally got into his emails and I saw a plethora of dating site emails. He quickly shuffled to get back to what he wanted to show me. I probably should have said something then, but I didn’t. Instead, I know this is wrong, I waited until he was away from his phone and I looked at his emails. Every unread email was from dating sites and from the looks of it he is currently using 3. He is having conversations with multiple women. I don’t know the extent of the conversations because I didn’t actually click into the threads, I don’t think I can handle that. My parents have been married for 30+ years. I understand marriages are tricky , and some may have unconventional arrangements. But I know my mother is not about that life. And they seem to be in a good spot. I feel really awful for my mother, she carries our family on her back, so I don’t want to hurt her. I told my older brother about this and he is livid, but he also doesn’t know how to handle this. 

Also please note that this happened before years back when I was in high school and the family shared a desktop. I confronted him then, and he said he and my mother were having issues etc. I was young and I just left it alone because I felt like it wasn’t my business. But now I just feel like this is completely disrespectful to my mother and everything she does for our family. 

Any insight is appreciated. Not sure if I should confront him again, tell my mother, or keep my mouth closed (and let my conscience burn)."
"My mom is mad at me for saying I was “tired” Throwaway because I don’t want this on my personal account. 

So this morning I was in the kitchen helping my mom with something and we were just casually talking. She asked me why my sister hasn’t applied for the online job that I have applied for. She asked if it was hard. I just simply said it’s “tiresome” without thinking anything about it. That’s genuinely how I felt because the process was too long but it didn’t mean that I wasn’t working on it.

Now, my parents grew up very poor and had to work their asses off to live the way we live right now. We’re not rich but we’re also not as poor as they were. 

When I told her it was tiresome, she got mad and started yelling because “that’s nothing compared to what I went and am going through” and I also got mad and confused because I was in no way invalidating her tiresome experiences. So I told her that it wasn’t wrong and prohibited to feel tired and express it no matter the situation and that she shouldn’t compare our experiences. She just yelled more and told me that I had no right to say that because having an “online job” was far more easier than everything she’s gone through. I just told her again and again that I wasn’t saying that she wasn’t tired as well. 

I guess the advice that I want is how I could get her to understand. She’s old-fashioned and believes that the parents are always right. I also realized that this is why I don’t like talking to her about stuff because she gets this way and she would never listen to my side."
"I want to like my fiancé’s friend but I can’t get over one thing.. help? Okay so I’ll start by saying I (21F) have a lovely fiancé (22M) and we’re very in love and I do trust him completely. 

My fiancé is trans, so his friend group consists mostly of girls. We were friends for a while before dating so I knew this already and I get along well with (almost) all of his friends so no biggie. (I’ll add a side note that my ex was a cheater and a liar so it was an adjustment but again, I get along with most everyone and trust my fiancé).

Fiancé has one friend, let’s call her M, who was around before me. She helped him out and let him live with her when he got kicked out of his house, and has been one of his best friends. Before we started dating, I found out that fiancé and M have hooked up a couple times. Whatever, I tried not to really talk about it again.

Once we start dating, I tell fiancé I want to know everything that happened with M and to tell me the truth. He does, it was nothing serious, and M pretty much refused to acknowledge that it happened. Now here’s the problem I’m having:

I’ve hungout with fiancé and M together and it’s not that I don’t like M (she is typically the kind of friend I would have) but I just can’t get over the fact that they’ve hooked up more than once. Fiancé understands and said if the roles were reversed he would probably not be as understanding and he says he appreciates that I don’t try to make him end the friendship. I just think it would make everyone’s life easier if I could get over it and we could all be friends. Fiancé has told me that M thinks I hate her and wishes I liked her. (He’s told her that I do not hate her and he understands why I feel the way I do, and her friends have also said the same)

I feel bad, as I do not hate her I just feel very weird about the situation. I wish I could be her friend without thinking about it and that there would be no tension. Am I crazy for being hung up on this? Does anyone have any advice?

Edit: I guess I should clarify a little better. I don’t think my fiancé wants M. I don’t think they’re doing anything wrong. I just don’t want to hangout with her because of this, but now M thinks I hate her. I don’t hate her, I don’t stress out about the two of them together. I just don’t like hanging out with her because I just feel weird.  I just think it would be easier for everyone if I didn’t feel weird and liked hanging out with M."
"I hate her more than my brother who molested me as a toddler. Sister wanted nothing to do with me growing up, but now plays it off like we are buddy buddy. Curious about what reddit thinks I should do? If anything? Me(22) Her (31) Brother(32) Hello! I am new to reddit and was reading someone else's post concerning their sibling when I realized I could ask reddit for their hopefully unbiased thoughts.

I'm sorry if this ends up being a long story. There's a lot of life in this. I'll try to keep things short yet descriptive. I do have a history of trailing off sometimes tho. Thank you to anyone who actually reads this and has constructive criticism for me. I will definitely appreciate it and take it to heart. ***TL;DR at the bottom.***

*NSFW tag because of mild references to sexual assault of a minor and some light swearing here and there*

SO... background. 

When I was a toddler, my brother would molest me. That's about the extent that I'll say to spare the details. He is 10 yrs older than me, while my sister is 9 years older. At some point early on, I vaguely remember running out of my brother's room when my parents got home one night to.... excitedly tell them about how my brother would... ""fix me (aka play doctor)."" ........As far as I know, it stopped with me there. I say with me because I guess he went after a cousin? There's a lot of back story and drama when these things all came out. Long story short, he got some dui's, had some therapy, eventually got to a place where he called me up one night and basically said the classic apology thing. ""You don't have to forgive me but you deserve to hear this blah blah blah."" He validated my trauma, recognized that he could never be the brother I deserved(or something along those lines), and told me he wants to be better in the future so that we can have some sort of relationship, even if it's at a distance. 

I think I had forgiven him through my own therapy by then but after that it was kinda solidified and I have rooted for him ever since. (Not that he isn't still struggling &gt;-&gt;)  

Later on we actually discovered Autism is in the family genes due to my nephew's diagnosis. My brother is very similar to my nephew in many ways, so while my brother never took the test, I'm pretty sure about what the results might show if he did. I mention this because it explains a certain inability to empathize or understand the emotions of others. (For example, whenever I would cry, he would say I was faking it. This was very confusing growing up and has made me always unsure if my emotions were real or not. I realize now that he may just have truly believed I was faking my emotions because he was incapable of grasping that I had any on a certain level.)

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so now for my sister.

While my sister has never done anything as major as that in our life, she still fully rejected me as much as my brother did when we all lived together. Her and I shared a very small room with bunk beds right up until she moved into her (now) ex's home.  I have a very early memory of her being nice to me but after a certain point, she hated me and everything to do with me. **It's hard for me to know if I should put it aside because of the classic sibling trope, or if there was more there.** I also have no idea of how much she knew of the brother thing and what her part in that whole dynamic was. All I know is she treated me like crap. Ever since a very early age until about 16, I would literally cry myself to sleep most nights. I have eczema. She would yell at me for scratching at night, but would say and do nothing for all the times I cried. (I tried to cry silently but how silent can a kid be?) 

Thinking back now, I can imagine my parents must have made her drag me along a lot because they probably didnt trust my brother to watch me as much anymore. Also suddenly having to share a room with another small child had to suck butts so I'm sure she must have resented my entire existence. 

As soon as she moved out of the house (in a very unfortunate way) she suddenly wanted to be super nice and friendly to me all the time. It was like all those years of hating me and neglecting me were gone. I start to well up a bit just thinking about it and how angry it makes me feel now. 

Throughout the years, she had two kids with a guy who is older than my mother. My mother is currently 54 if that puts things in perspective. He has had multiple wives in the past who all have full custody of the 20 some kids he has had in his life. The guy was/is super messed up and my sister divorced  from him about a year or two ago. Divorced why? He was emotionally abusive/manipulative. He still tries to manipulate her to this day. With how terrible he was, he still has the majority of the time with the kids. My sister only sees them on weekends and wednesday evenings.  Why??? Because she works a factory job. 

Everyone suspects this is a cover tho because she often comes across as uncaring of what the kids do/get into, and justs stays on her phone most of the time. I also particularly dislike that when interacting with the kids, she is constantly yelling at my nephew, while doting on his sister who is a year younger than him. She does dote on him too, but she is very hot and cold towards him. **Part of me feels a pull of responsibility as their aunt to be involved in their lives, however my dislike for my sister and equal dislike for kids in general has made it so that I avoid the kids whenever I can.** Also something that is very confusing to me is that she has conditioned her daughter to think I am one of the best things in the whole ass world. Whenever I'm around, my sister plays up that I am the best aunt in the world.  

Like, fuck no I'm not! I want nothing to do with your kids!

Things have kind of just continued to spiral in general for my siblings. 

They both eventually ended up living together in our old home (parents own it and siblings pay a cheap rent) while my parents and I moved away, luckily within 10 mins of my college campus. (So I'm still stuck living with my parents...yay). They constantly get into more and more fights because of their shared poor behavior. My sister mostly tho, because she doesnt clean up after herself or the kids, and is constantly taking things from my brother and even going so far as to steal money from him. He actually had to quit college in order to support her once she moved in. My brother on the other hand does not handle this well and has even gotten so angry that he started to choke my sister once. (Its crazy) She is regularly smoking her money away on weed and is in another new toxic relationship with an on and off again deadbeat boyfriend who really is just mooching off her.  

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this relevant?  My parents. 

They are very much supporting/enabling my siblings by letting them live in/destroy the house my dad wants to sell. My sister's cat (which she doesnt take care of... dont get me started on this poor cat) pees on everything and the house is always an udder mess. 

Something else.... I realize this can't be helped so much, but I found out from my mother that the money my parents saved up for me to go to college all got drained out in my sister's divorce. The ex also hates my dad so he is always finding some reason to take my parents to court just to drain the bank. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously this leaves me feeling very resentful of the burden my sister puts on mine and my parents lives, while she has little to no drive to better her situation. Obviously motivation is tough when you get to live with cheap rent from your parents. Both siblings want the other to move out. Both probably have some form of depression and other emotional issues that REAAAAAAAALLY should be worked out in therapy. Unfortunately with my sister, she is more like my dad who thinks a it's ""none of their business"" when it comes to a therapist. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's about it for all the context.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some other things about myself I guess I should mention is I was seeing a counselor before. I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation, which is easily managed with counseling/having an operable support network that with I can talk my problems through. (rip grammar it's 4am here). Also I realize I say ""easily managed"" but it took a lot of pain and years of self-hate/bottling up my problems to get to that realization. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately my main counselor left the practice about 6 months ago due to some health issues and the newer counselor just did not work for me. I stopped seeing her with the excuse of covid. So right now I am not attending therapy. I'm basically fine I guess for now. I have a clear career path, much better self-respect, my romantic relationship is good (we had a lot of rough patches that got worked out in therapy), I have a good enough retail job in the meantime, my relationship with my parents is.... ok.... (also worked out a bit in therapy). 

So I really don't have much need for any sort of operational relationship with my siblings and the kids, outside of obligatory family gatherings. 

&amp;#x200B;

The resentment towards my sister stills stands tho. I have always been one to hold a grudge because I believe resentment is justified if you were truly wronged and nothing was ever truly acknowledged. Forgive, but never forget type of thing, but with a little less forgive in there....  The resentment has never been something I enjoyed thinking about in terms of trying to possibly confront or rectify. I can only ever think that my only option would be to call my sister out which would likely split the family up even more so than it is. ***I have always played nice/ complacent so as not to rock any boats in this particular situation, because I don't really know if I have a right to rock the boat in the first place.*** 

So reddit please... In your infinite wisdom... What is your opinion? What should I do? 

Should I attempt to face this problem head on by having a \***gasp**\* actual conversation with my sister where I reveal all my hatred and resentment? 

or

Should I continue on as I always have? Dont rock the family boat too much. Go about my own life, possibly leading to just straight up cutting my siblings out of my life in every way except at face value. Likely trying to work through it with a new therapist some day........ (&gt;-&gt; which is a chore trying to get a new therapist, let me tell you.) 

&amp;#x200B;

Or do you have another approach in mind? Something that I may not have considered yet. Something that will address the resentment but in a more subtle way or in a way that wont really ""rock the boat"" so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll try to reply soon if anyone actually reads this long post. I **doubt** it will go viral but if it does:

TL;DR Brother who molested me as a toddler/terrorized me growing up (who likely has some spectrum of autism), has reached out to make amends with me in past years, and I have forgiven him due to him validating the trauma he put me through. 

Sister refuses to get herself help and has never acknowledged what she did/ did not do growing up, yet now plays me up as the amazing aunt to her daughter and uses every opportunity to act like we are bff sisters. I resent her for her lack of acknowledgement in comparison to my brother. 

Should I try to make amends? Or should I go with my lazy gut and just try not to have anything to do with her?"
"My (17M) girlfriend (17F) of a year and a half randomly asked me about my body preference and got mad at me when I was “dishonest”? Obligatory throwaway and mobile formatting thing yadda yadda

I’m sorry in advance if this is long or ramble-y, not exactly in the best state of mind.

Everything escalated pretty quickly so I might leave out some details but I’ll try my best to be accurate. My girlfriend got upset at me a couple of hours ago over something I really can’t wrap my head around. She first asked me if I preferred whether if she shaved her pubes or not (which I might add was very off topic). I said I preferred shaved but it wasn’t really a big deal to me so I didn’t care if she did or not. She somehow segued into my preferences coming from porn. Keep in mind I haven’t watched porn in months other than a few occasions because she got mad at me for it, but it wasn’t that big of a part of my life and I love her so I was fine with stopping. 

She then out of the blue said “i wish i looked like those girls you like, I know theres a part of you that wishes i look better” and “you only like me because you can have sex with me”.
I followed that was trying to reassure her that I very much like they way she looks now and that I think she’s the perfect body type for me. She tried asking me what I would change about her body or what my ideal body for my gf would be and I would always respond that I think she’s perfect for me but she wanted “an honest answer” and was “getting worried that I’m not telling the truth.” This was really confusing to me because for the past 3 days or so I’ve tried initiating and she’s said no every time, which I was fine with. She started getting really upset that I “was t being honest” with her. She said I was simping and being a white knight? I told her maybe she should go to bed since she has to get up for work in 5 hours and we could talk about it later but she accused me of “not caring”. For a while it was just me and her going back and forth with whether I was being honest or not. 

Then she goes on about how it “isn’t that hard to give an honest answer” and that I’m “literally making it into a fight”. I was getting annoyed at this point so I just said “idk ig you could have bigger boobs?” (which is bs). She said that my “half assed answers” just prove that I “don’t fucking care at all”. She also said I only love her because of our sex and that she was done talking to me. I said something about how all of this stuff is jist her insecurities in her head and she lost it. Saying I was gaslighting her and being manipulative. (We has a fight a couple weeks ago where the day after she admitted to trying to manipulate me so she used the excuse “at least I admit to doing it” and my friend also said she was gaslighting when I showed him dms). 

She then blew up and said that she wanted a break and didn’t want to talk to me because she was “sick of my gaslighting” and “commanding her to go to bed”(?). I instantly recognized this has the same behavior that she admitted to being manipulative and just unadded her (this was on discord) so she couldn’t message me. She immediately texted me and said “k that was the last straw im breaking up with you, i hate you honestly and i cant believe you are like this, goodbye (my name).” She went to bed after that I assume and I haven’t heard from her since. 

All of this is just really hard because I still love her so much and she’s been a huge part of my life for a while now. We’re in a pretty bad rough patch but this past week was really good so I’m just really caught off guard by this. She has mental heath issues and I think this has something to do with it and I don’t want to let that ruin our relationship

Thank you to anyone who read this. I’m sorry for how long it ended up being I’m not very good at condensing my thoughts. Any advice on how to move forward is greatly appreciated. Again thank you"
"Corona virus hoax believer One of my close friends has been taking it to Facebook and every day she post about 3 stories and posts  corona being a ploy for the government to take our freedom and constitutional  rights, how we are sheep for believing without questioning, how we need to see both sides and the objective truth. Videos from pastor Danny Jones where he states this is the new world order among other dumb stuff. 


I really want to respond to her but I don't know if I should, I don't want to be mean either I just want to put this.
""It is really irresponsible to promote fear mongering, right know the only definite thing we know is that the virus is spreading and the only thing we can do to prevent it is to stay at home. There are so many doctors and nurses spreading this message and you decide to believe a pastor and a disgraced doctor that lost his license for malpractice. As an American I value my freedom and I appreciate that right know it gives me the option to stay at home and focus on the well being of everyone."
"My husband is refusing to give me the name of a marriage counselor he supposedly made an appointment with (mutually agreed upon), what the blank do I do? My husband [32m] and I [35f] have been having a lot of marriage issues....  we have been married for almost 4 years, got engaged after a month of dating but didn’t we’d for 1.5yrs... we had a major fight last week (one of many) and we both agreed to finally go see a marriage counselor. I’ve been begging to go for nearly a year, he’s had many excuses to not go. I just got home from a short hospital stay due to a stress induced hemiplegic migraine or TIA (think small stroke, docs couldn’t agree on final diagnosis) he said he made an appointment but refuses to tell me who it’s with, where, the name of the practice, anything but the time. He has a history of lying and I suspect he’s a narcissist. The local behavioral center near us is a good one, we agreed we would start there and see one of their marriage counselors. It being a pandemic and we were in a stay at home order (florida, it’s not expired) I accepted the fact that getting an appointment would be difficult. I have no issues with a telemedicine appointment but he refused... he said that unless we went in person he would not participate. He believes that telemedicine appointments are lacking and that the therapist needs to see us in person to get the “full picture” of us and to get a good read on us. I am desperate for us to go see someone so I bent my position and agreed to go in person vs. telemedicine. I was asking him about doctors appointments he rescheduled for me while I was in the hospital (I have several severe chronic illnesses that need specialists) but he won’t tell me any details about this “marriage counselor”. He said that the behavioral center told him that they don’t do marriage counseling and that they gave him the name of a marriage counselor near us to call. What do I do, I am so fed up... we are fighting again and I flat out told him that yes one of the reasons I want the name is because I suspect he didn’t make an appointment and the date and time he gave us was made up. I admit I have trust issues that I need to work on from a previous marriage, but is it unreasonable to want to know the name of the doctor/counselor that we are supposed to go see together? What do I do? He’s now walked out of the bedroom to go sleep on the living room couch knowing that I find that incredibly hurtful bc my ex husband did that to me. Should I apologize and let it go? I feel like now he’s going to say that he cancelled the appointment... he’s told me to get a lawyer bc I went to social media for advice and that I am defaming his character. Believe me if I had any friends to talk to about this I wouldn’t have gone public, if this hadn’t been the first time he’s done something similar or lied or stretched the truth I wouldn’t have had to resort to this.... help."
"My [30] gf [33] never initiates sexual contact and its getting to me In the past I've always been the one to initiate sexual contract, and this has been an issue we have discussed. My gf said its because she is submissive, though I don't see how that should mean she is never the one to start things.

Today, I woke up and started making a move on her, as we lay in bed (it's been about 6 days since we last had sex and we're in lockdown). She was scrolling on her phone and told me to give her five minutes. So I said OK, and lay back down, falling half asleep. Way more than five minutes passes, and I felt pissed off because if I had told her to give me five minutes (which I would never do... Especially just scrolling on my phone) then I would expect to have to be the one who starts making advances once five minutes is up.

An hour later I open my eyes, and she's reading a book. I slide over and push the book away (in what I thought was a playful manner, she doesn't agree). She gets pissed at that. So I go lay with my back to her, she then realises I'm annoyed so she comes over and pokes and prods me in a comedic way (sexy, huh) and then can't believe it when I tell her maybe we should try another time..  As obviously it's now not the mood for sex.

I'm pissed about this whole thing now. I'm mainly pissed about her telling me to wait five minutes, and then her not doing anything to initiate once that time was up. I'm sick of feeling like I'm the one making all the moves. I wouldn't mind giving her five minutes, but I'm not happy about giving her five minutes and waiting for an hour with her not coming to me. 

Am I wrong to feel aggrieved?"
"So I should start this by saying I’m not in a relationship. I welcome the help and hatred that follows. Hello to all who come to read the words I have come to tell. So, it’s been about 5 days since I’ve destroyed a relationship with someone. It was already on rocky feet, because I never dealt with certain trauma and inner pain and sadness and I brought it to the table too much. Not even close to always but certainly too often. I let my insecurities allow me to become clouded, because I “expected” my partner was cheating on me. Not because I’m dull or don’t know what I’m doing, when I’m on in life I’m fire incarnated. My energy is loved by many people. But when I’m off and low, I’m lower than the oceans. And that has never truly manifested itself in a physical form before recently. I started trying to hold her back when she was trying to leave the fights. And that only got worse for a time. Truly I know I am not capable of doing anything to intentionally bring harm to another human. It’s not who I am. I gain no joy in the pain of others, only in their growth. But my actions have hurt people and while I know I will never doing anything like it again I also know I never thought I’d do it in the first place. I put my hands on her neck. I tried to hold her from leaving the room. In a twisted way I was trying to fulfill a bedroom dynamic I thought we both had wanted. I let that dynamic consume a part of my life. A dynamic I have never been a part of before. I remember being 8 years old going to a therapist and overhearing how such a high percentage of people who see what I’ve seen and been through what I have turn into things that I never want to be. I remember that fear and I’ve carried it with me in the back of my mind for what feels like my whole life. With everything happening in the world it’s like all my insecurities and fears have magnified. We were always amazing together, I mean in 29 years of life I’ve never felt as connected to anyone period. All the things we were before all this anxiety and fear became overwhelming we’re what many people would call perfect. People would die for what we had. And I almost let myself die for fear of losing it. I’ve had 16 hours of sleep in 5 days 9 of which came last night. I’m going to sleep again, and when I awake I will read the advice of all who care to share and those who are filled with hatred know that nobody will ever be more sorrowful for what I have done, and the behaviors will never be repeated."
"How do I get across that I am frustrated at my [17M] parents for how they're treating my depression / suicidal thoughts? For the past several years I believe I have been dealing with a high-functioning depression. This has culminated in suicidal thoughts that haven't yet gone away. Some months ago, I broke down in front of one of my teachers and I was taken to the counselor. I took a test and I was considered ""high risk"" for chance of suicide. 

My mom came to pick me up, my stepdad came home from work. We talked it out and I was asked what I wanted to do. I responded ""I don't know."". I genuinely didn't know what to do. Whenever I've been faced with a choice for the past years I've responded ""I don't know"". Whether it's what I want for dinner, what I want to do for an activity or something, etc. I genuinely do not know what I want nor do I particularly care. I cannot get excited over anyting. My parents know this.

Like I said, I told them months ago, nothing has changed between us. If I call my mom on accident and tell her to disregard the call she'll call me back anyway, but that's about it. They told me to tell them if I'm having suicidal thoughts. To be fair, I haven't been quite good on that as it's difficult for me to open up. I've been feeling like I don't matter for some time now. I don't really know what to.

Right after righting that last paragraph my step-dad confronted me about my sulking attitude while writing this. I started venting about this stuff and I guess I no longer need to post this, but I just need to vent some more. I told him how I feel like I don't matter and am not loved, I pointed out a lot of family issues (possible neglect, abuse from siblings and always being put down). I know it sounds whiny but I am actually frustrated at this stuff. He gave me a whole lot of ""you need to improve"", ""you can't change others"" that ""I need to look at things differently"". 

What hurt the most was when he said I was laying it out on everyone, I struggle with feeling like a burden so this really hurt. I pointed this out and he denied that at first he said it, then that he meant it that way. It wasn't all bad, he said I was loved, acknowledged that he had no idea what I was feeling and the like. He promised me my brother hitting me would be stopped. He also said we could do therapy.. I'm not mad at him, only frustrated. It feels like he wants me to figure out stuff on my own without any kind of change from the rest of them.

I feel like I'm being an ass for being difficult.

TL:DR, I'm depressed and suicidal, nothing had really changed once I told my parents.  My parents seem to think I can just snap out of it. How do I get across to them?"
"I (M27) don't want to have alcohol at my wedding. My fiance (F29),however, does. What should we do? I don't drink alcohol. My fiance does. I really don't want there to be alcohol at our wedding but she does. We've been arguing about this for about a week now and we still don't know what to do. What should we do?"
"Should I (29m), after 3 months break no contact and reach out to my ex(25f) Should I break no contact and reach out to my ex. It's been almost 3 months to the day that my ex and I parted ways. It wasn't a rough break up, she thought that I wasn't communicating with her towards the end of it as, I was working through some personal issues that I was experiencing. Overall the relationship I thought was really good and I thought we were on the fast track to something really special. It was just when I started going through some personal issues that really put a dark spot on our relationship and things fell apart rather quickly. So my question is should I break no contact after three months and reach out to my ex? Should I reach out to her roommate/best friend and ask how so-and-so is doing?"
"When talking to someone you recently met how often do you reply back to their messages? Like say you met someone on a dating app (like a month or less) and you finally moved from just talking on the app to texting/snapchat messages 

I’m trying to figure out how long is too long to where I should maybe ask him if something is going on or what’s wrong."
What’s wrong with me? Hello. I’m a (20F) that is having trouble with my current relationship. So a while ago I met this guy who was everything I could’ve ever dreamed of but we kinda rushed into a relationship and I think rushing things ruined it for me or idk what it is. We agreed to take things slow and start over again by being friends but I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and the thought of doing something intimate with him again makes me uncomfortable. My past relationships haven’t been with the best people but it’s been a really long time since I’ve been in a relationship and I’ve had some time to think about what it is that I want in a relationship and I don’t think this is it. I really enjoy him as a friend but nothing more than that. It makes me feel really bad because he is an incredibly good person and fun to be around but I’m just not feeling it anymore. Is there something wrong with me??
"Is gaining weight ruining my relationship? Me (23f) and my partner (23m) have lived together for about a year now. When I met him we were both a few stone slimmer but I'm worried weight might be ruining our relationship.

Just want to say that I'm just as attracted to him as I was when I first met him (he was around 14 stone/ 196 lbs). And I was around 12 stone/168 lbs). Over the past few months we have both gotten bigger (I'm now 14 stone/ 196 lbs) and he's 17 stone (238 lbs). We both don't like the fact that we've put on weight and were both self conscious. 

Quarentine has definitely highlighted some problems, we barely have sex anymore bc were both just not in the mood I guess? But I'm finding that whenever I ask him to do like a normal task eg. doing washing, cleaning up after his own mess I'm either met with him going in a mood, getting defencive and proving me wrong somehow ""well I don't actually need to do it etc etc"" or he will just put it off for a few days. He'll wait until hes super hungry, I'll try to talk him out of overeating (eg.15 inch pizzas plus a whole tub of Ben and Jerry's for dessert and well as snacking and eating other meals throughout the day) but I'm just met with ""well I'm fucking starving"" and he'll just order a takeaway rather than food prepping something in advance. I've said time and time again that we need to do it, but I've just started cooking my own meals now. I dunno if it's worth mentioning that he's vegan so food mainly consists of bread in some way.

I thought that having time off of work would have been nice for him to relax (he gets real stressed at work, he's a tattoo artist) but he's just done nothing for pretty much too months. I've tried to push him to help me do little things, like decorate the literally two walls of the hallway, hoover, clear out a cupboards, bake, learn to cook new meals but I'm just met with ""i cba"" every. single. day. And it's really bumming me out.

He is a sweet person but the only thing we disagree on seems to be these issues. I love him but I don't want to babysit someone for a relationship. Has gaining weight made him more lazy, or is it something else? 

If there is anything wrong I'd love to support him, he isn't the type to say what's up so I always have to ask."
"He’s trying to cheat on the broad he left me for, with me. Backstory: my baby daddy cheated on me so I left him. He’s now cheating on the broad he left me for, with me - - although I won’t let him because I can’t go through that again. 

What is happening? Why is this happening?

Please don’t say something like I have a lack of respect for me. I haven’t gone through with anything. I’m just trying to understand his thinking without having to actually engage with him if I don’t have to. 

Thanks for any advice or info!"
"My [16F] dad [48] is becoming increasingly racist towards my bf [17M] I’m super close with my dad and always have been. I’ve always know that he is conservative in his views and you could say that I am to an extent. I go to an all girls school and my dad has always been the “come close to my daughter and I’ll get my gun” kinda guy.

Recently I started going on dates with my now bf after meeting him at a church event, he’s really nice with me and fine with going slow. I told my parents and asked permission to go out with him etc and my dad would just say “I don’t want to know!!” And let my mom make sure everything is safe (like driving me to meet him and stuff). He’s finally started coming around to the idea 2 months in to our dating and he was FURIOUS to find out my bf is black when I showed him a picture. I knew he was conservative but I had no idea he was a racist. He started ranting about how we kept it from him because we were ashamed and that he’s probably going to go to prison anyway... a bunch of just vile stupid comments when really I didn’t even know that his ethnicity was something I should have told him about.

We’re in lockdown together and he hasn’t spoken to me in three days, he keeps bringing up the ‘problem with blacks’ during dinner etc though and it’s just come out of nowhere and I feel like I don’t have my dad anymore. I didn’t know my loving and protective daddy could say such vile things never mind think them in the first place.

My mom told me it would probably be easier to break up with my bf and apologize to my dad but I don’t want to it all seems wrong.

How do I manage this situation and could it just be my dad getting used to me being with someone instead of just suddenly being a monster?

TLDR: my dad found out my bf is black and hasn’t talked to me in days"
"My boyfriend (25M) of three years used to talk about his ex partners in explicit and intimate detail, and I need advice on how to move past it. I'd like to start by apologizing for the length of this post, a lot of it is background info and I guess I'm also finally venting three years worth of experiences that I have otherwise kept inside. If you make it to the end, thank you so much for reading and thank you in advance for any advice you can offer.

I have been with my boyfriend for over three years now, on the whole we have a wonderful relationship and I can see us being together for the rest of our lives. He is the person I want to build my future with, I absolutely adore him and I would do anything for him. He is kind, considerate and everything I could ever want in a partner. However, today I wanted to get some advice on an issue that I have not been able to overcome, no matter how hard I try. 

At the very start of our relationship, my boyfriend had some serious issues with over-sharing; he talked about his previous relationships constantly. I know his ex girlfriends names, what they look like, how they dress, what music they listen to, what they studied at university, where they live, what they do for work, any health issues they have and more, ALL from what my boyfriend has told me. He also talked about them in deep, intimate detail and I know things about his previous partners that I feel I just should not know. He would talk about his sex life with his ex's very explicitly, he would tell me about what they liked in bed, what they didn't like, and any sexual issues they may have had as a couple. He told me all about dates they went on and would talk about the sweet memories he made with these ex girlfriends. I know all about how they got together and how they broke up. I never once asked for any of this information, yet I know far too much about the girls I have never met.

There was one ex in particular that bothered me more than all of the others, because he would talk a lot about how he genuinely believed he was going to spend the rest of his life with her, and I always felt as though he still had feelings for her. This was the girl he was with before me. The first time I spent the night at his place, he brought out a tied up plastic bag and opened it up, showing me a jumper (sweater) that was inside. He told me, ""I was keeping this because \[ex girlfriend\] used to wear it all the time and it still smells like her. I haven't been able to open it until now."" Implying that he was finally able to move on from her now that he had met me. As I type this out, I realize what a bizarre thing it actually was, and how it should have been a red flag right from the beginning. 

I actually met one of my boyfriends ex's a few months into our relationship. We were in his hometown visiting his family and it was the night before my 21st birthday. The trip had been lovely, and we were set to drive home that evening. Unfortunately it didn't work out that way, because my mother tried to make contact with me for the first time since I was 15, which resulted in me having a complete emotional meltdown. By the time I had calmed down it was very late and we didn't feel it was a good idea to make the three hour drive back. Because we weren't driving home that night, my boyfriend decided to pick up. He called his dealer, and said he was going out to meet her and that he didn't want to leave me alone after what had just happened with my mother. I told him I was fine to be alone, but he insisted I went to meet his dealer with him. So, we went out to pick up. I was still in shock and very upset about what had happened with my mother, but by this point my boyfriend was preoccupied with getting to the shop to buy his dealer the drink and snacks she had asked him for. We went to meet her and stayed while they smoked for a while, then we left. As we were driving back to my boyfriends fathers house, he told me that his dealer used to be his girlfriend. About a month later he showed me a topless photo of her that she had posted to her Instagram, and he asked me if I liked her new hair colour. I don't know why he ever felt like this was an appropriate thing to do, and I'm so angry at myself for not calling him out on it at the time. But I guess he just had no boundaries and felt comfortable to share anything with me.

I think it's important to say now that as much as he talked about other girls, he has always been incredibly sweet and loving towards me. He genuinely isn't a spiteful person and I don't believe he would ever intentionally hurt me, so I told myself I was just overreacting by letting it bother me so much. I believed that he trusted me enough to talk about these things, and I didn't want to upset him or embarrass him by telling him to stop. My boyfriend isn't somebody who is very open with his emotions, so I thought if I could let him vent it would help him, but I didn't realize how detrimental it would be for my own mental health. So I let him carry on, and it just got worse and worse.

It got to almost a year of us being together before I told him how I felt, because I finally realized how much of a negative impact the whole thing was having on me as a person. I found myself becoming completely obsessive over these girls and my self-confidence had plummeted. Before this I have never been insecure in a relationship, I've always been confident, laid-back and very secure in myself. But this really took it's toll on me and I could see myself becoming the kind of person I never wanted to be. I knew all of these girls names because he talked about them so often, so I looked them up on Facebook out of curiosity. They were all absolutely beautiful, and I noticed that they all looked very different to me - they all had tattoos, black hair, lots of piercings and an alternative style, so I started to wonder if this was his ""type"" and I began to doubt why he had ever chosen to be with me in the first place. By this point he would talk about his ex's relentlessly, even while we were in bed together, even after we'd had sex. I'm not exaggerating when I say that we could hardly have a conversation without him turning it to the subject of a previous relationship. I began to feel like even though he was with me, he was always thinking about somebody else. I felt so inadequate, I felt like I wasn't good enough for him and like he was always comparing me to another girl. It had completely broken me down. By the time we actually spoke about it, the damage was already done. I completely understand that this is all my fault, and I was so stupid for not speaking to him about it sooner, I should never have let it get as far as it did.

When I finally spoke to my boyfriend about it and told him how he had made me feel, he was absolutely mortified and he showed genuine remorse for making me feel this way. Since that day he has never spoken about a previous relationship, and it makes me feel like an idiot for not saying anything sooner, because now I see how easily it all could have stopped. 

But now, I'm left in a difficult place. I still have feelings of inadequacy even though he constantly compliments me, praises me, shows me he adores me and says lovely things about me. I still feel so insecure and I feel like this will never go away. My boyfriend is still friends with all of his ex's on Facebook - last year we had a conversation about that because a few of them still interact with his posts. One of his ex's comments on his Facebook posts regularly and will call him things like ""love,"" and ""darling,"" and another wished him happy birthday and at the end of the post she added ""we must meet for coffee and a catch up soon."" (Just to clarify: I know my boyfriend would never actually meet up with an ex, I trust him 100%, it just made me uncomfortable to see other girls speaking to him in this way.) I told my boyfriend that these interactions made me feel uncomfortable, and I asked if he would mind removing his ex partners as Facebook friends, but he point-blank refused and his reason was that removing people and blocking people is childish and it isn't how they deal with things where he comes from. I now understand l that I behaved in a toxic way by even asking him remove them as friends. I personally don't have any of my ex partners as friends on Facebook, because I'm not really interested in seeing what they're doing and I haven't remained friends with any of them in real life, so I don't see why we should be friends online. But I completely understand that everybody is different, and I have no right to ask him to remove anybody. 

I never wanted to become an overbearing, paranoid girlfriend, but I feel like now I am. I know I need to get over this, but I don't know how. I rarely use social media anymore because I feel like out of sight, out of mind is the best approach; if I don't see it then it can't bother me. I don't think about this situation anywhere as much as I used to, but every so often (like today) it resurfaces and causes issues. I so badly want to get over this, I want to feel confident again and I want to feel like I am enough for my boyfriend. At this point, I'm aware that I am the issue. When I asked my boyfriend to stop talking about previous relationships he stopped instantly, but he also made it clear that I could talk to him about my feelings regarding this any time I needed to. I know I should be speaking to him about it instead of posting on here, but I don't want to punish him for past mistakes, I just need to know how to move on."
"I’m in my first relationship and I keep overthinking things So I’m in my first ever relationship with this amazing and wonderful girl, we’ve been together almost 6 months and recently (since quarantine has begun) I’ve been overthinking a lot. I don’t know why I keep overthinking stuff; maybe it’s because it’s my first ever relationship and I love her so much and don’t want anything to happen to her? Maybe because I’m stuck at home and I’m alone with all my thoughts? Or is it just because of quarantine and I’ll get better after all this is over? I’m her third relationship, and she’s almost a year younger than me, but this is my first ever relationship. How can I stop overthinking things? I end up thinking about things she said and then I think things like “Did she mean it in this way? What if she meant it like this? How did this happen? How did that happen? Maybe it happened like this?” And then my brain goes on to create its own “worst-case” scenario of the thoughts. It’s awkward for me to randomly bring stuff up about her past relationships and she doesn’t always wanna talk about it too, which makes it a bit hard to get the thoughts out of my head.

I don’t like having these thoughts because I don’t want to think negatively at all because I love her a lot, and she loves me a lot, but I also have strong symptoms of OCD and I also have been having intrusive and obsessive thoughts recently since quarantine started - I never over-thought before quarantine started because we would regularly see each other in person, but now I can only see her through FaceTime calls :/ I also miss her a lot and a lot

Any help/advice please? Thank you :)"
"Is it wrong to call other people sexy when you're in a relationship Is it wrong to call People of the opposite sex sexy, hot, fine and to send the eyes emoji (👀) under their photos while you're in a relationship? Do you think it's wrong or am i overreacting? Because I feel it's being unfaithful to be saying and doing stuff like that when you're with someone"
"My (21 F) boyfriend (21 M) of two years got super drunk and became abusive towards me We were drinking with friends at their house for the night. It was a chill time. I went to bed because I was pretty tired and drunk. I wake up around 10AM, my boyfriend was still awake, he didn’t sleep all night, he was really drunk. They were still drinking, I didn’t feel like drinking because that day we were going to get picked up by my father in law to visit my boyfriends family, and I still had to pack. 

So we visited for a while but then he made up something in his mind that I did something terrible to him, it was like something switched in his mind that I am the bad guy, I did NOTHING. It was so delusional and I was so stressed. He went on for hours about how I treat him like shit. Yes I’m not a perfect girlfriend but what he was saying about me just wasn’t true. He even (My boyfriend) tried to fight my brother who was also drinking but luckily he de-escalated that. 

He has never behaved this way towards me. We went home- he was still so drunk and I was dead sober. I packed our clothes because his dad was on his way to pick us up. While I was packing he was yelling at me about how shitty, ugly, fat and terrible I am, at this point I was just listening and packing because anything I said only made him even more angry. Nothing I said calmed him down...I tried telling him I did nothing wrong.. He wouldn’t hear it, he wouldn’t believe it. I even resorted to apologizing to him (for something that did not happen) so he would maybe relax, that didn’t work. 

At one point he blocked our bedroom doorway so I couldn’t pack, but I managed to slip past him and that’s when he punched my back with both of his fists causing me to fall on the floor. I’m crying, he’s apologizing and crying too, I’m like “whatever it’s ok you’re just drunk let’s go.” So his dad texted saying he’s outside. So we go, my bf finally relaxes a little, feels bad because he punched me. I’m like whatever you’re drunk I know you wouldn’t ever do that sober. 

So we’re leaving the city but when I try interact with him at all he gets angry again. At this point it’s been about an 2 hours since we had left our friends place, but he still so drunk. So I’m just still silent as he goes off on me again. I can’t believe the way he talked and treated me in front of his dad, step-mother, and his brother (they also came along to pick us up in two vehicles, his dad and brother went into their other vehicle). 

At this point we’re driving and he’s talking to his step mom about how bad of a person I am, how no one even wanted me to come along, how he doesn’t love me, how fat and ugly I am. He saying all that right in front of me. I’m crying silently to myself because I know he’s drunk and I know nothing I say will help him relax. His step mom of course is getting mad at him for talking that way about me, but even she couldn’t calm him. He’s even being an asshole to her. So yeah it’s basically like that the whole time we travelled to his dads house, 2 hours away from the city. He finally passes out about an hour into travelling. It’s been about two days now, I feel dead inside. Yeah we talked about yesterday but all he said was that he was sorry and that he was just drunk but he says he remembers everything. I asked him “so you chose to treat me that way?”. This upsets him..he leaves. I’ve been crying all day yesterday and I did not get any sleep last night. When I try to talk about and tell him how terrible I feel about the way he treated me he gets angry, and blows it off. He thinks that just because he apologized everything is OK. He said “you act like I’m still doing it to you”. I don’t know what to do. I love him still but I have never felt this bad about myself in years. I am so depressed and unhappy and he doesn’t seem to care. What do I do :("
"Should I send her flowers? I was seeing someone/in a short relationship with someone up until recently. I broke it off, because my headspace is not in the right place for it at the moment. I didn’t feel like it was fair to her if I couldn’t give my 100% to the relationship. 

I still care about her, she still wants to talk.

Its her birthday soon, I want to send her flowers and wish her the best day. Should I, or is it weird?"
"GF wants to get a joint checking account, she’s in debt and I have a savings. she will contribute but not as much as she has more bills to pay, plus she has a kid. Down the road she wants to buy a house but thinks that if you have more you should put more down on the house. We have discussed this numerous times and I’ve voiced my concerns and she just gets upset and then screams, this happens with other types of arguments too that don’t go her way. Feel like I should run. Thoughts?"
"My (almost 18) bf's (16) mom threatens to call the police for dating her son This is a repost because my other post got taken down

So long story short, I have abusive parents. As a result, anything that goes on in my life they don't know about. My bf and I have been friends since August and started dating in January. We love each other dearly and frankly I can't imagine having a life without him. At first, his mom was fine with me. She knows how old I am and actually pushed her son into asking me out. Neither of them knew I liked him back but it made me chuckle knowing that his mom supported us as I've never had any support from my parents. Once we started daring, however, her attitude towards me immediately changed. She tried limiting contact, making snarky comments, and in general, her attitude towards me just changed. I've tried having a relationship with her as I've always wanted a mom but she didn't seem to want that back. (she knows I have abusive parents). My birthday is next week. She asked my bf what he was going to get me and he wasn't sure yet. From this, I thought maybe our relationship was getting better and I could always have the family I've always wanted but could never have. Until last night. His dad has always been indifferent towards me but suddenly I got this.

Hello OP,

I am bf's father.  You need to cease all forms of communication with bf, including Google Docs.  This will be the last time that I or my wife make this request directly to you.

Further incidents will result in reporting you to your parents or to legal authorities.

Sincerely,

Bf's dad

Idk what caused this to happen but I'm so scared rn. I haven't done anything illegal but to threaten contacting my parents is a new low. She Knows they're abusive and that they'll hurt me but she didn't care. Further more, bf had no clue. I got a hold of him tonight and he was Livid. Stormed out and started screaming. Saying ""If they can't hurt me they hurt you"" over and over. I'm so confused and hurt. I'm scared for both me and my bf. What do I do?

EDIT: Ok. Idk where ya'll are from but where I'm from our relationship is legal and protected by law. Before we started dating, we made sure of this. Please stop commenting on a 2 year age gap and help me. "
"Always wanting to hook up with older people Whether it's some random guy at the gym lockers or even my aunt I always want to secretly be fucking them. I don't know if it's because I was sexual abused by my brother or not, but the worst part is that I'm not of legal age yet but I'm still getting these fantasies. I want to ask people if they'll fuck me or if they wanna have sex in secret but I know that they won't and it drives me crazy. With both of my therapist I've wanted to have sex with them. 

Even when I try to stop I always come back. I haven't done it in awhile but I just want to. I've watched porn and it kinda helps but I always come back to it. I'm Transgender mtf so I can get into male bathrooms and locker rooms and with pretty much everyone naked in there I go crazy
What should I do?

Any help would be greatly appreciated"
"Is it wrong for me [23/F] to get irritated at frequent self-deprecating comments 2 of my friends [23/M] and [26/M] make towards me? I have 2 male friends, who've both expressed interest in me, but do not reciprocate these feelings for either of them. I've established that I would like to remain friends only as long as they are comfortable with doing so, which both of them have agreed to.

Both friend A and friend B are very good friends to me, and I cherish them as individuals and our friendship quite a bit. However, friend A tends to make frequent self-deprecating comments about himself, reflecting me undervaluing him in some way. 

For example, say if friend A wanted to call me, and I say I was preoccupied with something else and can't, he'd make a comment such as ""Wow, always too busy for me I see. I know I'm not good enough for your time lol"". Or if we're texting late at night and I suggest he go to sleep as he has work the next day while I don't, he'd say ""making excuses to not talk to me, I know. Just trying to get rid of me again 🙄"" both of these comments I'd clarify and say of course not and defend myself. Friend A would then respond with ""haha I'm just kidding, chill""

Friend B is starting to do similar. He would make comments like ""clearly I'm just so annoying to you"" which is absolutely not true. Again I'd clarify and express he's never annoying to me and nor ever a bother. Similarly, friend B would respond to me with ""chill it's just a joke, I can't even joke with you over text anymore""

I feel like I'm in a position where I can't express my irritation with these comments or else I'd be framed as the overly sensitive one who can't take a joke. It's not that I can't take a joke, it's just that I can't stand when self-deprecating comments imply that I undervalue the other person in some aspect without real reason, especially when I value these friends a lot. I just end up feeling guilty when these types of comments are thrown at me at random and it's really starting to bother me. I'm trying to be a bit more considerate knowing these 2 have feelings for me and I don't want them to feel like they're not good enough for me, they're just not my type in that sense (which I've expressed). I obviously value these friendships, but I'm starting to miss how these comments were never made before they both grew feelings."
"We don’t have sex often I’m with my girlfriend about 3.5 years now. The sex isn’t bad but it’s not amazing either . The one thing that mainly bugs me is how little we have sex . A few times a month max. She doesn’t really initiate it all that much. I feel like she has a much lower sex drive than me and it annoys me. I’m wondering.. is this normal after 3.5 years to have sex only a few times a month? I know there are other factors, but broadly speaking ?"
"I (18m) got in a fight with my girlfriend (18f). I want to start by saying that I think I was the asshole here because I was just eating and watching youtube while talking to her through texts.

Long story short, she asks me the ""who would you kiss, me for $100 or the hottest girl in the world for $800?""

My answer was ""you, but I feel that you'd kick my ass if I lose that much money. Still you ☺""

So then she sent me the real instagram screenshot of the guy who says ""so kiss you and get $900"" and I really felt bad by getting into that trap, I usually catch up but yet again I was multitasking.

Then I got angry because she asked said ""Where do I find one.."" regarding thr boy that says 900.

I feel like getting angry was my biggest mistake there but I really want to know if.. I am a true asshole here. We have a 1.5 year relationship and.. I think she may be reading this, so just say your honest opinion about this.

Thank you, redditors, have a great morning/day/evening/night!"
"Boyfriend constantly talking to female work colleague (So before anyone says ‘talk to him about it’ I have, he just tells me I’m paranoid and jealous and nothing is going on!)

So my boyfriend is constantly messaging a girl he works with on Instagram (I instantly thought that was shady because he doesn’t message anyone on Instagram, if I share a post with him on insta he doesn’t read it because ‘he doesn’t use the app). I wasn’t bothered at first because it was a message every now and again and I’d hate to be that controlling but now it’s constant! I brought it up to him and said it upset me a bit but like I said at the start of the post he says it’s nothing and I’m being jealous. But if she messages him he turns his phone over or acts like he didn’t see it if I’m near him... 

I don’t know if I am just paranoid and it definitely doesn’t help that she’s gorgeous and 110% his type! Not sure what to do just wanted to see if anyone who’s been in a similar situation could give me any advice?"
My gf has DID(formerly known as Multiple personality disorder) and don’t know if it something I can handle The title pretty much says it all. I have spoken to her other consciousness(not sure what to call them)and it’s a lot of work to deal with others and try to get her back to her self. She is very caring and is amazing there’s a lot of other problems about her I knew going into the relationship but I felt like I could help her and be patient enough but this just seems to be overwhelming me. I’m not sure if I should continue this relationship because of it but I really do love her and we were close friends before dating so it feels like I’m really losing someone important in my life. I’m not exactly too sure how this disorder works so it’s really frustrating for me. So should I continue to push forward or maybe end it because it seems this is not for me?
"My (18)BF is ghosting me. I'm a 21F who has been in a nearly three months relationship with an 18M. We got into a slight fight recently that he ended up over reacting with and now he's ghosting me.

It all happened that I said thank you (both of them have been helping me boosting my account on an online game) to someone he only met less than two days and when he sow the message he called it a cringy and a pathetic thing to say as it bothered his friend and also embarrassed him and said I should never talk to his friend again.

I told him I talk the way I want and he started to insult me and I scolded him for that as I told him a thousand times not to mock or insult me as it very much upsets me.

The last thing he told me was that I'm a very upsetting person and I should go fuck myself and not talk to him. It's been two days and he hasn't been answering my calls and leaving my texts on seen when I'm trying to fix this by trying to apology and saying I'll do anything for him to talk to me again. He hasn't removed me or blocked me from anything

I'm beyond upset and have been crying since that day, I need to know how I can let him to talk to me again or hear what he wants to do with our relationship; if it's still there. I don't know if he's saying that it's over or he needs time alone and to teach me a lesson."
"Getting Over Your First Relationship, and First Love. For the first time in over a month, I laid in bed and have had a good cry over my first relationship. I'm currently 20F. My ex, that I broke up with in November-ish, would be 26M. 

He was my first relationship. We dated for two years, and I loved him with all of my heart and sometimes I still feel it seeping through. But as I went to college and he moved far away, I broke up with him because I couldn't promise I'd be able to move away from my family  and life here after I graduated, and the distance was taking a toll on me as well. The breakup was long and drawn out. We went back and forth between fighting and then saying we wanted to be in eachothers lives. Leaving on bad terms and the sending a random message and ending up on good. 

He eventually sent me a letter saying he had cheated on me before the breakup happened. That was a whole nother mess. I wasn't even mad. I'm still not. I just took it as my fault for not putting enough effort into the LDR. After that though, I felt a little bit better in the fact that I made the hard decision to break up. 

However, lately I just keep getting that nagging feeling. I haven't dated or let myself have feelings for other people since. I've done casual things and just started feeling worse and worse about myself and more like maybe I made a mistake. But I also know there were solid reasons why we broke up. I just can't make myself want to find anyone else. 

I feel like it's too late. We already dragged our goodbyes out enough. I just don't know how to stop missing someone that was so important to me for so long. It's only been 6 months but every time I feel like I'm over him, I'm not. And I don't want to be that ex who messages someone out of the blue begging for forgiveness or even a scrap of what we used to have. 

So, Reddit. How did you get over your first love, and how do I?"
Lease? Do we both put our names on the lease when renting an apartment? How do you decide what's the safest way in case anything happens?
"My way or the high way This morning my (26F) boyfriend (30M) try to initiate sex but because i woke up this morning feeling extremely sweaty and hot in the bedroom I stopped it and said that I want to shower first because i felt absolutely gross. 

He then stopped what he was trying to do and attempted to go back to sleep. I asked him if he was okay because his voice seemed a little bit monotone and he said yes. five minutes later he jumps up, goes to the bathroom. Usually before he turns a light on he asks if he can turn the light on because I'm still in bed. today he just turned the light on, got dressed and went outside to buy pack of cigarettes. The cigarettes are an important part of the story, because he bought the cigarettes in order to be passive aggressive. He has a thing where if someone upsets him he'll do something in front of them and make sure they can see it something he knows they don't like or don't want just so that they know that he's upset. Sort of like sending a message. He's expressed verbally that he does this. Even does it to his grandmother and parents.

I was bothered by this, because I asked him if he was okay, and he said he was. He sits down and just start smoking cigarette after cigarette. okay, fine, I'll let him cool down. He goes to the bathroom, comes back and says he's going to his friend's house to workout at 12:30 pm. Again, through all of this he swears he isn't upset. 

anyway, long story short the issues that he feels rejected because I turned down sex. I turned them sex because I just wanted to take a shower before we do anything.  I have been susceptible to having a lot of health issues and I like to just take extra precaution because I don't have to deal with that. Especially in the time of a pandemic, when I can't get to the doctor as often as I would like to.. 

in short, I'm starting to feel like this is going to be the demise of my relationship. We have had our fair share of issues before, this isntthe first time he's been upset because I don't want to have sex when he wants it. The first time he was upset was because I just wanted to groom first. I don't like having sex without being groomed, it's a personal preference and it works for me and he understands that but decided to just shut down completely because he didn't want to deal with the idea of me denying sex when I didn't want it at the moment. 

we deal with things like gender roles those are big in this relationship, he says he's been taken advantage of in the past and I had to do everything for the woman that he stated, he's living his best life and its relationship with me, I'm pulling my weight, I spoil, I do whatever he wants of me and then some but when I just don't want sex because I want to shower he goes full-on passive aggressive. I don't know what to do here. It's frustrating me. It all feels totally unfair and just wrong. 

TLDR: my boyfriend is upset that I didn't want to have sex this morning because i was really hot and I felt gross as a result. Now he won't speak to me and is making me feel as if I'm the one that has the issue with him. Idk how or why he does this. I've been nothing but nice in this whole exchange. I don't know what to do but I'm absolutely tired of the B.S

Added: the reason I come to Reddit is because I don't have many close friends in relationships that can relate. I don't want anyone to have an opinion of him based off of an incident and hold it over my head and so I take to reddiit because sometimes I need an opinion but I just don't have anyone ask personally that may actually have something of substance to provide me with."
"I(M31) like a mutual friend (F32). She's best friends with my roommate (M30). I would like to ask her out. Should I ask my roommate if something's going on between them? I have known Sylvia for over two years. I met her through my roommate who went to same undergrad uni as her. I am good friends with my roommate. However, they exchange gifts, console each other over breakups, know each other's family members. It almost seems as if they might be a couple although without any intimacy. 

Now, I am an introverted guy, I never had such close friendship with any of my friends (men/women). So, I am not sure what to make out of this?

I really like this woman. Most of the times we three hang out together. But the few times I have spent time with her, I have found many things common between us.

Now, I would like to ask her out. But I don't know if I should talk to my roommate first? I am quite sure nothing going on between them. Also my roommate was dating Sylvia's sister last year. Didn't work out.

What should I do? Ask my roommate? Ask her directly?"
"I (23M) think and old friend of mine (23F) is playing me like a fiddle *I know this isn't exactly relationship advice, but idk where else to post it so please let me know if this isn't the right place!*

&amp;#x200B;

About 8 years ago me and this person were really close - we spent a lot of time together, made silly plans for the future,  the whole thing -, I loved her more than anything and she's told me multiple times she was into me too. Unfortunately nothing really happened because I was a stupid teenager boy and didn't know better. Time went by and we moved on with each other's lives, we both met other people and did other things.

Fast forward to quarantine times. Now she's in a relationship (questionable one but whatever) and decides to start messaging me again asking why I've been sort of ghosting her for the past years, so I took upon myself to aswer honestly and told her It's because regardless of time, it's difficult to see someone in a different light when they had such an impact on your life, so I thought it would be better if we just didn't talk. - Thats what you do right? Something doesn't work so you move on. - She then told me it makes no sense because that was 8 years ago (which I agree) and she'd really like to have a friendship if I was up for it. I then agreed to it, thinking it would be selfish of me to deny it just because my brain is being a jerk about things, and we started to talk again. 

A couple weeks pass, we've been talking almost everyday, and now for the third time she gets drunk late at night and keeps messaging me to reminisce on old memories of those days, asking for old pictures and bringing all sorts of things up, **knowing very well I told her I didn't want to keep doing that anymore** and that it hurt me to keep remembering those things.

In my head that can only mean 1 of 3 things: 

\- She's being sincere but just doesn't care about my well being as much as I care about hers.

\- She's a psychopath who's toying with me just for fun

\- She's the most innocent being on earth and doesn't realize what she's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the way to go about this? Am I getting played like an idiot? Should I keep a friendship with her or go back to not talking to her anymore? I would appreciate some outside perspective on this."
"Should I send this to my ex Pond 

Remember the day we stood next to a pond watching, the turtles swim while we talked about life. Then I looked you in the eyes and asked if you wanted to build a pond with me. you said yes and we started making plans. I wanted bass, and turtles in it. You wanted ducks and koi. We decided to build it before we turn 35 and have our 3 kids help us. While our dogs play in the background. I said it would be around 2 acres and a good distance away from the house so no snakes get close to it. And, When it was finished we could cuddle next to it and watch the turtles swim. Now that I don’t have you I realized I never wanted the pond. I just didn’t want that moment to end.

We broke up yesterday and I want to show her I care"
"Concerned for the person who’s ex(Andrew) left her for her flat mate (Lauren).. Does anyone know if she ever updated? But, girl wherever you are I hope you’re okay. (And not still living with them)."
"Boyfriend doesn't seem to appreciate or value me My boyfriend (23) and I (19) used to get along great in the beginning. We live about 30-40 minutes away from each other, but he was willing to make that drive after work for the first few weeks just to come see me. I finally felt comfortable enough to make that drive back to his place where he lives with his parents, but I noticed that once I started making that drive he started to come up with multiple excuses as to why he couldn't anymore. We were in our honeymoon phase, so we were staying with each other 5 or 6 nights a week. I was lucky if he'd make that drive one of those nights, but it wasn't something I was super concerned about. Now that we're out of our honeymoon phase I can clearly see some major issues that I'm not sure I wanna put up with long term without some change. He'll ignore my messages for hours, but gets upset if I accidentally do the same. He got angry with me when he noticed I stopped paying attention to the same work stories he'd told me about already (he works law enforcement). I tried to explain that if he's already told me the story 3 times that month, I didn't particularly want to keep hearing it. He swore I just didn't care for his work, but I just didn't care about those stories at that time. I apologized, and I think he moved on, but I'm just starting school, and he almost refuses to listen to anything about it. He even told me that my career of choice will be a waste of time and a waste of my life (defense attorney). He begs me to rub his shoulders or his feet but always says no when I ask him to return the favor. He doesn't respect when I make plans for us, and constantly changes them with little to no notice for me. Sexually, I'm the one doing the work about 80% of the time, and he acts like foreplay is a chore. I really liked the guy I started dating in the beginning. He was so sweet and made quite a few sacrifices just to come see me. I'm not sure if he's just checked out of the relationship and can be helped or if it was all an act from the beginning that he just couldn't keep up anymore. I'm always weary to break up with someone because I worry I'll regret it in a few months. Should I try and push him to be better or just cut my losses?"
"How do I (25F) bring up elective surgery to my partner (25M)? Elective surgery would be a cosmetic surgery, relatively non invasive and I have a consultation on Tuesday for pricing.

We've been dating and living together for just over a year now, despite the ""young"" relationship, our relationship is very stable, disagreements are rare and we're both incredibly easy going and very much love each other.

I'm in a stable job where I can relatively easily pay for a cosmetic procedure ($1000-3000) by either saving for a few months or paying off a loan as quick as possible depending on when I have it done (it'd just sting a bit to drop $1000 currently). Downtime, etc is not a factor when it comes to my work.

My boyfriend is in college, currently not working due to COVID, and has been wanting and needing a new computer for his field. His computer would cost about the same as my procedure. He has quite a bit of money saved up but personally I think he should save it as he's starting a much bigger university in the fall, and also in the event we need emergency funds.

We discussed taking out a loan on his credit line but with me paying the majority of it, due to his employment status and my income but my lack of credit, and for the fact that 1. I'll probably use his computer somehow, someday, 2. His computer is an investment in his success, and 3. He'll help out in other ways moreso *IF* paying off large chunks of this loan proves to be challenging (I'm talking 1/3 of the loan at each payment). Overall the loan will probably run $4000, with me paying out of pocket for my surgery and majority of it going to the PC first. So advice/insight on this is also appreciated.

Yes, we could wait but we're relatively financially comfortable for the summer right now with a major trip I planned being cancelled, and we're hoping to get his PC up and running before the fall semester. My procedure is just a selfish bonus in getting it done now vs later.

My issue is that I have never been a person to discuss my insecurities. I had before with my ex of 8 years who later turned around and used them against me, even during our breakup. I don't believe my current partner would do this at all, but even talking about the insecurities can bring me to tears, and I'm not a cryer.

I've brought it up to him that it is a small cosmetic surgery, nothing major happening to my face like a nose job, etc, but when it comes to recovery time, price, etc I'll obviously have to have this discussion. It's facial lipo but I have not said as much. It's something I've always struggled with even when I weighed less and is somewhat hereditary in the women in my family... Granted, I could stand to lose a bit more weight but even if I did, it'd still be there. If I could only choose 3 things to change about my appearance, this is #1. Likewise my self esteem has been absolutely tanking during this quarantine because my hormones are causing my hair to fall out and other issues, and I've gone from wearing makeup every day to hardly at all but my hormones are still wreaking havoc on my skin. I feel very shallow and vain but it's significantly impacting my happiness in ways I don't let my partner or anyone see, and I'm afraid of being vulnerable honestly, and with the added financial cost, I'm also concerned my partner will think it's a waste of time (unlikely as I know he cares about my happiness, but the concern is still there).

tl;dr: looking to have a cosmetic procedure due to serious insecurities and am unsure how to bring up what the actual procedure is to my partner."
"Just recaught my cheating fiance, again. Now, how do i start the process of leaving when i have no one? To start, I’ve caught my finance cheating back in 2018 when i discovered a plethora of sexy convos between him and random chicks around town. I told him that if I ever found anything like this again, that I’d leave - a clear set boundary on what i find acceptable/unacceptable. After this initial discovery, he opened up about having an extremely high libido (i struggle with a low libido, that im trying to pinpoint the cause of). In the months and months of this healing process; opening up to one another, etc - we discussed the prospects of opening our relationship a little bit &amp; bringing in another female partner as a way to explore his high sex drive in a way that was exciting to me (im pansexual). It’s gone well, we’ve communicated openly about our girlfriend &amp; always keep the mindset of him+me and our girlfriend is separate from us. All is well &amp; good, we are exploring sexual fantasies, working on communicating a little bit better, trying to get through the turmoil without losing eachother.. but that trust that went missing after discovering his phone in ‘18 has always been a pervasive afterthought. every time he’d be on his phone (which is all the time), I’d begun ruminating on the idea that he was definitely on with someone else. there was always a feeling that he was definitely entertaining other women.. even if i didnt have concrete evidence, i always had this feeling. I asked for some transparency, specifically regarding instagram DMs, because thats where I’ve caught all of his transgressions. He refused &amp; said he has a right to his privacy &amp; he doesnt have to share that info with me. Gotta respect that.. i mustve been crazy for even asking, right? A knee jerk response to mistrust, right? but after a year and a half of being the overly anxious gf, constantly checking in, constantly asking “who’s that?” &amp; receiving his reassurance (&amp; sometimes his aggressive annoyance), I decided that it was time to start working on why I still feel the trust hasnt been repaired enough for me to move past my feelings of paranoia. I’ve attempted the work, picked up a couple of self help books and currently trying to find a therapist that won’t break my bank.

Fast forward, I still feel this paranoia today, and although I’ve tried to address it, i cant shake it. Tonight, he fell asleep on the couch with his phone open. &amp; i’m such a self-loathing POS that i went ahead and scoured every corner for evidence of what i thought was happening. Jackpot. 2 ex’s on DND, 1 random chick in his insta DMs that he’s asking to take on a date post-quarantine, he’s been chatting with our girlfriend separately from me in inappropriate ways, and he’s even gone out of his way to tell one of his potential lady-companions that I think they’re cute so as to not raise suspicion amongst those ladies that know he and I are engaged.....

I have never felt more betrayed, stupid and small. But What i do remember is promising myself that small boundary that i told him i would hold: I found him cheating again, the same way he cheated before &amp; now its time for me to go. I love him so much, even now through the hatred for his actions and his disrespect for us, i still love him. I’ve been committed to him for 5 years, and planning a beautiful life - ripping it away from myself feels like i’m self-sabotaging. Am I? Any advice on this is great, anything encouraging to make me feel less crazy is appreciated. My family life is shaky, so going back home isn’t an option i’d like to explore &amp; the majority of my friends are already in current rental leases. Whats the best first step in leaving? Should i even bother confronting him? What advice can you offer on how to separate when lives are VERY intertwined - possibly to codependent levels? What are the most empowering parts of independence that I can focus on &amp; look forward to relative to my situation? Do you have any tips to keep mental health in check during these emotional times? TIA,x"
"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) and his best friend’s (18F) relationship is making me uncomfortable. So, my boyfriend and his best friend, I’ll call her Rachel, are quarantining together right now, and it’s making me realize how uncomfortable I am with their relationship. 

They met a long time ago and have been very close for a long time. Probably because my bf is a few years older than Rachel, they have developed a very older brother / younger sister relationship. This is mostly because of the fact that Rachel’s family has failed her in a lot of ways, which I kind of thing has made her seek “family” elsewhere, and my bf was already helping her through a lot of her issues. When they first met, Rachel had a crush on him, but swears up and down that that was before she saw him as a brother, and now would be really uncomfortable with their relationship including any romantic aspect. 

The thing that bothers me is not only that she used to have a crush on him, but also that they do a lot of things that I consider bf/gf things. For example, she will fall asleep resting on his shoulder, wear his sweaters, grab his hand to show him something, sit with her feet in his lap, etc. She completely stopped doing all those things with me around once I brought it up and apologized profusely, but I’m pretty sure she’s the same when I’m not around. On his end, he will do stuff like make it clear he’s thinking of her when I feel he should be thinking of me. For example, we were on a date at a fair and he won two of those huge stuffed prizes. He did give me one, but saved the other one to give her... Which just makes me feel like he was thinking of her the whole time. 

Now, with them in quarantine, I can’t help but overthink them spending so much time together. She’s staying with him because her university closed and she didn’t want to go home due to the family issues mentioned earlier. When I’ve mentioned to my boyfriend how she stresses me out, he is very understanding but reminds me that he treats her exactly the same as he treats his younger blood sister, would never do anything with her, etc. I think another thing adding to my anxiety is that she is like, stunningly gorgeous, and more in my boyfriend’s league than I am, so maybe this is all just insecurity. She is tall, thin, pretty, basically everything I’m not. 

If I made an ultimatum, I honestly think he’d choose her over me, considering he’s known her for longer and also because I suspect he’s done the same with past girlfriends. Is this a red flag? Am I just being insecure?"
"My (23F) boyfriend (22M) is making me feel guilty for being upset about him not following social distancing Please no one shit on me or be mean in the comments bc I really cannot handle it rn. Sorry this is long thanks if u take the time to read it. 

My boyfriend and I have been together well over a year and have both been quarantined together since all this started - our apartments are like 5 minutes apart and neither of us have roommates, sometimes we stay apart but we only interact with each other so whatever. 

I have multiple chronic health conditions that may or may not put me more at risk for COVID19, not much research has been done into it but tbh I’m not taking any chances bc I know my body literally hates me. I have not seen my friends or family in 2 months and am moving across the country in a couple of weeks without seeing them before I go, which is heartbreaking. My bf just graduated from college and his family wanted to have a get together this weekend. 6-7 people, from 4 different households, NO masks or social distancing followed at this gathering. Hugging and all. He also wants to stay at his parents and spend mothers day with the group. 

I expressed that I am really not comfortable with the entire thing as it is not following social distancing and is a huge risk. His dad still has to go to work and so he has been out, and he really has no idea what his sister and her boyfriend (they don’t live together) have been up to. However when I brought it up he became extremely defensive and basically shifted all the blame onto me, making it seem like I don’t “trust” that his family has been taking proper precautions and that I am ruining such a big moment by saying this and trying to create a problem. 

I told him he can still go, I just wouldn’t feel comfortable being around him for two weeks afterwards. The problem is, I will be moving in two weeks so this is basically our last opportunity to spend together for a few months (he is not moving until later). I can understand how this seems like an ultimatum, but I really am just concerned for my own health. He just continued with saying a lot of stuff to make me feel guilty and I kept pointing out that it’s not like I personally started a global pandemic, I completely understand that he is upset and disappointed, and that EVERYONE has things they are missing due to covid. He eventually decided he wouldn’t go but was so anxious about calling his parents he waited until 8 pm the night before. I guess it didn’t go well when he called them, he said he was so anxious and upset about it he was just crying and not really able to express what the issue was. He said his parents were just really baffled and didn’t understand what the problem was. They ended up calling him back and telling him how sad and upset they were that he wasn’t coming home, that they bought a cake and food etc., and that his mom was really upset he wouldn’t be spending mothers day with her. After this call he decided he IS going to go home after all, but he is still a wreck bc now he is all upset he is not going to see me before I move. (As am I). 

I told him I think it wasn’t right of his parents to respond that way, and that it isn’t his responsibility to make sure they aren’t upset but rather the other way around. He said he told them about my health conditions and they didn’t see the problem. My point is that if they really cared how he was feeling and wanted to have him come home and ALSO reduce his anxiety, why couldn’t they offer to wear masks and social distance properly? (Yes I’m aware still not the best idea, but at least meeting in the middle slightly). This is apparently not even an option, which I think is ridiculous. 

However the biggest problem is now my boyfriend has completely turned this entire mess around so that it is somehow MY fault. He is going on and on about how he can’t believe I have turned this into such a big deal, how I haven’t taken into account his feelings about wanting to celebrate with his family, how he’s sorry that I don’t understand how important mothers day is (my mom is abusive and we are estranged) but he cannot even fathom not being with his mom on mothers day, how i can’t recognize that he thinks it is safe and not a risk of getting sick so there’s no problem (???), etc. 

I am absolutely crushed at this entire thing and how he is handling it, and I have no idea what to do. If he just wants to be selfish and expose himself by spending time with his family, he has every right to I guess, but I don’t think it is fair to crucify me and make me feel like I am doing something so wrong by having to look out for my own health. He is normally so supportive, kind, and open minded and I just feel so betrayed and alone rn. I don’t even see any way of realistically moving past this and I think that is what is so overwhelming, I feel completely lost."
"How do I (22F) tell my husband (24M) that I am considering a career in the military? My husband recently got out of the military due to him not liking it. It messed up his body and now receives disability. We have been together and married throughout his military career, so I know how rough it can be.

&amp;#x200B;

My husband, then boyfriend, chose a job in the military he didn't like. He chose it for the large bonuses and that's why he hated the experience the whole time. It was like a chore for him.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently graduated a local university in our city with a bachelor's in cyber security. I want to get into the Cyber Security realm of IT. I think it's amazing how far technology has come to where we need specialized people just to keep it secure! I grew up working on computers and fixing them. It's what I want to do. The problem is though, you need a clearance for those jobs. Companies need to trust you to keep their systems secure, I understand that. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I did find a company that is willing to sponsor me, I would have to sign a contract with them to work a certain amount of years, just like the military.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been applying to new positions since I received my diploma. Even places that require those clearances. I've been rejected time and time again due to not having a clearance, I'm tired of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am considering joining the military as an officer for the cyber security program that the base in our city has. I think it would be a great experience to receive a clearance, have our finances in order, and if I don't enjoy it, I can leave at the end of the contract. I am okay with relocation since we are hoping to move out of the city eventually. Plus I am trilingual.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my husband will not be happy if I bring this up. He absolutely despises the thought of the military due to his experience. If anything, I just want our future to be set from my qualifications and career.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I talk to him about this? What would I say? I wouldn't want a divorce because of this, but I really can't find any positions in my field without a clearance. If it helps too, I was going to join the military before I met him. 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Husband is a disabled vet, hated his experience in the military because he chose a job he didn't like. I am considering joining because my career field needs a clearance &amp; it is a field I enjoy."
"No trust My wife of 23 years doesn’t trust a thing I do and basically stalks my every move.  Granted I’ve given her reasons in the past not to trust me.  It’s my fault !!  I get it.   But how long do I keep trying to reprove myself before I lose my mind??  It’s been over 5 years now since I screwed up.   5 Lonnnnngggggg years.   I love her and she is a very good woman but ...but... there is no trust.   Very taxing and annoying to be stalked constantly.  I’m thinking about separation and letting her find someone else but doubt she’ll trust them either 🙄.  I just want her to be happy, unless I’m feeding her or fucking her, she pretty much is ☹️ unhappy"
"Quasi racist people So I was hanging out with this girl I met on bumble and things have been cool, but we went for a walk and the first black dude she saw she said a bunch of weird shit to me and although it wasn't hateful or anything it was super weird and I'm not sure what to do. I get she isnt from the us and that Asian countries have a stereotypical etc view like that sometimes but I havent dealt with anything this wild

Ive cut off racists and generally people that are white for this reason and I thought maybe straying towards other people this would happen less, but I have no good solution or answer to this problem tbh"
My (21M) boyfriend (19M) told me that i’m going to be trans if i got rhinoplasty We have been dating for 2 months and he is so sweet. I’ve always wanted to have nose job since forever and this summer i’m going to have enough money to book for a surgery. I told my bf about it but he hated my idea and his response was too dumb. Because his ex got some things done and after then he became trans. So he’s afraid of me turning into trans.
"This is kind of long overdue but I cannot move on properly knowing i was technically blind to what has happened between us. It has been almost 5 months since we stopped dating but somehow I still cant move on properly. I have this strong gut feeling that while we were dating he still secretly liked someone? I can say this because now, he seems to still have feelings for this certain person that he liked before me. He kept saying things that he has been faithful all the time to her and maybe that goes way back when we were still dating?? I cant be quite sure though but maybe that could also be the reason why he left. He just said that I deserve better and left. He never gave me a proper closure and couldnt even look me in the eye. 

What made me think of all these was because we were kind of in a LDR relationship so who really knows what he be doing back there when I was away. 

I know i should just move on but I just cant have my peace of mind. It just hurts me to think that all those time, my love for this person could not have been genuinely reciprocated.

Do you think my gut us right? or am i just over reacting?"
"My bf puts more effort into being a fun person with his friends than with me. I am 22f and he is 22m. My bf appears to put a lot more effort into being a fun chipper human being than when he is with me and it makes me feel bad. Anytime he plays video games with his friends he sounds super enthusiastic and more loud and excited to be around them, but with me he is so serious. He definitely laughs(not often) and makes jokes about stuff but he doesn't do it the same way he does with them at all.

Like he tells me sometimes how he is sorry he is boring around his family and my friends and parents, yet he has the energy to act personable and exciting and funny around his friends? He is generally quiet and laid back when with me and pretty much everyone but his friends.

When he is with them he seems to be this different person? Maybe he is just trying to fit in with them and be cool but it feels like kind of a stab in the back that he doesn't put this same effort into interacting with my parents and friends the same way he acts with these people.

I'm sure it has to do with the fact he is more comfortable and doesn't have to put up an act around me, but it just comes off a bit annoying since he can't be bothered to put that type of effort into talking with my friends and family and even HIS family that way."
Someone please help me! I feel like I’m at my breaking point I know this is the wrong subreddit but I really need help and I feel like ending everything right now I just can’t do this anymore. I’ve never been able to get the help I need. I just want someone to help me but I shouldn’t be asking the internet but right now that’s all I have. I don’t know what to do. I just feel so depressed and I just don’t care if I live or die.
"Help I’m running out of things to talk about So a bit before the quarantine I started talking to my crush that knows that I like her and I know she likes me, but we are both very shy to make a big move like ask on a date or something like that so we are just having casual talks and getting to know each other first. Up until about a week ago we would text pretty much daily but I’m starting to run out of things to say so I’m contacting her less and less but I don’t want her to think I’m not interested, and I’m also pretty bad at flirting and texting in general, any advice?      Also sry if English is bad it’s not my first language

Edit: if it helps I’m 17 nearly 18 and she is the same age as me"
"My SO is secretly a “financial dom” and I don’t know how to handle this. So me (M20) and my SO (F21) have been together for 2.5 years. We went through a rough patch a couple months ago, but after some conversations and a period of time where we tried to be friends, we decided to try and make a long distance relationship work. We haven’t seen each other in person since.

Last night I found a profile of a “financial dominatrix” on a social media account and I could tell from the pictures and from some of the things she said that it was her. She was talking about getting money from “paypigs” and was offering to send people “content” for money. I’m not trying to knock what other people are into, but as far as our relationship goes, this makes me uncomfortable and I feel kind of humiliated.

I don’t pretend to have been perfect in the relationship, but I don’t know where this came from. I didn’t really get any indication that she was interested in this sort of thing. I definitely was not supposed to see this, but I think I need to bring this up.

Feeling dumb and hurt, and I could use some advice."
"Hate hearing about my boyfriend's uni life/uni friends When my boyfriend talks about how fun uni was for him, fun experiences, or about any of his friends associated with his uni I hate it. He had a girlfriend for 3.5 years during uni (who he apparently wasn't serious with). Luckily he doesn't talk about her or go in to any detail on that. But I just always associate anything uni related with her.

Am I wrong to feel this way?"
"I (25/M) messed up with my online friend (23/F) and they seem to be slowly walling me out; how should I handle this? So, I've been talking to a friend online since a couple months ago; it's been pretty on and off, but we've mainly talked about our interests and played video games together, and I thought things were fine. I was happy with the way our friendship was going.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago she left me off during a regular text conversation, and actually became more inactive on social media than ever. I had assumed she was just busy, but a little while later she messaged me saying that I was doing something that made her self-conscious and uncomfortable:

 We use Twitter as our main platform; every now and then I was saying the same things as her (like, almost verbatim); it made it difficult for her to react to and she was clearly uncomfortable once she came to me about it. I actually didn't have in mind how she'd feel beforehand.

In short, I cordially told her I was sorry and I wouldn't do it again. This was a couple days ago. But tonight I happened to pick up on her removing me from the friends section of a couple mobile games (everything else was intact).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm getting seriously worried. She comes across to me as the kind to step back and reflect by herself in the face of conflict, as I had absolutely no idea what was going on before she talked to me about the issue. I'm thinking I should text her saying, ""hey, I'm worried and wanted to make sure you were okay"" or something. But it's been literally two days and I want to give her space before that, but the anxiety in me is also pining over the idea of her blocking me entirely during then. What exactly should I do?

EDIT #2: Originally I left the core issue ambiguous but decided fuck it and copypasted it from a comment reply. "
"Help contacting an old friend. So, backstory, it was 2 years ago, in grade 8, I was 13M at the time and I met this girl, we’re both introverts and we didn’t like being with a lot of people, we actually both for once having a trusted friend, and I started being in lover with her (14F), we’ll call her &lt;3, others say that she was also in love with me. Her best friend was in grade 9, she was older but that dodn’t really stop them of being together, this is important for the rest of the story. January, still grade 8, we come back from Christmas and she didn’t come to school, in fact, she never came back to school, I texted her about it and she didn’t want to talk about it. Later, in march, during March break, I was going on a school trip to California, it was purely a fun trip, nothing educational. It was for grade 7, 8 and 9 and her friend (we’ll call M). So M was there along her other friend, C. They were both, how to say it, somewhat cliché, you know, those girls that always have fake nails and makeup, goes to starbuck, and always on instagram checking up their likes. Yeah..... so I actually got approched by them as they knew I was friend with &lt;3. I spent my days with them. One night, we were on Pier 31, in SF, CA. I was texting &lt;3 and we actually got a long convo, something we didn’t get in a while, of course, my battery died, I was able to tell her, but on convo was long from being over. During that convo, she talked how now she was home schooled and that she was moving out, it’s was really far, she moved out a few cities, but she would be like, 1h30 min away from here. I was semi okay with it, but accepted it and yeah, that was the last time I talked to her, since then I tried adding her snap, she was active on it but I could try, instagram, on her 3 accounts, no answer, she didn’t even see my messages. 

Now a year ago, I was 14, I messaged her friend, M to know if they were still talking to eachother, she said yes, just that answer made it all seem so unfair. I asked her if she was still active on instagram, and if not if I could get her contact elsewhere, she said no she isn’t active on insta. I’ll tell you the way ahe say it:
No she isn’t active on insta, I’m with my BF now so Bye.

Now, 2020, I’m 15, and last night I realized how I miss her a lot, like... I almost forgot about her, and I dreamed about her and now she can’t get oht of my head. I don’t know how to get in contact with her, and if i do, what to say to you know, re-establish things.

Thanks, please upvote, it’d really help me.

"I (F/21) don’t know how to flirt with a guy (M/22)! Can anyone help? I’m (F/21) conversing with a mate (M/22) right now from uni and he occasionally makes a flirty comment within our conversations.

Asked my friend out So I may or may not have had some drink last night and I asked my friend out. I dont even like her in a romantic way I was just being a dumb ass. It made her feel uncomfortable and this may end our friendship. I've apologised but she wont even look at my texts. Can i salvage this or just sit in the dark and cry?

"Should I delete my message? Long story short this girl I’m talking to and I are going through some issues because of her parents and we can’t talk anything out until she has time to herself which we both don’t know when; we just got off our 1 week of “space” period 2 days ago and she told me she has a lot to say but couldn’t atm (that was yesterday)

So anyways today I saw that she took off her bracelet that I made her and that we both wore... I called her out on it on snapchat and basically said “you took off ur bracelet 🥺”.

The thing is she’s not awake yet so there’s still time to delete it... should I? I don’t want to seem clingy after everything but also I can’t stand not knowing why she took it off. I’m scared"
"BF self-flagellates and it bothers me. Hi, first of all let me start by saying that the situation I'm in isn't particularly normal, and I know many of you will disapprove. Still, I feel like to get the best advice possible, I need to explain matters truthfully, so here I go.

My bf (20) is five years older than I am. Before any of you ask, this isn't the part that bothers me. 

I met my bf about half a year ago and we started out as nothing but friends. Slowly but surely, we grew very close and we've now been together for about three months, and he's been nothing but kind to me.

I grew up in a family that's been doing drugs (like meth) since before I was born, and as such I've not exactly had the privilege of growing up in a stable, loving household. In many ways, my bf is more of a father figure to me than my own father is. He comes to my plays, he checks up on me daily and makes sure I don't lack anything I need. When I'm sad he's there for me, and when I'm happy he's glad to share those moments with me.

Before any of you say so, we've not had any sexual intercourse yet despite me now practically living at his place; He's adamantly refused to do so as he has confessed to me that he already feels bad for being with me in the first place due to our age difference, and that it somewhat makes him feel like a pedophile, which I can understand in a way. Still, I do not wish to lose him as he is the best man I've ever met.

As I stated earlier, I stay at his place(my parents couldn't care less about me). He's given me my own room, and soon we'll start to decorate it which I'm pretty excited for. 

Now that I've given this bit of backstory, I feel like I can adress the issue now.

I noticed that at certain hours (in the morning and in the evening) I would hear weird sounds coming from his room. I never paid much attention to it as I figured it must've been some type of machinery or something that made those sounds. Still, a couple days ago my curiosity picked and I gave into it.

I watched him self-flagellate himself trough a peek in his door. He doesn't know I saw him, nor do I want him to as I feel he really doesn't want me to know about it (yet).

I would be lying if I said I was okay with this, and it makes me sad that this man who goes out of his way to help others harms himself in such a way. I know for a fact it's not a religious ritual as he doesn't know if there is a god or some kind, nor does he care much for it.

Is there any way I could bring it up to him in a non-hurtful way that I know that he does that, and that it pains me to see him mutilate his own body in such a way?

Thank you for reading trough this wall of text, I did my best to format it in a readable fashion."
"She is confusing me Met a girl online 2 years ago. We started talking 24×7. I fell for her and told her the same. She said she likes me but doesn't feel love yet. She said she takes time in these things. I told her I want to know her for life even if we dont end up together. She was happy. We were going strong. Talking non-stop sharing everything.shared pics,exchanged numbers .
A year ago she got job. So we stopped talking all the time like before. Her job is pretty hectic and she doesn't have much energy. So she used to sleep after coming home talking 10 15 minutes with me. I started suspecting her. She said please trust and try to understand. She said when she works she forgets everything. 

But I didn't listen and used to force her to talk with me even when she was sleepy af. Daily arguments and fights. 

This january I was angry and said let's end this. She said what about knowing each other for life. I said no point. We didn't talk for one week.

I texted her after one week and she said it's not game. U can't go and come back to my life whenever I feel like. She said how is this supposed to work with this behavior. She said u behave like u own me

After two days she said she likes some new guy at work. And said we can only be friends nothing more. She said she has a gut feeling we can never be together. She said we are toxic for each other.

So this started my gloomy life. She is confusing me now. Sometimes she and the new guy are dating .sometimes they are not. Sometimes she even forgets about the new guy and talk to me like we used to . 

I know this is hard to believe how can I be in love with girl I met online. But I truly love her.

What should I do now?
I think she is lying about new guy bcoz she wants me to move on. 
Please help.

Edit: sorry if there are typos and grammatical mistakes. Posted from mobile. 

And I am ready to answer any follow up questions bcoz  the story is very long"
"My boyfriend (21M) is talking his ex but he lied to me and told me he wasn't. My boyfriend has been talking to his ex, which normally I wouldn't mind (I honestly believe its ok if he was friends with her). But I repeatedly asked him before if they were in contact and he swore to me many times they were not. Some ways he contacted her were by swiping up on her story, and initiating a conversation, and he made a private snapchat story where he added her to be able to view it but not me. His explanation for this was that he posted something about April always being a shitty month for him. And we were arguing in April and his ex and him broke up during an april so he wanted her to feel bad too (which doesn't make too much sense to me). The reason I know this is because I logged into his snapchat, which I am truly ashamed of because it was so wrong. However, he's looked though my phone numerous times before. In addition, in the past he would get insecure and upset when I would talk to one of my guy friends, so I cut off relations with that guy friend in the meantime for him to work on his insecurities. I am upset that (1) he lied and (2) he wanted me to not be friends with that guy friend but he was going behind my back and doing exactly what he told me not to do with his ex. Anyways, I confronted him about it he apologized about it. I told him he could be friends with his ex if he wanted to as long as he is open to me about it. I also told him he is going to have to be ok with my friendship with that guy friend. Even though we came to this solution, deep down I just don't understand why he lied to me so much when I have just been open with him about literally every aspect of my life. In this moment, I want to trust him again, I just don't. We both did some toxic things to each other, but I love him and I want to keep dating him. However, I do not know if thats the right thing to do though."
"My cousin’s (25m) girlfriend (23f) is jealous/envious of me (24f) and my boyfriend (29m). What should i do? Here’s the breakdown: my boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and whenever we hangout at my stepmom’s place, my cousin always seems to bring his girlfriend around. 

Since they became official in their relationship, I noticed that his girlfriend has been trying to emulate me. One day, she came in and asked me about my new hairstyle and then said “I’m gonna do my hair just like that”. The following week, when I went to my stepmom’s place to pick up one of my duffel bags I had left, she had the exact same hairstyle that I currently have. 

It doesn’t stop there - my boyfriend and I noticed that she also picked up on my fashion style, my lingo (how casual I am around people and the way I talk), and got a similar duffel bag to the one I had picked up. She also went as far to tell my cousin (her boyfriend) that I’m jealous of her and that I’m trying to be just like her.

She’s been studying me since day one, which creeps me out. She’s not interested in being friends with me, all she pretty much does is gossip about me to my cousin whenever I’m around. She hides her mean streak by tidying up around the house and her boyfriend’s room. It sucks because it seems like nobody can see through her bullshit except me and my boyfriend, and my cousin doesn’t even stand up for me."
"How to go about blocking my “best friend” after she led me on? I (22X) have this friend (24F). We’ll call her Stacia. 

I’ve been interested in Stacia as more than a friend since we met at the end of 2017. But she was in a committed long-term relationship for most of the time we’ve known each other, which I always respected. 

Around fall last year that changed. And then come december she starts hitting on me really hard. It progresses to the point where she tells me she loves me, and she sends me explicit messages on the regular. I’m on cloud nine. 

Five months pass with just texting between us. But recently I was able to see her just once, to take her out for her birthday. I spent $100 on gifts and took her on a short road trip. 

Now, I didn’t expect anything in return for the gifts. I love(d) her. Love, to me, isn’t transactional like that. But I was still (kind of) surprised that she recoiled when I even tried to touch her on the shoulder. I come to find out, it all meant nothing to her. I was just someone she would sext when she was drunk and alone. I kind of suspected as such. But it really hurt. 

She didn’t really even own up to what she did or apologize at all. Everything was framed in terms of how *she* felt. 

“I feel bad.” vs “I’m sorry I hurt you.” and “I might have sent mixed messages” rather than the truth, which is that she led me on for five months knowing that I liked her for two years already at that point. 

It really felt like a slap in the face listening to her talk and realizing through her words she only ever cared about how this affected her. Not me. She even told me that she didn’t want to hear that I was hurt, but she would hear me out... because she thought it would probably be good for her to hear. She only acknowledged my pain because it benefited her. That felt awful. 

It’s been a week since that happened, and I haven’t talked with her since then. She seemed relieved after it all, and even posted that it was the best birthday she had in six years. Which I think is so messed up. I was fine being friends. I wish she never would have started something she didn’t want. 

We ended the night on an amicable note, with the idea that we’d stay friends. But I’ve changed my mind since then. 

I realized tonight, thinking about how disrespectfully she treated me and how she couldn’t even admit to what she did, let alone say sorry, that I don’t want to be involved in any capacity with someone like her anymore. I don’t want to get dragged back in and feel like I’m on her leash again. I don’t want to beg for her time anymore. So I blocked her on everything, except basic texting / calling. 

My dilemma is this — I can see in hindsight that she never cared about me. I had these puppy eyes for her. But she never loved me on my terms. Only hers. Would ignore me all the time. So hot and cold. So, I feel like I shouldn’t care about how she feels either. But I do wonder if it’s too callous to ghost completely without saying anything. 

I don’t even know what I would say. Nothing would make this better. And I don’t want to ghost for the pettiness of it at all... Her unhappiness would bring me no joy. I just know that this relationship isn’t good for me, and maybe it’s shitty, but it seems so much easier to just ghost than to try to give closure to someone who never cared about my peace of mind. advice? 

TLDR; my best friend of 2.5 years led me on, revealed she doesn’t care about me. i decided to block her on everything except basic texting. should i let her know that i’m done with the friendship or just ghost?"
"My ex bf thinks I’m crazy. It’s driving me insane My ex bf (27M) broke up with me over the text, when I tried to talk to him in person on that day, (long distance. 2hrs of flight. I had no intention to show up at his house, I did book a flight but I cancelled later) he blocked me on everywhere saying I’m not normal to come. I thought that was the right thing to do at that time and I loved him. I tried to reach out a few times via a letter and a text, apologizing for reaching out and explaining him why I felt like I needed to talk to him in person, and that I would work on my problems, but the more I try to fix things, the more he thinks I’m crazy. So I stopped. I later found out that he posted saying how people only think of one person creeps him out too much, which is me creeping him out. Am I really crazy for acting this way once it’s over/after being blocked? In this case, do people just walk away without explanation? We were dating for 1.5 years (relationship was sort of complicated, and couple months since relationship became official)
I was the one always trying more to mend our relationship throughout the year.

This is literally driving me insane, and I’m heartbroken. I know I can’t change what ex thinks of me and that it shouldn’t matter cause he is my ex. But am I crazy?? I have a trauma now and I’m going to see a therapy."
"[UPDATE] My husband (40M) is a university professor and I (26F) fell in love with his student (21M). [My original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gellyk/my_husband_40m_is_a_university_professor_and_i/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I know I did a horrible thing and no one should pity me. I just don't have anyone to talk to right now. Feel free to tell me what a horrible person I am. I know I'm not the victim, far from it, and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm trying to make myself seem like the victim.

My daughter has been staying at my sister's place for the past two weeks. Today my husband and I talked. We talked about everything, we both cried, a lot, and we came to a conclusion that the best thing we can do for each other and for our daughter is to get a divorce. I am still in shock and I can only imagine what my husband is going through right now. He deserves so much better and I hope he finds it. We still haven't figured out what's going to happen to our daughter but my husband will most likely be the one to take custody of her.

I went to see my daughter yesterday and my sister hit me and yelled at me for destroying a perfect marriage (she of course didn't do it in front of any of  the kids). And I deserved it, I deserve so much worse. She's told all our friends, I probably won't be able to look any of them in the eyes anytime soon. She's also told our dad and he called me to tell me what a piece of shit I am as well. I've even gotten a death threat from my husband's brother. And as much as I deserve it all, it's been really tough.

I have been staying at a hotel because I wanted to leave my husband alone and my sister didn't want to let me stay at her place. I've been trying to avoid A, obviously. He's asked me if I needed help or somewhere to stay or someone to talk to but I said no. We have been texting for the past few hours and I feel so awful but at the same time it helps a tiny but because at this point he's the only person that doesn't treat me like garbage (although that's what I am) and I don't know, I literally don't know who else to talk to (I will be seeing a therapist as soon as the pandemic situation calms down, it's really bad over here in my country). Is it even okay that I'm talking to A? I don't feel like it is but I don't have anyone else right now. My best friend is also a friend of my husband and since she knows about everything (heard about it from my sister) I don't feel comfortable talking to her... I feel ashamed. And guilty. And disgusting.

I am glad that my husband is doing a bit better. He's working again. I wish I could do something to help him but I know I can only make things worse. I want him and my daughter to be happy with or without me.

Is it okay that I'm talking to A? Venting to him? I feel so pathetic posting about this on Reddit but again I have no one else to talk to. Thanks if you take time to read my post."
"I (23M) just found out my Gf (21F) is a virgin, and now I want to break up I been dating this girl for two months and it’s going well so far. we haven’t done much in the bedroom due to her being in college and in general taking things slow. We talked about ex’s so I knew she has been in a couple of relationships and I assumed they had sex. Last night we got into a moment and we were going at it when we stopped. Turns out she only has had sex with one guy and it was drunk sex. “They did not do anything really”, and her ex had whiskey dick so it was nothing really. 

This bothers me a lot. I feel really gross about taking her virginity and pressuring to have sex with me. I always been vocal about how hot she is and how much I want to fuck but now I feel awful for making those remarks. I have sexual needs but now I feel like I am rushing and pressuring her. I hate the idea of me taking her virginity and now I want to break up. I really don’t want to be the asshole that fucked her and broke up with her.

I don’t know maybe it’s dumb but I hate the feeling of being with someone so naive and inexperienced. Makes me feel like I am corrupting them and pushing them. I really hate this feeling and makes me just want to end things."
"I need to escape but don’t want to hurt her.. I’ve been in a relationship for 11 year - married for not quite 6.  We’ve grown apart - almost zero physical contact.  I now realize her notion of Sex is completely different than mine (I think she was faking a bit while we were dating.  We generally spend time in different rooms...but I know she’d somehow be shocked and devastate if I told her I wanted to end it...no idea what to do.  I’m 60, she’s 55"
"Am I too sensitive or so he cross the line? Me(21F) and my bf (almost 20M) recently just made a year. I love him a lot and I care about him. He’s done some really nice things for me when we were first dating. I was unemployed for three months of our relationship. He got my car towed, took me out to eat, and was overall very charming and nice. But randomly overtime I’d learn stuff about him. His mother was an abusive drug addict and he grew up without a dad. He solely depends on his sister who is a narc. He’d tell me stuff from his past that was extremely traumatic but make it seem like it was no big deal and just something that happened. Lately things have gotten difficult for me because I know what problems I have I’m insecure and I take offense very easily. I’m not open fully with people and I’ve gotten a lot better. But he brings out the worst in me sometimes. I just sit back unspoken and watch him. His friends are basically all he has and he says they are his brothers but talks about them behind their back and act like they’re brothers up close. One time his “brother” was late doing something and my bf called him. He told my bf that his mom was a crckhead and no body loves him. This is how they talk to each other and always has for almost a decade. Its gotten to the point where I began pushing him away and avoiding him. A few days ago we were at one of his friends party at a hotel. We were all chilling and I was trying to feel them out and get to know them. I was joking with them when my bf said something and he looked at me and said “shut up before I knock some pounds on your little ass” the birthday girl started laughing and said “she’s like that chocolate lady from spongebob”. I felt bad because I didn’t do anything I watched him eat three bags of family size chips then insult my figure when he’s very overweight and pretends to want to get healthier. I ignored both of them and kept smoking but days later i still replay it in my mind. My boyfriend seems to only want to fix my problems so I’m not mentioning them anymore. I don’t want to give up on him I love him but this is hurting me."
"Should I [25F] reach out to my mom [56FtM] because I told him he can't move in with me after he withheld he had bed bugs? I am on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.


It's important to note that my mom has a small business where he rents out a kitchen to other small businesses while also (kind of) running his own business. 

 He has always been a very hard-to-talk-to individual and my sister [27F] and I are convinced he is mentally ill. There are a lot of stories I can get into but I will talk about the manipulation I feel was displayed. 

 For the first time ever, my mom has a therapist and has been learning not to call my sister and I under the guise of ""checking up on us"" only to have it turn into a line of questioning about us going with them to their next job, or to help them with catering or cleaning or some type of job or chore. These are the only calls we have received since being teens. 

 We don't talk so much now, but he called me a couple weeks ago and we actually had a decent conversation which did feel like he was learning to check in on us and that's it. The conversation turns into how the place he has been living (for free) had kicked him out because of the whole COVID situation and he was living in his office. It felt like he was just genuinely talking about it, and not trying to guilt me into offering him a place to stay. 

 I offered him a place to stay.

 I have a second bedroom that I don't use and so came yesterday (May 8th) when he was supposed to move in... He called me and the first thing he said was ""I didn't think this needed to be said but your sister thinks it's important you know that... *long horrible conversation blaming someone else and avoidong saying it*... [I have bedbugs]"" this was a 20 minute phone call and he told me at the end...


 I was quite mad and said ""I do want you to have a place to stay but I cannot risk the other people in this house or my own safety. He went on to say that he ""cleaned his office with alcohol"" and ""leaves his clothes in plastic bags"" and there's none in his office. First off, if they're in your office they are everywhere, second, he withheld extremely vital info that he could have address weeks ago (YEARS AGO as he knew this was an issue for about over a year). 

 So, I offered him to stay IF he can guarantee there are no bed bugs after fumigation and talking to the landlord and getting him to call the health unit/exterminator (who knows btw but doesn't think it's his problem) and mom was humming and hawing and saying ""I'll talk to him, don't worry about it I don't want to put you at risk but just so you know *goes on to explain that it's not his fault and that it won't transfer to my house*"" even though he will be going to and from that office. 

 So he refuses to deal with the issue and live at the office with bed bugs rather than have a hard conversation to get rid of the problem which WILL jeopardize his business. Cool.

 So a few hours go by and he calls back and the first thing he says is that he spoke with his therapist and was crying (I'm sorry I don't quite remember the conversation) and continuing old habits of guilt tripping like Eeyore. He then called my sister later and freaks out on her about me (nothing bad but just trying to have some validation to be enraged) and my sister shut her down.... It then came out that my sister had said ""either you tell her or I tell her"" as my sister found out the same day as well, and that's the ONLY reason my mom called me... Otherwise she would have just kept it secret. 


It's been a day and I know he slept at the office. I don't know what the hell to do because I do want him to have a safe place to stay but he won't talk to the Landlord or the Health Unit... I need advice on how to move forward in a relationship with him as I don't want to abandon him when he is TRYING to get better.


TL;DR - my mom told me the day he was moving in he had bedbugs at his office in which he was living- I refused to let him move in unless he fumigated and he refused to have that talk with his landlord. He is now spiraling with rage and sadness and has nowhere to live. How do I talk to him going forward?"
"Having trouble figuring out how often I[22F] should contact my boyfriend[22M]  we've been together for a year and a half now, and it has been... okay. I love him, but we definitely have had a few rough patches.  we get along well in person, but I'm having trouble with how much I get to see him/talk to him. We usually text a little bit everyday, which is 100% fine, but I do get a bit miffed if he ignored my messages for a day or two. 

Which I feel bad about, it's not fair to apply my standards for texting to somone who is more introverted than me.  However, it bothers me a lot more because he doesn't come over but once or twice a week(used to be every other day). Recently he will text me to hang out, then reply 4 hours later or fall asleep and leave me hanging.

That is frustrating, especially since he doesn't sleep over since he has a hard time sleeping next to somone. I'm cool with that, he can't help it, but it is not great since he comes over late and I only see him for a couple of hours max. Overall, the relationship is seemingly dying slowly. We haven't had sex in two months, and I won't pretend that my thoughts do not wander at times. 


Is this normal, am I just being dramatic? I ask because sometimes I need some help putting myself in check. What do you guys think? 
This is my first real relationship, so I don't have any clue really"
"My 22F boyfriend 21M of 5 years lied to me My boyfriend lied to me. I know sometimes men lie but here’s what it’s about. 
He enjoys talking to people and making new friends. He used the dating apps bumble and tinder to find women to talk to. Most of the time he would barely mention that he has a girlfriend and wouldn’t put it in his bio even after explaining that women will take it that he’s single. 

He met a woman(I’m trying to be civil but she’s really a whole lot of other things) she was living with her cheating now ex boyfriend and had a baby with him. Throughout them talking she would block my boyfriend and for a while I had no idea why and would go back to talking to him in and off. He swore nothing was going on with them even though I felt something was but I stayed to myself. 

I went to the ER Wednesday night and while I was there I got bored and logged into his Facebook messenger to see and read conversations (something we both do to each other) turned out he was talking to her while I was inside. I fought sight of a message saying, “sorry I let things get out of hand. I have bad luck with men and I’m trying to focus on myself and I’m ready to be friends.” He responded by saying “I’m sorry too, you’ll find someone for you there’s plenty of men out there.” To which she replied “I seriously think your my soulmate.” It got me thinking about what actually happened and what she meant. Meanwhile, he’s deleting the messages as I’m reading them. I get discharged from the ER shortly after that and get in the car because he had to drive me home and he could tell I was distraught, he asked what was wrong and I asked him what happened while telling him what I saw. He got quiet and his face went blank. 

He says she caught feelings (even after I told him she would because he was nice to her and she needed a “savior” for her and her child) and he had developed a strong caring for her. I screamed and yelled and cried and demanded he drove me home. I cried all night and demanded answers. He says nothing else happened other than her sending nudes and when she made advances he wouldn’t stop it. Until when he did she would block him. 

While I was working the next day, I messaged her and she made numbers claims about their relationship that weren’t true just to get into my head and when I told him about it he was so distraught that he almost made himself vomit. She is a sociopath who tries to ruin others lives when she doesn’t get what she wants and if you read when I read you’d see what I’m talking about. (I have screenshots of the conversation if you are interested in reading.) 

Reddit, sorry this was a long post but since Wednesday can’t help but feeling like there’s something else in the equation that I’m missing and can’t stop thinking about it. He seems very sincere and knows I don’t quite trust him but I just dint know what to do. HELP!"
"Me (28M) have a sensitive girlfriend (27F) Hi me and my girlfriend are together for almost 10 years now, we have never been with anyone else.

Actually we were supposed to marry but we postponed it due to covid-19.

In the last few years my girlfriend has a tendency to get hurt by me from things that to me seem random, and I just can't avoid it since I can't know what will cause it.

For example:

* She asked me to cut a salad and I said ok I will when we eat and I went to do some sport (in house), after a while she comes and tries to cut it herself I said ""wait let me do it"" she said ""no I already started"". Later that evening she was furious that I didn't bother to make her a salad when she worked hard all day (working from home) and for many hours, she didn't talk with me for 2 days until she calmed down. (I tried explaning her that I waited for her to come to the kitchen to start making the food, she didn't care)
* Friend came to our house and I gave him and my girlfriend a saucer to put their beer on so it won't stain the table, after a while she removed it and after a bigger while she said: ""it is not nice that only your friend has a saucer and we don't"", I said ""well I gave you one and you removed it I don't have power for you (native langauge sounds a bit different)"" I actually meant that I don't have power OVER her meaning I can't control her as this is her house too but my words came a bit differently, also in that evening she tried to use my phone only using her nose (I thought its funny) so I said ""eww she is touching my phone with her nose"" in a sarcastic funny way. Well guys at that night she was furious as hell, she actually went to her parents now to cooldown (first time she does it).
* Long time ago I told her in whatsapp something that my father said to me, and then she asked me what did he say? so I just copied and sent the same message again I thought she missed it somehow. She got very angry because I was ""too lazy"" to explain to her it and instead I just copypasted it even though she of course saw it.

These examples(except the last one) are just from the past week since I am having hard time to remember what I did since I consider it so small and harmless but she obviously takes these things very very hard.

I thought maybe I am not  sensitive enough with her but  she has a tendency to get offended by just about every living person

For example she got offended by my mother:

* My girlfriend cooked a very nice meal so I pictured it and sent to my family whatsapp group, my mother said ""That girl is just a champion!"", now my girlfriend got very offended by it because of the use of the word ""That"" in my native langauge it is more commonly used when you dislike someone but it really depends on the context, in english its like people normally saying ""Oh.. againt THAT guy"" but with the right context that word is actually good like my mom just tried to say a nice thing but my girlfriend took it as an attack.

She also get offended a lot at work, she actually replaced 3 work places in the last year since she didn't feel apperciated enough or she felt like people hate her there.

In the current work sometimes thing don't work as well for example:

* They had a sport day and she didn't want to go because she doesn't like sport that much, so she stayed home and worked(she told them she needs to work to finish stuff they need to finish ASAP), later her manager sent a whatsapp group message with an image of everyone(who was there) and said ""It was nice to see everyone today"", she got so offended that he said ""everyone"" but she wasn't there so how that could be ""everyone"" and why he didn't mention that she wasnt there? so she sent him an angry message saying how he doen't apperciate that she is busting her ass down while they are having fun.

I tried talking with her but she is too hurtful to talk, I said we need to work on her sensitivity and that normally people don't want to hurt her and she doesn't need to think that everyone is against her, instead try to think that people mostly are ok with you and no one actually wants to hurt her feelings.

I continued by saying that getting offended is a choice, a choice we make and we can make it so we won't get offended, she said that loving is also a choice and went to her parents (its the first time she goes in anger to her parents).

\---

\*\*TL;DR;\*\* :

My girlfriend is very sensitive and I don't know what to do, I feel terrible when she is angry all the time (and mostly when this anger goes on me)"
"My (21F) roommate (20F) told me I trigger her eating disorder, should I move out? For some background: My roommate ( Ill call her Trixie) and I have been living together for almost 2 years now. We were both new to the city and had just started uni together, and when our lease was up, we moved to a new place with a friend of hers, ""Josie"". In our first year, Trixie used to hang out all the time, and felt just a weird connection, where we would think really alike, and just had very similar childhoods and experiences, so we would talk about everything and anything. This was also around the time, where we both developed, what felt like an eating disorder. I never saw this connection we shared as an issue, as I really saw my struggles independently from her, I just had really low self-esteem and would starve myself (which I still do, but im trying to improve!), and I would notice her eating less and less, but when I called her out on it, she would kind of brush it off.

So fast forward to a couple months later, we move in with Josie and everything seems fine, Josie and I get along for the most part, but I can kind of feel, that they are just besties, Trixie seems just much more relaxed and fun with her, and I can't help but feel a little jealous and isolated... We barely hung out anymore, I spent most of the time just alone in my room, and I felt like Trixie was avoiding me. We talked about it, I voiced my concerns with both of them, and they were very apologetic and understanding, so things got a little better, but Trixies behavior didnt really change...

Now since all of this corona-bs, I had been spending a little more time with Josie, as Trixie left to stay with her parents and she didnt come back for almost 6 weeks. (In Germany, this is not very normal, so we were kind of concerned at some point.)When she came back, Trixie and I had a talk, where she basically told me that because I had lost so much weight (I was at 97 pounds at that point) she felt triggered by me, and how she found our similarities kind of creepy, and that that was the reason, why she left. Because she felt like our friendship was ""weird"".

Now: I dont really know what to do, I feel like we're back at square one, as Im typing this, they're going to hang out outside, but havent even bothered to ask if I want to come with them... I feel really alone, especially now, that I cant meet my other friends. Im also really hurt by what she said, because when she saw me lose so much weight, she didnt even think to tell me she was worried, and I had spent months really crying about everything, because I felt so alone, and like she didnt like me anymore... And she said that she would really purposefully avoid me, so Im not so sure what to do now. On one hand I wanna move out, on the other hand I really like living here, and I love my roommates very much, it just seems like theres no room here for me anymore.

I just feel really alone.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: After our talk, shes just pretending that everything is normal, and talks to me more, yes. But I cant really forget what she told me, and Im really hurt by all of this."
"Lomh distance relationahip Does long distance relationships work? I met her at a social media shes russian and im an asian, weve talk  for months now shared our thoughts together,laughed .

"I (23F) and still being traumatized by my abusive relationship with my ex (36M)   

I had been in an abusive relationship with a real weird (I'm a stupid idiot who didn't see the red flags and ignored the age difference), and although we broke up in Jan this year, I still feel very affected. Of course, toxic people never give closure, but still I’m dying to know what exactly happened. I posted my entire experience a while back on Reddit, and here’s the link.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/errsvc/my\_boyfriend\_36m\_broke\_up\_with\_me\_23f\_because\_he/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/errsvc/my_boyfriend_36m_broke_up_with_me_23f_because_he/)

It’s quite a shocker, I agree. My ex is a textbook narcissist. I’ve heard about “projection” and I’ve learnt that many people have been in relationships where their partner accuses them of cheating, when in reality the partner himself/herself is the cheater. And this brings me to a very disturbing conclusion: I think there’s some sort of sexual abuse happening at my ex’s place. I sometimes feel he’s incestuous with his own sister. I started speaking to a therapist online about the whole incident, and she felt that there’s a possibility this might be true. And now I feel highly disturbed and repulsed. Here are few reasons as to why I suspect there’s something afoot (maybe not necessarily incest, but something sinister going on at his place):

He was sexually assaulted when he was 5. All he said was, the perpetrator was an old man. I don’t know if it was a relative or not. 

He had an uncanny obsession with incest. Even when we were friends, and we’d chat about Netflix and TV shows, he’d always say that he never watched GoT because it had lots of incest in it. He’d say things like twins ALWAYS have sex, he’d never date a girl with a brother, if girls develop breasts very early in adolescence, it’s because their brothers are sucking them. He would keep saying that he always maintains a distance with his own sister. That he only ever hugged her once in his life. 

His sister stays in her parental house (where my ex stays too), claiming that her husband’s apartment had some contract that states that women aren’t allowed to stay in the building. Pretty sure this is nonsense. What housing society wouldn’t allow a legally married couple to stay together???? 

When my parents wanted to meet him for the first time, he brought his sister along. I felt a bit unnerved because, which 36 year old man brings his younger sister along to meet his prospective in laws? From then onwards, he kept involving his sister in our relationship. And I could see that she didn’t like me. She kept telling me that the relationship won’t work out. My ex would reveal all my insecurities to his sister. Things got worse. She started telling me that my parents are cheap, that her family is classy and can never accept me as their daughter in law, that I should just break up and forget about it. I found a lot of inconsistencies in their lies. She kept telling me that I should break up because she doesn’t like my parents. Whereas my ex told me that he wanted to break up because he’s convinced I’m cheating on him with my dad. His sister also tried to label me as a loose character because my ex told her that I had crushes when I was a teenager. 

After our breakup, I told my parents about his accusation. Mom and I stormed over to their place, and we found out that his own dad never knew that he intended to marry me. On top of it, his sister told his dad that I’m a crazy girl who’s madly in love with her brother. My mom lost her temper and told my ex’s sister that she’s the one who’s probably sleeping with her brother and her own dad. Now here’s the weird part: while my mom made a scene out there, their dad was unresponsive. He didn’t even rise from his chair when we entered. Didn’t react at all when we accused his own daughter of having sex with him. Didn’t say a word except that he knew nothing about me.

This person really broke my heart and tried to destroy me, and it’s been really hard for me to start leading a normal life again. I gave him my everything (and yes, I ignored all the red flags like a stupid idiot) and he turned out to be a monster. 

I’m dying to know what could have really happened. Anyone with experience able to shed some light on this?"
"Gift giving “expectations” I (27F) bought my fiancé (28M) a new phone for his birthday. His current one is shattered and slow. He has been talking about buying a new for a long time but saying he doesn’t have the money. 
When I gave him the gift he had no face of excitement. He seemed upset I spent my money on the gift. He implied we should return it to find it cheaper somewhere else. I felt like I failed. He did finally thank me. 
I had to preorder the phone but it finally was mailed about 5 days ago. He hasn’t set it up. He was going to yesterday but the data transfer meant being off of his phone for a few hours and he didn’t want to do that, which seemed ridiculous. Then the transfer overnight didn’t work and he still showed no interest in setting up the phone. He just wanted to sit and scroll through his old phone. 

I told him it made me feel unappreciated and that he didn’t like the gift. He told me he isn’t excited about it since I have expectations of him to set it up quickly and that when you give someone a gift they should be able to do what he wants with it. 

Am I in the wrong for wanting him to setup the phone and use it? Or am I nagging and should just let it go?"
"My fiance (26/f) and I (27/m) are having communication issues. Need help. So my fiance told me about how she's recently been reliving a traumatic experience from her past in the shape of nightmares. I told her how it was horrible and talked to her, trying to console her when she was crying and we went to sleep. Next morning, she was upset and I asked her if she had the same night and she said yes. Then we started talking about something else and changed the conversation, after a while I could sense that there was sadness in her tone and like always, I asked her hey what's wrong (by which I meant is there anything else that's wrong apart from the nightmare thing - she has a lot of issues in her life rn). She snapped and told me she doesn't want to talk to me about this anymore because I'm not giving her the reaction she's expecting, and that I'm not being empathetic and making the situation about myself. I asked her as to why she thought this way and she said I'm not giving her what she wants and I shouldn't have asked again after our conversation last night. It went from just a casual conversation to a heated one. Then she ended the conversation by saying that I know that it's difficult for you to understand these things so i would rather deal with it on my own.

Can you guys please help me understand how what I said came across as not having empathy? I'm so confused and she refuses to clarify other than saying it's not the reaction that she needed at that moment."
"My fiance keeps bringing up being in an open relationship while drunk and its bugging me This is a throw away account BTW 

So my fiance (23m) and I (21f) have been together for almost two years. We have tried an open relationship twice both have failed for one reason or another and both times I was uncomfortable. Well the past few nights he's been drinking and bringing it up , like he finds it stupid people don't do it like they use to , why are people so scared, etc. Well I told him my reasons and he said I shouldn't fear it , because he'd never cheat on me or leave me for anyone else . But that fear says otherwise . Now I'm starting to feel like I'm not good enough , like I don't please him anymore. I love him , I really do but I don't feel like I'm enough anymore. I'm lost as what to do , because I have flat out told him I really don't want another open relationship, but he brings it up only when he's drunk , and doesn't remember what he says the next morning. He's not mean or abusive , and he's told me when he's sober that it doesn't bother him...but I really don't know how to feel, I'm lost because I know he loves me but I just hate this feeling...
Like he's the only one who has made me feel like I'm so much more then what I really am , so why can't I brush this off ?"
"Can't see your Significant Other because of the virus? No worries, my dad thinks sleeping around instead is perfectly justified. I (29F) had a phone conversation with my dad (53M) the other day and he casually asked whether I have seen my boyfriend. I live in the UK, still under lock down and am immonocompromised. It is insane that I feel I need to justify this decision but since my bf has been going into work, being one of the managers in the HQ of a big bank, we haven't visited each other since the whole thing started. It has not been easy for either of us, I even cracked emotionally a few times and thankfully he was the reasonable one who managed to pull me out of the mini darknesses. The fear of not knowing what the future looks like and when it would be safe to be together is hurting me on a level I don't admit to others.

So back to the conversation with dad. His response to my 'no, not yet, we are still keeping me safe' was: 'what the f*ck are you on about?! Hahahaha he must have cheated on you like 10 times till now'. To which I 'maturely' just hung up.

On a normal day maybe this statement wouldn't have hurt me this much but it just sucks that on the surface the choice seems to be: risk my life or have sex. I do trust my boyfriend completely and I love him very much. But the thing is if either of us were to cheat, then honestly the other one is better off without this person. 

Now, my reaction goes back a bit... Mom and dad divorced when I was 10. Last year of high school I lived on my own. Mom went to work abroad to put me through uni. I got my first and relatively serious boyfriend in that final year. After graduation I went to visit my mom for 3 weeks. I then came back to basically see my then boyfriend with another girl. When my dad hears the story, he goes: 'What did you expect when you left for three weeks?!'. Well, considering he was the one to say 'I love you' for the first time while I was away, definitely not that?! Anyway, I haven't felt guilty for his cheating but it sure did leave some sort of imprint on my self-esteem and my role in a relationship that I hadn't identified until I heard this reasoning again...

And what is more, when I was a child my mom used to tell me that my dad had a mistress but I never believed it because when I was a child, he was my hero, he was my role model, how would I ever believe he could have cheated on her and left me for hours to spend time with another woman and her daughter?! I now remember my mom saying all sorts of other stuff I dismissed because of how much I needed them not to be true, but now I feel like the Pandora box has been opened... 

Where I struggle is I always tend to get an understanding of why people have certain beliefs or act the way they do. Not to excuse them, but to get a better closure / outcome for my own wellbeing and it has helped me a lot in the past.

However, in this case I am lost, I don't know how else to frame 'my dad had a scratch and treated my mom like shit' and he feels no remorse over it. He feels it was justified. And sadly on a deeper level when later I was raped and he dismissed it with 'what did you expect when you go out clubbing?', there is all this rage towards that entire outlook. That any horrificly wrong is simply justified just like that.

I know I don't have to have the same value system as him and I have come such a long way without his support whatsoever but I don't want to brush off shitty statements as if they don't affect me or I don't find them disturbing. Right now I feel like I don't want to be close to someone who doesn't value loyalty or family integrity. 

So I guess what my question is can anyone see a different angle from which I can look at this? Or something good I can take from this for my own benefit? I want to have a conversation with him but I honestly don't know what my desired outcome would be or how to conduct it in an efficient way and not lose my temper. Thank you!"
"ThrowRA Getting very mixed signals and have no clue what to do So I (16M located in US) met a girl (17f located in UK) on reddit about a month ago and we have been talking on snapchat everyday,and early on I noticed her putting alot of hearts in her messages and then she eventually started saying that she loves me,so I brought it up with her and asked if she just liked me just as a friend or as more,she answered back with just as friends and that she talks to all her friends like that,so yeah I was a little disappointed but was getting over it,well now she's saying things like ""you're very attractive/handsome"" and that ""anybody would be lucky to date you"" and she's always telling me that I'm really amazing and fabulous and that I always brighten her day and make her smile, we also talk quite alot about meeting up in real life someday and she tells me about all these places she'd love to take me,so then I tell her about places where I'd like to take her and I mentioned that one of them is the perfect spot for a date and she expressed interest in going there with me,she also seems like she'd be physically comfortable with me seeing as she has told me that when we meet she wants to give me a big hug,and I was talking about something I do with people where I'll rest my arm/elbow on top of people's heads (I'm pretty tall and she's on the shorter side) and she's like ""oh,you'll have to do that to me when we meet in real life"",and we also talk a fair amount,I wake up earlier to talk with her(I told her about it and she thinks it's really sweet) and she stays up later so we can talk for longer and sometimes on weekends she'll take breaks from social media because she struggles with some mental health issues,but even when she takes the breaks she still talks with me for a little bit and makes it clear that I'm the only one she's talking to that day,but on the other hand she is really slow at responses,usually it takes her between 10 minutes and about 2 hours to reply,except for when it gets later for her,then she responds back very fast,she also is comfortable sharing pretty personal things with me that she doesn't really tell anyone else, oh,and I should probably mention that she's a pretty shy person 

So all in all I'm very confused and would like to know what everyone thinks of my situation and how I should approach it,do you think she's just being friendly or is she interested in me?"
"Me (22M) and all of you (17+ M)  Hey everyone, trying to understand more about issues facing men regarding relationships and dating!

For myself, mutual understanding and courage, and the perfect situation? hmm there's so many haha but key is a woman who I don't have to pretend anything with

Thanks to all :) looking forward to learning about you"
"How do I stop having sexual feelings for my dad? I know this is pathetic and horrible to feel so but it’s unfortunately true. I have not seen my father since I was 2 years old and my mom moved places since then.

I tracked him down and found out he is doing well and is quite well to do and extremely handsome of course. I met him once or twice to gather some info and hear his side of the story. 

In short, mom was right! He was at fault for the separation. Very honestly speaking I didn’t really plan to have a relationship with him. The original plan was to get information and move on. I don’t have an ounce of fatherly feelings for him and it’s not my fault for that. 

The problem was he was so tempting and enchanting that I agreed to a full fledged relationship unintentionally. He wants regular dad meet up like meet once a month, call once a week etc and vacation with his family once a year. I said yes without paying attention and he is elated. Nonetheless I thought if I spend some time with him maybe the sexual feelings will go away. Except it never went away and it became worse. 

When I was sick during the day we were supposed to meet, he brought soup over and we watched a Netflix movie. We did Netflix and chill without the sex basically. He was cool with letting me cuddle him for some reason ( because daughters don’t really touch/hug their dads in our culture)

Does he also feel the same way ? He is single anyways

Is there a way for these feelings to go away while continuing the relationship he wants ? 

Is there a way to “break up” with him giving a good explanation?"
"My (26M) girlfriend (26F) of two years broke up, won't commit to it being forever, should I have hope? It's been a week since the breakup -

We have a 1 year old son together and lived together for nearly two years.

We dated for a very short time before I moved in with her and we got our own place, she got pregnant the day I moved in we're sure, and so these are all things I attribute to the dissolution of our relationship.

It became a dull chore, we were in a rut, and we both feel relief now that we're apart, but at the same time I absolutely adore her, I'm distraught at losing her and our family, and I just really, really more than anything want to work on myself and am taking steps to show her that I'm going to be better. The problems we have are a negative cycle, I stop contributing, chores, she feels unappreciated, I'm too consumed by my bad mental state to pay attention to what matters, she's tried to help me and doesn't nag but finds it hard to communicate her emotions and lies to herself about it, every 3 months things get better then slip back and she doesn't have faith it will change.

She never said ""we're never getting back together"" but she communicated that she needs the space, it's important to treat it like a permanent break up, that I'm not the person she wants me to be right now, she has hope for the future but doesn't know how she'll feel, she originally gave a timeline of a year, a year break, and as we talked more she said ""I won't want to date for at least 6 months, and who knows, maybe we'll be dating then, I don't know.""

We separated like this in December also, but we were much closer then, she wanted to miss me, she knew things were bad but that was a break, not a breakup, and this really is a breakup, we're having distance and only really talking when it's about our boy, although we do talk about other things sometimes, but it's only been a week so I don't know what will happen.

I've even made a giant document detailing all the things I need to work on, Maslow's hierarchy, health, mental and physical, medication, employment, I told her that I'm going to get a job here, and do all of this for myself, and I guess I'm hoping that she'll see me change and see how much effort I'm putting in and will want us to be a family again, and she has hope for that.

Also important to mention that yesterday she wanted to be completely honest and say she felt a lot of relief when I left and felt guilty about it, and hasn't been upset or cried over it, I told her we were living together for a month after the breakup and she mourned then, that it's been stretched out, she took it on board and agreed.

What do you think? Will we just drift apart, never to reconnect, what are the signs? What can I do, give her MORE space, or push for more visits and more contact?

Thanks for reading!"
"unintended roommate during quarantine. How to navigate this? I feel like a grade “A” asshole. My BF’s friend is staying with us during quarantine. It’s been two months and lately it’s been getting to me.

He’s not a bad person. Not particularly messy, but also not crazy helpful.

Prior to this, I had only hung out with his friend like 2-3 times.  

I’ve been venting to my boyfriend about the little things and now he’s gone and asked his friend what his long term plans are.

I feel absolutely awful he said anything, but also grateful, especially since his buddy had no plans to leave (which is understandable cause we’re in fucking quarantine.) 

I’m just so all over the place with my feelings and not sure how to handle it. I always welcome people over and want them to feel comfortable and relaxed. 

I also think quarantine is getting to me and I’m fixating on his friend. 

Additional context, buddy lost someone at the beginning of the year. 

I’m just feeling so sad and awful and not sure how to handle it. What can I do to maintain my feelings of solitude and privacy, especially with my BF, while having his friend stay?"
"Is there any changes to get her back? I've been ignored for kinda long time. I don't know the exact reason why are she doing this to me. She said that she just wanna be alone. Usually i chat her everyday (but only getting read, or short reply), sometimes i don't chat her at all. It's been 2 months total, and i think it's just way too long for having ""me-time."" And i think i'm the only one who getting ignored by her. Is there any changes she will back to me? I can't moving on untill now since she's just perfect for me. 


Btw she doesn't say anything (like example she doesn't love me anymore, etc). The only things she said is only she just wanna be alone"
"I Was The Other Guy In An Affair (Kind Of) This is a really weird one and im not even sure about the title tbh. So lets say i know a girl from uni in the uk. I dont really know her but i know who she is. I finish uni last August. She lives in NYC and i live in England. She enters a relationship with a guy in October, but between then and now she has met him once, at new year. Hes 24, shes 18 and im 21. They've met once but they are bf and gf (which is fine). I start talking to the girl at the start of february. As time goes on we talk (dm) more and more to the point that its all day everyday. We send funny videos to each other and i made her a burthday card and stuff. We talk about anything and everything. Like whatever we're just friends. 

She tells me shes single in march and just before quarantine (i think like march the 25th or sometime around then) i ask her out. Im trying my luck, and she says yes to my suprise. The days go by and we talk more and more to the point its continuous. Even at work im replying on my smartwatch and stuff. She send nudes, i send nudes and then we start calling and playing games together. Our calls were sometimes like 4 hours long. The first time i was like oh she really likes me is when she called me her SO like 2 weeks in (bear in mind we talked constantly and it was quarantine. This time felt like months). So then we end up saying i love you to each other and promising and saying all these things you would to the person you love. I was planning on flying over straight after quarantine and spending 3 weeks there (which is longer than the amount of time her bf has spent with her). Like i was in love, she gave me butterflies and everything, i adored everything about her because i thought we were in love (loool im a clown). 

Last saturday it was her birthday, i wake up at 4:45am to say hb to her at 5am (midbight for her) and i did and she opened the card i sent her which is sooo cringe to read now i wanna die lol. I go to work at 6am and come back at 2pm, she says she wants birthday fun later. We call from about 3 to 5 and she goes for a nap. 9pm her fucking bf messages me on ig and turns my world upside down. I had no idea he existed. We talk (dm) for a bit and i throw up several times. And i wait for her to wake up. Which was like 2am my time. She had said yes to me asking her out because she was afraid id stop talking to her and she thought shed see how it went. But her real bf wasnt giving her attention ever. But i was. She developed feelings for me but felt bad (because she had a bf). He told me she was getting back at him for something she told me he never talks to her and likes lewd pictures of other women and tells her shes not his type amongst other things. Obviously idk whats true. He also told me some bad stuff about her which wasnt true like she did porn when she was 14. He was also mad so i guess he said the worst stuff possible. That night i blocked her. But the next day i unblocked her because quite frankly i wasnt satisfied with the answers i had gotten. Like she said sooo much stuff you'd only say to someone you truly love, unless you're actually very mentally disturbed.

She loves her bf so they got back together, ie he forgave her. And that following day for some dumb reason i forgave her and tried to be friends again, because tbh i liked it when we were friends just fine (i just liked her enough that id give dating her a go, kinda thing.) He didn't want us to be friends understandably and that night we left it at shes there for me when i really need someone, which i was like fuck that, kinda thing.

The next day she messages me and asks me how work was and tells me they are just friends now because he said some bad stuff about her to me and he hasnt treated her very well by the sounds of it. Im kinda like wtf but okai.

Basically i hate what she did to me. But i dont hate her. I kinda still love her which sucks for me. If her reasons for talking to me and liking me and stuff are genuine ie he didnt give her attention and wasnt a great bf then is what she did really that bad? Like how can you be bf and gf and have only seen each other once in 8 months? He only lives in another state. I literally planned my time to spend 3 weeks with her after quarantine (assuming that was within the next month or so.) And then go see her again for a month at the end of summer.

Is her lying about having a bf unforgivable? And at the moment we are both friendzoned. Is there any way i can win her back (even though i technically didnt have her)? I literally gave her all the love and affection you can (over the internet lol) i thought i did everything i could. But maybe i didnt. I know she wasnt talking to him and things because she literally had no time she was talking to me all the time. Idk it seems weird that for like half the time they've been together I've been her bf and not him.

This is honestly sooo fucking dumb but ive fallen for her hard like very fuckin hard. I feel like i need to get her somehow or i just wanna ktfo for the next 2 weeks coz i dont wanna think about it or remember anythin"
"What do to about my boyfriends crazy ex? 

So I run my boyfriends instagram for him. -he’s an athlete-  but he ex keeps trying to end us and she won’t just let it go. I want her to follow him so she can see that he’s happy and will leave us alone, but I don’t want to follow her and make it seem like he’s still interested in her even though it’s me. Also, I can’t say anything to her, because she can ruin his career -and yes she’s the kind of person that would do that- so how do I get her to leave us alone -by the way we see her everywhere- she’s called me names has told me to leave him alone and pretty much for me to back off even though he hates her guts. He wishes he could tell her off but his career would be on the line. Everytime I see her I’m scared a fist fight between us is goin to breakout even though I try to ignore her. What can I do to make her shut up and gain the upper hand?"
"My (22M) girlfriend's (22F) male friend (26M) has been living with for over a month, and I think he is after her and I want him out. Girlfriend wants him to stay because he'll be homeless if we kick him out. My gf had a childhood friend (I'll call Julia) that died some months ago in a tragic way. Since then she's been mourning and I've been helping her through it, I moved in with her to help her cover rent (my gf lived with her before she died) and things have been going better. 

There's this guy ""Erik"" who was close friends with Julia and we had met him a few times before at some parties. My gf and Erik have been bonding a lot since the death. I didn't know Julia that well, so I get she wants someone she can talk to about memories and share the loss with. Erik starts showing up at apartment a lot and we all hangout in the start. The thing is Julia used to run in this sort of 'gang' years ago which composed of drug dealers and some low-scale crime. Erik was one of them, he's got criminal record, kind of a career dealer, has had enough run-ins with the law that he can't rent his own place &amp; he's struggling landing a ""real job"" so he deals small-scale deals to get by, he worked some construction gigs but now because of the situation he hasn't been making much money at all. After some time Erik asks me and my  gf if he could move into our spare room because he's being kicked out of his temporary housing because he doesn't have money, he says he just wants to stay for a month or 2, until he gets back on his feet. He can't pay rent but he promises us free weed when we want (we both smoke sometimes to relax, I'm a university student and she's working part-time atm) and that he'll be no trouble for us. I'm skeptical about this arrangement from the start, but my gf says it means a lot to her to help Erik because he was close to her deceased friend, and it'd be what she thinks Julia would have wanted, so I agree as long as it's temporary. Now over two months has passed and I regret it. Erik is sneaky. When we're hanging out in the living room and all having a conversation Erik often ignores me while talking only to my gf and maintaining eye-contact with her. We live in a Eastern-European country and he and my girlfriend speak a mutual language that I understand but don't speak, and he'll often switch to it during mid-conversation, and say ""hey it's ok because you understand anyway"". He keeps opening up to my girlfriend about his 'adventurous crime life"" and it feels like he's doing it to try to impress her. I feel like he's after her, and she's either naive about it because she feels a bond with him, or she likes the attention. Then one night my gf was gone visiting her parents and he shows up with some beers and hands me one. We start talking, and he gets drunk and then goes on telling stories about the guys he's beaten because they jumped him, about his plans to rob an ATM etc. the kind of stuff that doesn't impress me at all and if he wasn't a friend of my gf, I'd be tempted to call the cops. I get a feeling he's just kind of bragging anyway. I decide to stay quiet, so he asks me what I'm thinking of, so I just say ""Well that sounds like a lot of big talk to me"". Then he gets all serious after the comment and says ""Oh yeah, you want to hear some big talk? I watched a man die once, he squirmed around like a fish until he took his last breath. You take a moment to think about that."" with a grin on his face. I don't know why, but this comes across like a vague threat if I'm honest, so I just keep quiet again. He then laughs and says ""I'm messing with you, don't worry"".

Final straw was yesterday when I see him and my gf sitting on my bed together, and he's shirtless and she's giving him a back rub. She notices me walking in &amp; says ""He has a bit of a back ache"" and well, I get pissed off and storm out for a walk. Later I confront my gf telling her that I don't trust Erik. I think he is bad news for us. She says that he needs our help and he's going through some rough stuff, and if we kick him out he'll be homeless and won't get his life together and it's not safe for him out there. She says I'm reading too much into the ""stories"" he's told, and that  I'm just being jealous thinking something will happen between them. She tells me I need to calm down about it and give him at least a month to figure out his stuff and wait for the situation out there to imrpove. I tell her I want him gone, and she says I'm inconsiderate and privileged.

My line of thinking is that he has crossed too many boundaries, and that he is using my girlfriend's niceness and disrespecting me in my own home, and I'm pretty sure he'll be able to stay at some friend's place for a while if we get rid of him because prior to moving to ours he was always hanging at some friend's anyway. I also worry that he's past behavior and recklessness will catch up with us at some point. 

I want to get rid of him, and I'm thinking I'd just go up to him behind my girlfriend's back and tell him I want him gone, but I don't know if I'm overreacting (my girlfriend said I was) and if that would be a dick move of me?"
"Questions i cant answer hey all, i recently just got out of my first ever relationship it was nothing major tbh it lasted a few months and was only online, i know to a lot of people that means nothing but for me it was special she was the first person to ever show care or love and acceptance for me.

Our time together was good and bad we had great days and bad days, we would spend all out time together literally 24/7 she would complain a lot at little things and would cause arguments over little things, she was extremely jealous to the point i was unable to talk to friends including one she introduced me too, i wanted to try things such as streaming but she was 100% against it.

During my time with her there were moments were i thought it would be best if we were just friends i wanted her to be happy and looked after and i wanted to do it but it was hard, recently she left me over an argument she got with someone new the same day (something she had done twice before) i was hurt but wanted to remain friends as i cared and still do about her.

This was not possible she know hates me and it hurts more, I do truly want her to be happy but i miss her i miss that person being there in my life. i am changing for the better and for myself which is really the only thing to come out of this whole thing.

My Problem is i'm glad she is happy, but she seems completely different, her Partner is a streamer, he has multiple friends he speaks to and a variety of other things, the thing she complained at me for and got annoyed at me for he does freely and it makes me sit and think maybe it was my fault maybe if i could have brought that out while i was with her we would have worked, i just don't know how to move on and answer these things.

At first i wanted them to fail but now all i want is her happiness and if that is without me i understand but its really hard for me to let go off these thoughts so any help would be nice or any advice"
"I'm worried for him I already talked about him here but the situation is changing.
We are just friends but he writes to me very sweet messages in which he thinks about us as a couple and I really like him.

My[17F] best friend [17M] is drinking a lot recently.
Yesterday he send me a foto of a box full of bottles of vodka and vine saying that he's going to get wasted today.
I never drunk alcol, I don't like it.
I replied whit ""be carefully"" and he said he wasn't expecting that.
He though I would have said something like ""don't do it"" but I've said it so many times and I was just tired of hearing him saying that I don't have to worry about him.
I replied whit ""do you expected that or do you want to hear me say that?"" He responded ""both"" and said that I have the power to make him think before doing something stupid (he even quite smoking for me).
I said ""I don't want you to hurt yourself, I don't want you to be in danger but you are going to do it anyway, aren't you?""
He said yes but now he though about it and said that he never know I was such a protective person.
The guys he's going to party whit are not trustworthy and I can't go whit him.

I'm probably being a child and probably this is not a big deal for most people but it is for me.
He knows that even if I don't show it I worry a lot for him especially in those situation.
I don't understand what's happening it looks like he's trying everything to get my attention but he never cared about it.
I'm so confused and worried I don't know what to do"
"Is she interested in me? So I came out of a 4 year relationship (my first one) a few months ago, and have been talking to someone I think I'm quite romantically interested in recently. We met outside the university library a while back at like 1am. She asked me for a cigarette and we proceeded to talk til like 3 in the morning, and she asked me to email her the essay I was working on because she said it seemed interesting, so we ended up exchanging numbers. We ended up running into each other very late at the library and talking for ages over the next couple weeks, but at the time, it was entirely platonic (I think, I was still in a relationship so I suppose I just didn't think of the whole situation in that way). We ended up texting a bit a couple months ago, after I asked if she was on campus/at the library, and she said she'd graduated, so we arranged to get coffee instead. She had to cancel because of family stuff, and then lockdown happened, but we kept texting a little. A week ago, we hadn't texted for a couple weeks, but she messaged me asking if I'd like to go on a hike/coastal walk with her, and I said I'd love to, so we arranged to go on a dayhike near her place. We went for the hike yesterday, and I was unsure as to whether she was interested in me romantically or not, but I genuinely find her interesting and fun to be around, and would love to be platonic friends, so I didn't really think about the whole thing in one way or the other, and thought I'd just see how it goes etc. I did remember in the past that she smiled a lot when we spoke, but didn't read much into that and assumed she was just super friendly etc. and I thought a coastal walk might have certain implications, but even in a normal scenario, could be entirely platonic, but considering the pandemic lockdown situation, it wasn't as if she'd asked to go on a coastal walk as opposed to just a coffee catch-up, so I assumed there's a large chance it's just like, the only way to hang out that's safe these days anyway. 

We ended up greeting by hugging (I know I know, social distancing is important etc, but we're only getting like 2-10 new cases a day now where I live, and we'd both been staying at home), and she took me to a spot she used to go to and read/journal when she was younger, on a cliffside overlooking the ocean. We spoke for a few hours about our lives and how we're doing, as well as rather poignant social issues etc., again, she smiled and laughed a lot, and she mentioned being cold so I gave her my jumper, and she said it smelt nice and asked me what cologne I used. We walked back to the station, and she said it was nice to see me, and I told her the same thing, and she offered to give me a lift closer to town where trains are more regular. She was initially going to drop me off at the next station, but when we got there she said she could drop me further and we spoke in the car a bunch, and made plans to do something similar next week. 

I think she's super fun to be around, she's super smart, and I deeply respect how driven she is etc. And definitely think she's super cute. 

Does any of this suggest she might be potentially interested in me romantically? I would love to be friends with her either way, so I don't want to ask her too early, as I'd prefer our friendship to be strong enough by the time that I ask, so that if she says no, it wouldn't be a big deal &amp; we could continue being friends. At the same time, if she is interested in me, there's the potential that she might be waiting for me to say something, considering that she was the one who asked to hang out, so maybe the onus is on me to take the next step? I am also aware that like, currently she feels relatively comfortable around me, which is why were able to have fun and talk about whatever, and I know that as a man, if I told her I was interested in her romantically, and she didn't feel the same way, it might make her feel uncomfortable &amp; the last thing I would want is to put her in the position where she feels like I don't value her company ipso facto/make her like I wouldn't have been as interested in what she has to say if I wasn't interested in her romantically. 

I'm basically super inexperienced, as I've only been in one relationship, which started in highschool, and we were best friends for like 3 years beforehand, so there were many factors that made the whole situation much easier in terms of beginning our relationship. I've never even kissed anyone else or consciously flirted with anyone, and I've always preferred the idea of becoming involved with someone I already know &amp; who's company I already know I enjoy, so I'm totally naïve when it comes to any of this. 

Any thoughts and musings are welcome, of course! I suppose I'm wondering what people think in general, and advice on how to proceed

Edit: in case anyone's wondering, I'm 21 and she's a year or 2 older I think"
"I need help to know if this is my fault, I’m sinking more and more into a dark hole each day I’m going to try make this as short and precise as I can, black and white including the issues on both sides. 

Me and my bf both want more sex, and more exciting sex. I don’t initiate it enough, but as of late my bf doesn’t either. Bf has a porn addiction (although he has come very very far with it, a significant improvement). But this addiction left me crushed and with 0 self-esteem - hence not initiating it. I have also gained a little weight as I’m constantly stressed and struggle to find time for myself. Bf also has severe anxiety and depression which would impact this as he also has self-esteem issues. He started antidepressants and therapy about 2 weeks ago. I want more adventurous sex, around the house, different times of the day, PASSIONATE. He spends ALL of his waking hours playing computer games so there’s no romance or build up when he wants to have sex late at night when I’m in bed trying to sleep for work the next morning. Then when we do have sex I never get off, which isn’t so much an issue for me but just as it is feeling really good, he isn’t able to hold out and finishes (any ideas why this can happen because I’m genuinely curious. He just says it’s because it feels too good 🤷🏻‍♀️). He bought some toys, and most of them are great ideas but he gets discouraged when I don’t enjoy them at first because well practice makes perfect. With the stress of everyday life I often don’t have a lot of time to just sit still after work (come home and grocery shop, cook, clean, washing, study, shower and bed). So I know that’s on me for maybe being lazy and not initiating it more?. He has also confessed previously he wasn’t sexually attracted to me because the sex is boring but I also believe that came from his porn addiction. He will actually still compliment me sometimes but it feels like a backhanded compliment (other people with SO that are PA would understand) which almost depleted my self-esteem more? Why compliment me if you’re supposedly ‘not sexually attracted’ to me? I still find him very attractive! There just isn’t any passion anymore due to not spending enough time together and the fact I’m constantly run off my feet (I’m exhausted most days, I do all the cooking &amp;amp; cleaning the past few months as he is too mentally exhausted to do anything). I can’t help but think I am the one not doing enough. I have suggested more quality time together, not leaving it till I’m falling asleep to come onto me and to slowly implement the toys but I feel like I’m stuck in mud. 

We’re in a rut, want the same things but don’t know where to start, any suggestions please??!! My heart is breaking into a million pieces."
"Relationships, friend groups and fall outs Heeelllppp!

BACKGROUND STORY SUMMARY:
My current bf and I were in the same friend group when we got together and we were all very close like family. One of our best friends (m) got a gf who really tore the group apart a year back. He was blind to the type of person she is though and allowed it to happen. Me, being the only female in the friend group, got targeted by his gf the most though. She always wanted to be there when we hung out, didnt allow him to hang out with me alone, and was quite nasty to me in a sneaky mean girl type of way. This hurt like hell since me and him were really close, went on trips together, etc. (close friends, nothing more). The friendship became toxic (a lot of shit went down) and I've removed them out of my life. My boyfriend however is still friends with him. This external conflict is now causing internal conflict for my relationship. 

How do I deal with this?? I would never tell him to not hangout with this guy who is my ex best friend. But I've been hurt so bad by him that I have a lot of anger towards it all. I want to be able to vent to my bf about it, but since they are still friends he gets upset if I do. How do I get rid of this toxicity in my life when it's hard to get away from?"
"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) backtracked on his invitation ! Obligatory ThrowAway Account ! 

My MIL asked my boyfriend to invite me on their family road trip out of town. He immediately hesitated, and to take him out of the awkward position, I laughed and told his mom that that seemed like a no. It honestly hurt. 

They took a family road trip last weekend and when his two best friends couldn't make it, he asked his coworker/friend (who we both find creepy). As soon as he said I'm bringing so-and-so, I felt down and lonely. His mom has asked him to invite me to family gatherings before but he has chosen to take his coworker instead. 

I teased him about not wanting me to go on the trip and he kept insisting that it wasn't like he didn't want me to go. It was that he had thought about it but saw that the trip was a while from now so he didn't ask me. He then asks me if I want to go and I obviously say yes. I continue to tease him about a bit more but I drop the subject pretty soon after. My day with him ends and he drops me off at my place. I ask him when will his next off day will be so I can visit him. He says Tuesday, and then goes, ""Oh but I'm going on the road trip. If I come back early I'll let you know."" That to me obviously sounds like he was never planning to ask me to go, and despite asking me if I would like to, he didn't mean it and did not take my answer seriously. 

I wanted to talk to my mom about it but she said ""Don't go. As if you would want to go."" That didn't help at all and I'm still pretty sad about it. Before seeing him today, we had been distant and not talking as often for two weeks. I've been hurting a lot and him hesitating/taking back his invitation to the trip makes me feel even more alone than the last two weeks. 

We've only been dating for six months so maybe he just isn't ready to involve me too much. However, I am. I really want a future with him and I'm starting to think that he doesn't. I'm not even his second or third choice and I will never be his first. I don't want to feel like seventh place anymore. 

If Monday night comes around and he hasn't told me anything about the trip to prepare for it, will I be a bitch by calling him out? My instinct tells me that I should step away from the situation as much as possible, to take a break, and to not reach out for him so fucking much. But if I stop caring then why the fuck are we dating?????  I wanted to be nice and tell him that it was okay if he didn't want me to go but I couldn't get the words out. I feel like maybe my teasing was actually me just pressuring him. I didn't want to pressure him, I was just coping with the rejection by making fun of it. I'm at a loss on what to do. Do I pretend like nothing ever happened? Should I just stop caring so much until my relationship dies? Do I call him out now, despite not having steady communication lately? Do I wait to see what happens on Tuesday??"
"Girlfriend (17f) Thinks I (16m) cheated on her because of my ex, and her being toxic. Also, a large mistake on my part. Could use some help. Okay, well, lets just start it from the beginning. My girlfriend and I have been talking since late march. I had gotten out of a break up prior to that. Lets call the girl E. E is a toxic person. E has ruined two relationships in my past because I left her. Using accusations of cheating and fake screenshots and timestamps. Last night, my girlfriend was contacted by E with a ton of these timestamps of me talking to her. Problem is, i have proof that I blocked E's instagram on april 6th. And the timestamps and screenshots date past that. But my fuck up, is i forgot to block her on snapchat, of all things until april 30th. I blocked her then and i went on with it. My girlfriend and I seemingly have come to a solution and we still love eachother. But I know shes still uneasy and doesnt trust me as much. What can I do to regain her trust and prove to her even further that I love her? Im out of ideas and could use some help. Thanks."
"ThrowRA [19m], i think my sister[23f] and her boyfriend[~22?m] are stuck in a toxic relstionship with each other and i wonder if i should try to end it myself? why do i think its toxic?
every week now i hear them argue in the house. its mostly my sister talking. the nature of the arguments is almost always my sister telling his boyfriend to stop being a dick. he tries to explain himself, which usually involves defending himself, then my sister always tells him hes wrong and that he needs to say sorry. he stands his ground, then she begins to scream repeating herself saying he was mad and it made her feel scared. and then she freaks out more and cries when he threatens to leave. i hear modt of the arguments, they seem to have almost no substance. just ""babe please stoppp stopp stop baelbe stopp PLEASEEE STOPPP ARE YOU SERIOUS STOPP STOPPP"" that was me acting as my sister. it seems she is very dogmatic, boyfriend doesnt take her shit, and she freaks out because she cant win the argument and hes not budging. she acts very desperate unlike boyfriend. from my understanding, she said she wants to make up with him, and she really wants to. she gets very emotional when he threatens to leave in the middle of an argument and desperately repeats and cries/screams ""PLEASEE"" in an argument. and rn im hearing her cry out ""PLEASE im TRyING TO MAKE THIS WORK WE CAN TALK IT OUT""

not just these arguments show toxicity, but boyftiend is afraid of offending her. when they hang out, sister says something like hes annoying or tells him to stop doing something and the boyfriend becomes afraid of doing something that she doesnt like and he apologizes a lot. she often has a problem with what boyfriend does.example: he makes a joke, she says hes being really annoying and its not funny and for him to stop, he quickly is like ""sorry sorry sorry"" and tries to act cute

another reason is they seem to not relate to each other. when i hear them talk its always about jokes nothing deep, and its the boyfriend making the jokes. this helps suggests that the boyfriend feels hes always walking on eggshells.

why are they still together? i heard fron my mom he stays away from home. abusive parents? my sister i am not sure about. but it seems clear to me that they want to be in a relationship badly or theyre trying to stay for the sake of their past or something?

this has been happening for 6 months to a year now

they have been together for 3 years now? or so.

ive been tempted to text the boyfriend that he doesnt need to handle this arguing and stress  i considered having a long conversation with him. if i talk with anyone of them itll be with the boyfriend because i cant reason with my sister usually. the question is is it okay to intervene in somebody elses relationship and is it ok to do it here and if so what should i say? i just think that if i say nothing theyll be together for another year or marry unhappily with each other and live miserable lives."
telling my parents i want to go to therapy? i’m 18F but my insurance is under my parents name. they’re really strict and foreign and don’t really believe in therapy. my ex boyfriend was physically abusive it was traumatic and it’s really affecting me and i want to see someone to help me heal from it. is there any way i can go to therapy without telling them?
"I (27F) Just Started A New Relationship I want to do this one right. I really like this guy. 

What are some things I should remember to establish now, that you wish you had earlier in a relationship?

What sort of questions do I need to be asking to make sure we are on the same page?

What precedents do you wish you had set at the beginning of your relationship?"
"Need Closure I made a post on here about a month ago about what happened with my gf, and why it happened. Fast forward to now, she still hasnt reached out to me and her family is being very silent about it. I recently went to go drop some Animal Crossing figures off for her, and I expected her mom to answer the door and take them. But my ex-gf actually came to the door, and when she saw me she ran off. Then her brother and his wife answered the door, and took the figures, while being pretty passive agressive about how I couldnt come inside because the house was a mess. Im stuck here now, im not sure if shes getting better and just doesnt feel she can handle talking to me or if she just doesnt want to talk to me at all. I would hope her mom would text me if say, she didnt want me back at the house or she didnt want to see me again but I havent gotten a text from her. I feel like im losing my mind, being trapped inside all day and I dont know what the person I truthfully love is feeling or if she even hates me. I know I need to just wait because a lot of shitty stuff is happening, like the virus, and other things in her families life like a divorce. But its hard, especially when I just want to know if she even wants to ever talk to me ever again."
"Anxiety or Gut Feeling? My (23F) boyfriend (26M) and i’s relationship is seemingly perfect on paper. We never fight, both very laid back, spend 24/7 together but I’m getting extreme relationship anxiety and I don’t know why because he doesn’t do anything particularly wrong. 

He’s the first person though since my very emotionally abusive ex from 3 years ago that I’ve felt like “wow, I really like this person” BUT the relationship itself is giving me extreme anxiety like how I felt at the end of my break up with the abusive ex. I’ve dated other people in between the two but I’ve never felt like this and the anxiety has never popped up. The people I’ve dated between the two have also been extremely clingy. My new boyfriend is definitely the opposite. 

Do you think this is a red flag? Or just my anxiety talking? 

It’s definitely the first healthy relationship I’ve ever had but something feels off with the anxiety."
"How Do I Tell My Dad To Butt Out Without Upsetting Him? Hi y’all,


I’m currently in a little predicament. I have been no contact with my mother for around 6 months. In my opinion she is a very narcissistic and manipulative person and I want no part in continuing to indulge her so I cut it off. The last straw was her being gross and demeaning to my father (not a new thing) and not giving my younger sister the antibiotics my father got for her from the doctor when she was unwell in leu of her alternative medicines (oils and tree bark or something idk).

I have no problem telling her to leave me alone, which she has not cared to listen to so is now blocked on almost every platform. The issue currently is with my dad. I love my dad to pieces, he really got the short end of the stick being with my mother (they have been divorced for around 9 years).  Every now and again he will send me a text asking me to check in with her, and since it’s Mother’s Day tomorrow where I am he sent me a text near guilt tripping messaging her: 

“Hey OP. Tomorrow is an important day for your mother. She still loves you and would make her day if you would let her know that your still her daughter. Even a card without your name on it.
Anything will be better than nothing... and nothing, well... that’s up to you. I want you to think seriously about tomorrow.”

I feel mad and guilty and I hate this. How do I tell my dad that he’s not helping the situation and just making me upset, without making him upset? Please help."
"my (25m) gf (23f) and I are on a break and I’m struggling Good morning, thank you for taking the time to read this and give me your thoughts

I’ve been with this girl for awhile and I love her to death.  But my communication skills are lacking.  I’m trying to work on it because I haven’t been in a relationship in a long time.  I’ve also been a workaholic.  We’ve been arguing over the last month due to the stress of the lockdown, and the last time she was over I kinda let her know that we should distance ourselves a bit with the lockdown, since we both have vulnerable family members.  At the time she seemed fine with it, but it’s been eating at her.  Now, it became a flare point for one of our arguments.  To complicate things, we are of opposite faiths and while I’m not particularly devout, she is.  This is a special month for her and I’ve been trying to take that into account, but pressures at home and her culture demands her to be married by a certain age.  As romantic and poetic it is of eloping together, I realize we aren’t financially ready for that decision yet.  Nor is it a mature way of solving a dilemma.  As much as possible I would love to include her family but she doubts I will be able to handle their conservativeness and disapproval.

Because of our constant arguments and my inconsistency in being a boyfriend she decided for us to go on a break. I told her before that I wouldn’t do that and that I’d rather end things or settle it and that worked and we were happy for a good year or so.  

She has some challenges and insecurities that have been nipping at her heels and our fighting only compounds her stress.  She mentioned she’d rather be alone and with her friends and affirmed her feelings.  Before she left I asked her when the break would be over and she told me when she comes back to my place.  It’s been a week now and she reached out to me via text on Monday.  I kept things relatively cool but I misunderstood why she was upset and I feel like she has lost faith in us.  Outside of that interaction I’ve been respecting her space and have not contacted her.  I’m a mess and I’ve been crying and almost giving in to texting or calling her during my moments of weakness.  I’ve been keeping things busy but I want there to be a future.  

I’m sorry for the wall of text.  I’m just feeling like crap and the fact that I don’t know how she’s feeling terrifies me.  There’s a creeping realization that I don’t deserve to know because my own decisions caused her to feel this way.

Thank you for making it this far.  Please be as brutally honest.  Upvote/downvote away I don’t care I just want some advice.  I’m in that weird stage where you realize this is a break up but also that you would be willing to fight the world to be with that person.  Throughout the day my mind and heart are just wavering between sadness and hope. Until then, I’m patiently waiting until she makes contact again to talk about this."
"My Insecurities are ruining my relationship. Hello! 

Trying to keep it simple. I (27F) have a wonderful boyfriend (26M). He has never given me a reason to think he would cheat, lie, or hurt me. 

For some reason, I think this is too good to be true and will doubt if he means what he says and it’s been causing serious problems and hurting his feeling a lot. 

For example, last night he asked if we wanted to watch a show online before bed. I said yes and texted him to let him know I was going to work out and then call him that night:

“Okay no rush baby, I don’t have work tomorrow.”

“Oh wait, you do lol”

Seems absolutely innocent. But me being paranoid is taking this as: “is he making fun of me for having to work?” “Is he insinuating I should go to bed early so he doesn’t have to talk to me and do other things?” “Did he even want to watch a show in the first place?”

I explained how I felt but it turned into a huge fight coming down to me overthinking everything he says and doubting who he is as a person. He says why would he even offer to call me and talk that night if he didn’t want to.

I know it’s not fair to him, he’s so good to me. I love him and I don’t want to hurt him like this.

How do I fix being paranoid like this for no reason?

Thanks so much for any advice..."
"He (28) looks away every time I (27f) look back at him I’ve known this guy for over a year, but for most of that time, I had a boyfriend. We’re neighbors and I’d frequently catch him looking at me outside, but I didn’t think much of it. He also would only ever say hi to me if he saw me with my then-boyfriend, but he’d make a point of asking “how are you?” while looking only at me. Again, I figured it was nothing.

Months ago, we were talking and he would not break eye contact with me at all. He also leaned in so close to me that I got nervous and brought up my boyfriend. The next time I saw him, I was walking and when I turned, I saw him staring at me from across the street. As soon as I caught him, he immediately looked away and practically ran away. He avoided me for a long time after that.

The other day, we bumped into each other as I was heading into the laundry room as he was leaving. He said hi to me. I was then startled to see him standing there looking at his phone when I looked up. I don’t know why else he’d follow me in there except to try to talk to me. He left as soon as I noticed him. 

The next day I saw him and we locked eyes. I smiled at him and he didn’t smile back - he just whipped out his phone and waited for me to go by without saying hi or anything. 

When I went to do laundry yesterday, he happened to be in there talking on the phone. I think he said hi but my back was turned so I’m not sure. He went off into another area, but as I was heading back his way, he rushed over to the door like he was trying to run into me. When I looked at him, he looked away. He then followed me back out. 

I’ve also seen him with his friends and they all stared hard at me and one of them tried calling my dog over. When I walked by a few minutes later, his friends were gone like he shooed them away. I also caught him staring at me from his car when I happened to walk by the other day and again he immediately looked away. 

Is he interested in me but just really shy? He also probably doesn’t know that I’m single now. I’m really shy myself so it kills me when I try smiling at him but he looks away."
"4 year relationship put on break I’ve been dating my girlfriend for four years now and out of the blue she tells me she wants a weak break to think about what she wants in the future. She always talked about getting married in the future but when I brought up living together next year she said things were moving too fast and we were “too comfortable” around each other. She has seemed off for about a month and is horrible at sharing her feelings. She sent this to me in a Snapchat after we spent a weekend together with no apparent problems. The worst part is she never explained anything and basically told me to not talk to her for a week, which has me thinking of all sorts of worst case scenarios."
"My (25F) BF (25M) searches for IG models and his ex's profile on Instagram, which makes me feel inadequate and also follows Dan Blizerian. Also the first thing he talks about when he speaks about any woman is her attractiveness. We have been together for around 7 months now, and most of it is great - he has a great sense of humor, the sex is awesome and we have a lot of fun. However whenever he opens his IG to show me something and I see his search bar, I can see the recent searches which include IG models (who post sexy pictures all the time) and his ex's handle. I haven't confronted him about this because if I do I think he might start hiding things from me. I feel bad about this because I'm so faithful and involved in this, and I never think about anyone else. Also when he talks about any female he'll always talk about how hot or not she is. However I have noticed this trend in all the men I know, they follow hot women, they watch porn and fantasize about other people. I find this kind of gross and unidimensional and being a feminist I find it degrading that he views women through one angle only. However I still enjoy being with him and frankly I feel that all men are like that (around me especially), and if I want to be in a relationship I have to accept that men have this obsessive need/habit to look at hot women and just accept that they're with me for for deeper reasons. 
Is this true? Is there any hope for me to find someone who is not like that? Or should I just remain single forever because this bothers me?"
"I (22/F) am very open about my feelings but my love interest (26/M) has massive difficulty talking about pretty much everything lately... What to do? So, for background we both like each other, made that vocal.

We both came out a 3 year relationship with our ex's about 2 month after each other (strange, I know!)
After that we began talking more again, and he admitted he still liked me from way back. I still love him.
Agreeing that when we are ready to date it's possible we would date each other to see where it goes. 

Lately he has been sort of ghosting me, when I message to ask why his leaving me on ""R"" he says his sorry but talking isn't easy and nor is communicating. 
I understand genuinely men do struggle but it seems more like he is suddenly much more reluctant to even talk to me

It's really painful for me because I really believed he wanted to actually be with me
Now with the ghosting and absence I feel so confused and hurt. 

What can I do to make him feel more comfortable talking with me again?"
"ThrowRA How to help partner that dealt with abortion from rape? Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been dating this girl for a few months now and she's told me her previous ex she had dated a year ago had done (in the title). She was really hesitant to tell me because she thought I'd run away, but I really like this girl and told her she hadn't done anything wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Her behaviour in terms of interests and lack of many hobbies gives me this feeling that she hasn't completely healed/able to move past it. I'm basing this purely on her past experiences and adventures. She also doesn't even hang out with friends which really fuels my gut feeling about this. I want to know what's the best way to help her move on and heal so we can have a chance at a future together.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be nice, thank you."
"Snapping vs unconscious response when you’re mad? Me and my boyfriend keep getting into uncomfortable silly arguments, when I do it he feels I’m snapping at him and feel I’m unkind (usually would be eye rolling or ugh! Or maybe even some childish sign of frustration sometimes with words when I lose my patience. He stays feeling odd and like questioning if he even want to be with someone who “snaps at him”. 


But when he does it and most of the times say some rude mean comment just to hurt me, and he regret it right after and he says sorry I wasn’t thinking and I forgive and let go because I can understand what unconscious response are and I know that it’s just because his ego got hurt and we move on.

Today after 3 days of back and forth with I wonder if it isn’t the same thing what I do and what he does. But when I snap and say I’m sorry I wasn’t thinking he just stays feeling ewk like who’s this woman?. I would appreciate different perspectives"
"I feel like my boyfriend and I don’t talk anymore First time poster, apologies if there are errors! I (24F) currently live with my boyfriend (27M) we have been together for almost 2 years and have lived together for around 8 months. Overall I think we have a good relationship and I truly envision him to be my long term partner. He is supportive, caring, and everything I want in a partner. The one problem I’ve noticed is I feel like we don’t really talk anymore, I think this has been exacerbated by the covid-19 situation as we are now both WFH and around each other 24/7, where I used to travel for work Mon - Thurs of every week. The adjustment to us being around each other all the time has honestly not been a problem, we are both happy to be doing individual things while in each others presence, so I don’t think that has caused any additional strain. But it has created a unique situation where now that we’re around each other all the time it just doesn’t feel like we have anything to talk about, we’re well aware of each other’s day because we spent it literally together. Prior to the current world events I had felt like our conversations had been lacking, but this has definitely increased the issue, and I’m not sure what to do. To be completely transparent I am also watching my close friend go through the new relationship phase, so I think that has heightened my awareness to it. I would appreciate any advice on how other couples have dealt with keeping up communication while being constant companions. Thanks!"
"My [32F] work situation is very difficult. I had a great job before, but due to the COVID-19, we were all temporarily laid off. My boss encouraged us all to file for unemployment, but I couldn't figure out the website. After a week, I gave up trying for unemployment and got a new job somewhere else.

Turns out this ""somewhere else"" is horrible. It's a detox center. They have a really high turnover rate. A lot of people call in sick or just quit randomly. More and more people are being forced to work split shifts or 16 hours in a row. 

I'm still training. I'm pretty competent, for the most part, but there are a few coworkers who treat me like a moron, and when people do that I find myself growing smaller and smaller, almost ACTING like a moron because I know that's what they expect of me. It's like I'm so obedient that I become whatever people need, whether it's a scapegoat or a lackey, whatever. I feel like I don't have a personality here because I'm so afraid all the time. 

There are a lot of former addicts working here and they are really mean, horrible people. I've never struggled with addiction, so I can't relate to them, and I can't relate to a lot of the clients either. But I'm soft-hearted, and I like the clients! A lot! They're funny and smart as hell. And not all my coworkers are bad, either. It's just the ones that have been there so long so they're really jaded and moody, and they're used to everyone kissing their ass and navigating around their mood swings. But those ones are bad enough. 

I find myself feeling burnt out and shrinking internally. I'm afraid to stand up for myself. My mom was an addict and highly abusive during my childhood. (She's fine now.) I's the same type of pattern with my coworkers as it was with her. I can't deal with it. I moved away from my mom to be free of that. I don't want to be near it again.

After I got home from work today I tried to strangle myself with a belt, and when that didn't work, I poured out a glass of bleach. 

I wish I could die. I don't want to work here for the rest of my life. I want my old job back. I'm looking for new jobs already but I feel bad. They need me here. I just don't want to be here at all."
"Roommate (22M) doesn't contribute to household and Me (24F) and Partner (22M) are fed up Alex = my partner

Ed = roommate

So about half a year ago me and Alex decided to move in with one of his close friends. Ed lived

in the middle of nowhere and this made it extremely difficult for him to finish his school degree or get a drivers license. Alex wanted to help out his friend and we all agreed that he’d move down and live with us but there were a few conditions.

The first condition was he wouldn't cost us money and he was expected to get a job. We agreed that it would take him a month or two to find said job since there are many available. At the time we were both making minimum wage and didn't have any extra money to spare. We expected him to take care of his own groceries and chip in for utilities.

The second condition was that while he was still living off welfare he’d do the majority of the chores around the house.

We all agreed to the terms and Alex was particularly excited because he'd have his close friend finally living nearby and he was able to help him get his life back on track.

At first everything was alright however we started to notice that Ed did nothing around the house and would often leave the kitchen a mess. Alex and I are not OCD but we do expect that the kitchen is left clean after use. Ed would game all day instead of doing chores and we were upset since that was of course not what was agreed upon. We were also a bit bothered that Ed never contributed to the shared groceries like milk, butter, eggs, etc… Alex and I were constantly buying food but we’d notice we ran out quite frequently, especially since we rarely cooked due to our busy work schedules. This also extended to soda we bought for ourselves, water bottles, and popsicles.

We talked to Ed about being tidier and contributing more but I didn’t want to call him out on taking our food. I made up a chore list for each person so we all knew what was expected of us. Ed agreed that the list was fair and we moved on.

Then we noticed that Ed still wasn't doing his chores and his room stank to the point where his B.O. was coming through the vents and we’d often be able to smell him in our room and the living room. When quarantine hit we finally realized why his room smelled so much. He barely showers, maybe once a month, and he still barely contributes to chores or any shared groceries.

We once again talked to him about the chores and tried to gently suggest that the whole apartment should be aired out at least once a week. I wasn't surprised when nothing changed so we sat Ed down again and gave him an ultimatum. We told him that if he doesn't change dramatically we won't be moving into another apartment with him.

I would like some advice on how to deal with this situation. Alex and I don't want to send Ed back to where he was living before but we both feel like he doesn't want to change or at least doesn't put effort to try to change. I know Ed’s family has kind of given up on him doing anything with his life and have already expressed to us to return him when we’re sick of him but I don't want to give up on him. He doesn't mean to cause us frustration but we’re constantly providing things for him while he just sits in his room all day and plays games. I don't want Alex and Ed’s relationship to be impacted but I know Alex feels like Ed’s taken advantage of us. What should I do? We’ve had so many talks with Ed about how his laziness isn't acceptable, especially since we listed our conditions before he moved down, that I don't think there's any way to get through to him."
"I’m stuck in my relationship because of the lockdown. My partner (25M) and I (22F) live together, but we haven’t had sex for 9 months, and spend all day in separate rooms. 

I’ve been wanting to leave for a while now. We’ve had so many talks where he’s promised to change, but nothing ever comes from it. We barely talk, we don’t cuddle.. it honestly feels like i’m more of a maid than a girlfriend. The only thing i’m good for is cleaning the house and cooking his food. 

Our tenancy ends next month, and i’d been planning to break off the relationship and move out. My problem is that I can’t move during the pandemic because money is tight and house viewings are limited to video calls. 

If we renew the tenancy, we’ll be living together for at least another 6 months. I don’t think I can do it. The relationship is mentally exhausting. I don’t even have anyone that I can talk to about it all. 

I have no idea what to do. I have no friends or family that I can stay with, and I feel like ending the relationship while sharing the house would create a hostile environment."
"Is it ending? My GF (22F) is really sad over past week, I (22M) didn't really knew what was going on, since she didn't want to tell me, so she won't ""make me sad"". When she finally opened up, I learned that she thinks we're very different (which is true) and that she is ready for things that I am not ready for. (She's been in a couple of relationships so far, this is my first one) She said that she is not as happy with me as she would like to be. Everything was triggered by one of her former classmates getting engaged and was revolving mainly around it, she just thinks that our relationship is stuck in place. She said I'm important to her (and so is she to me) and she tries her best so our relationship can survive this, she told me that she will wait until I'm ready, but here's the thing. I have no idea what to think and do about it all, I don't really want to make any seriulois moves untill I get a degree and maybe (it's not certain in my country) a good paying job, which we could live off of. Any advice will be helpful."

EDIT:sorry for some of the bad wording"
"How do we (34F &amp; 36M) break our promise to our friend (42M) about our future plans to live together? My fiancé and I work and live together in a situation that we have been wanting to leave for a while. We want to move together to a beautiful area outside our city in SE Australia, get new jobs, and live simply and quietly somewhere pretty. This has been the Dream for a while.

About a year ago, a really close friend was brutally dumped by his gf (who we will name Pig) of nearly a decade and found himself in a really bad state.

He’s a loving, intelligent and tender man. He’s also a severe alcoholic and spends most of his piddly welfare on cheap wine, tobacco and weed. He suffers his disease, physically and mentally. Despite that, he is the sweetest friend you could ever have. He’s an avid cook, kind, generous - in every way a good person. He’s tried to sober up before and we’ve been supportive and encouraging. We’ve also been understanding and accepting when he’s fallen off the wagon.

Pig destroyed him when they broke up. She deliberately fucked him around as much as she could, kept all their shared possessions, bragged to him about her sexual conquests and how they outperformed him, etc. etc. - all while he was homeless, jobless and destitute.

We were as supportive as we could be, but our accommodation is literally within our workplace and provided by our employer - we could have lost our jobs for putting him up. But we talked through the bad times with him and helped him financially as much as we could.

Our jobs were really intense around that time, and we knew we wanted to get out of our current living/working situation. After lengthy discussion, fiancé and I invited our friend to live with us when we could eventually move house, even though we knew it would be several months before it could happen. He was thrilled.

Maybe 8 months since then, after some rough sleeping early on, a bit of couch-surfing and a couple of short-term sublets, he’s found a share-house with a bunch of 20-somethings. So he’s doing better, but not great, and he’s really looking forward to moving in with us.

We got really close to making the Dream happen in February, until … well, yeah. New house and new job? lol no. The Dream was put on hold, but it continues to sustain our friend during his quarantine cabin-fever with his youthful housemates.

Here’s the thing though – we’ve changed our minds about wanting to live with him.

We love him for who he is, and we invited him to live with us because we wanted to shelter our friend after a horrible break-up, give him the opportunity to recover and choose for himself what to do with his new Pig-free life. We pictured a medium sized house where he could have his own bit of space, we had our own bit of space, and we could just be three mates enjoying a lovely life together. We were going to get him a cat.

We each speak to our friend independently and together almost every day. But after seeing him for the first time in months a couple of weeks ago, a few realities about what it would be like to actually live with him have sunk in.

He’s notoriously unreliable. We have a dog, what if he passed out on the couch and left old KFC bones out? Could we trust him to care for her if we wanted to go away for a night? Would he be able to keep up with his share of the rent? Would he be forever “borrowing” money from us? We've ""loaned"" him quite a bit over the last year and never expected him to pay us back, but our finances will be a lot tighter when we leave our current jobs. The area we want to move to is pretty secluded with sporadic bus services, so without a licence he wouldn't be able to get any work up there.

The houses in this area are all either cute little cottages or big multi-bedroom family homes, and the cost difference is significant. ""Medium"" is not an option. It’s a very competitive rental market, 3 people co-signing a lease automatically gets looked over, so it would be our names on a lease with an illegal sublease. What if we signed our names on a big family home and we wound up stuck paying rent we couldn’t afford? Or he caused damage we couldn’t fix?

We want a veggie patch. He agreed, and is excited to grow weed on our rental property and sell it from our home (which is very, very illegal). We’ve already straight up said we don’t like this idea but I think he thought we were joking? We want privacy and quiet, not randos rolling up to our house at all hours and we certainly don’t want cop trouble.

We love our friend and we care for him deeply. But we’ve come to the slow realisation that if we lived with him, we would be more like his parents than friends or housemates.

More than anything else though, we’re in our mid-30s. We're getting married soon. We might want kids. We’ve realised that we selfishly want the next place we live to be about us – our own little haven where we can choose who visits and when. Our current working/living situation affords us very little privacy, and we've realised just how important that is to both of us and our relationship. We feel awful, but we’re just not willing to take so many risks (personal, financial, legal and canine) and compromise our Dream for his.

How can we have the conversation that breaks our promise, without hurting our friend and damaging our friendship?

TL:DR We invited our alcoholic friend to live with us when we eventually move, but now that we’re getting closer to the reality we realise we would prefer to live alone, but he’s really excited about it. How can we talk to him about it without crushing him?"
"Boyfriend (19M) won’t talk to me (F19) or express himself. This post is about my boyfriend , who gets in these moods every other day or every few days. Where he seems like he has an attitude or something’s bothering him. You know just not himself. Difference in his tone, sighing and body language. When he gets in these moods I’ll typically ask him what’s wrong or why does he sound like he has an attitude or why does he sound so down. His response will just be ..nothing. Most of the time I’ll leave it alone and end up getting irritated myself because I feel like if something’s wrong or you’re in a certain mood you should be able to talk to me.  I can’t be there for you or etc if you aren’t able to communicate. When I explain that to him he says he still working on it. &amp; he’ll joke and always say “You know I have my moments”. He had one of his moments today &amp; I asked him why’d he sound so down today..and he responded with “Isn’t this everyday”. Any idea what this could be? Bipolar disorder? Depression? Advice on how I should go about this."

"I (21M) possibly caught my GF (20F) cheating Me and my GF are together 6 years now and i already proposed to her.

Soo i couldn't go to sleep last night, so i played games. When i finally went to the bed (where my GF was already sleeping) i stumbled upon her phone which wasn't locked because she fell a sleep while browsing IG. I was curious, so the first thing i opened was messages. Then i stumbled upon a several texts with her male friend.

Translating from my language

Her: I want to be by your side right now

Him: I know

Her: I suppose you do too

Him: yeah

Him: but...

Him: Goodnight

I was furious! So i immediately woke her up and asked what the \*\*\*\* is this? To what she replyed that that was not as it seemed to me, and that that was a text meaning that she just wanted to talk with him about stuff.

NOTE: She lied about past messages a lot, first saying she hasn't texted him since february, then saying she doesn't delete her past messages if they are not old, then she say's that she deleted yesterday's messages. Soo clearly she was lying a lot.

Soo please reddit, any advice? I feel crushed by this.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: She also mentioned that she just wanted some attention and then started telling me my problems and why she did it. When i asked her how far this all went she replyed that they never met, and that this is the farthest that it got.

EDIT2: I contacted the guy. He told me that nothing really happened besides these texts, but those texts happened not once as he sayd. We both agreed that he should avoid her and never text her. But the big problem remains and i am still trying to figure out what really should i do."
Drugs and relationships - the last straw My boyfriend is often complaining about how he doesn’t have anyone to do molly or acid with. I overdid those substances so much in that past to the point that they completely turn me off. He makes me feel so guilty that I won’t take them with him. He makes it feel like I don’t truly love him if I won’t do it. This has been our biggest relationship problem as it as an almost daily discussion. It creates so much tension. I just don’t know what to do anymore.
"Would it be rude if after I told my ex I would help them to change my mind and cut ties instead? My ex (23m) and I (23f) still text sometimes. A little backstory: I’m stationed in Korea, he is about to be stationed here. He was asking for advice and I gave it to him. I also have a really hard standing up for myself and place boundaries because I still care about him despite the shit he put  me through. It’s dumb, I know. 

I offered to help him when he got here, to show him the transportation systems here and the ins and outs of Korea because it can be a bit overwhelming at first. 

The problem is that I am starting to realize that he is not my responsibility anymore. I don’t owe anything to him and as much as it hurts, I can’t be there for him. Especially when he wasn’t there for me. 

I finally deleted our messages, which was huge for me. I was going on to unfriend him and everything but I’m hesitant because I already offered him help and I don’t like going back on my word. Maybe I can tell him to text me when he gets here and I’ll help them? To the point though, would it be rude if I told him, “sorry, I can’t help you. I need to move on. Good luck.” Or something to that regards and then cut ties? 

Side note: he will have other people to help him. He might not know them, but they will be people he’s gonna be working with. 

Thanks in advance."
"How can I be a better friend/brother/son/bf etc I (late 20s) am finding a repeating pattern where I struggle to extend myself for people that I love and appreciate. Like yeah I'm introverted but I have this weird hang up where if I'm not 100% cheerful and full of energy I won't reach out and I withdraw. 

Maybe I fear I'll come across as boring or leave a bad impression? Or maybe rejection if I ask people to hang out? I'm in therapy the whole nine yards and actually improving to be honest...but does anyone else go through this? And how do you cope with being social when not feeling ""perfect"""
"Dead Bedroom I honestly don't know whether or not to even post this. I literally have no one to talk to about it. 

My husband and I have been together for less than 3 years. When we met, we had sex pretty often. But ever since we got married (November 2019), it's just been going downhill ever since. I always have to try to initiate sex, and even then I get rejected. He usually waits until I'm asleep and then tries to initiate, and by that time I'm just like ""well, I have to take it when I can get it."" Since getting together, we have gone from a couple of times a week to maybe once a week or two weeks, then to now, when I haven't had any in over a month. I literally just brought this up just a few minutes ago and he said: ""go rub one out or something."" 

I cannot even begin to explain how much this pissed me off. I know for a fact that he's not cheating, as all he ever does is work and come home, get drunk, and play Xbox. His excuse when it started dwindling was ""we're not married"" and, now that we are, he just doesn't have one? 

He tells me that if I cheated on him, he'd be done with me automatically. So basically I'm stuck in this dead bedroom situation. Other than that, we are fine. He pays for my schooling, he allows me to not have to work a lot so I can do my schooling, we get along great and have inside jokes, and it's just the dead bedroom that bothers me. He's basically my best friend I tell everything to, and it seems like a platonic friendship despite the fact that we're married.

Am I wrong in thinking that I need more than financial stability? Maybe some sexual stability is too much to ask when I'm being well taken care of financially?"
"Color struck boyfriend and his porn addiction I made a throw away because my boyfriend is always on reddit but anyway, me (20 F) and my boyfriend (25 M) have been together for about 2 years. Let’s call him Malik. Both of us are black. I am a black woman with Caribbean roots and I would say I’m brown skin, and Malik is a black man with Caribbean roots from his father’s side and his mother is an American black woman; I am lighter in complexion compared to him. 

Our relationship is great for the most part but one thing that has been bothering me is that I notice he jacks often and he only jacks to women who are super light skin, white passing, white, and light Latina. We both have passwords to each other’s phones and we both invade each other’s privacy because we don’t care. We’re both very possessive of each other and like to know everything about each other and it doesn’t feel like a big deal. 

We’re also both Leos.

Anyway, he has shown investment towards me. He pays majority of the rent and intends to pay it entirely by himself in the future. We live together and he provides the groceries, sometimes my makeup, he pays for my nails twice a month and he pays for most things I ask him to pay for. We have a more traditional relationship and I take care of the domestic chores and if I work, I dont intend to help with anything financially except for making investments and saving for our parents and our retirement (we had a conversation and agreed we would have a very detailed and specific pre-nup in the future; my idea because I expect to be very financially successful in the future and I don’t want to be stupid). I’ll also take care of my future children whenever they need me, he will help too as they would be his kids. We don’t have any kids yet but we had the conversation about how our finances would be handled.

Anyway, his p*rn preferences have begun to take a toll on my self esteem because he also has a p*rn addiction and uses a lot of apps on his phone to view naked women. He will never pay for p*rn but I’ve never seen someone go through lengths to find leaked videos and photos from girl’s Only Fans. I don’t ever expect him to cheat on me, but I’m not trying to invest my prime years with someone that is THIS color struck. 
I don’t care if he looks at naked women to jack to but WHERE ARE THE BLACK WOMEN LIKE SH*T!!!

My fear is that he will one day leave me to be with a white or super light skin woman.
I think he is ashamed of his preference and I realllyyy want to ask him why he’s with me but I don’t know how because it’s an awkward conversation. 

I’m not light skin or white, I’m brown skin. I am naturally “thick” (I have a really big butt and thighs and my ratios line up with another fetish of his because he’s what you would call an “ass man”) and so it feels like he doesn’t want to be criticized for being with who he really wants to be with and he’s settling for me because I check off other things on his list. 

Anyway, we both have high sex drives and I also had my first time with him. He used to pursue me so much for sex and now it feels like he only wants it once a day but he can go a few days without caring if he gets it and seems to prefer his hand. I know it can’t be that my “kitty” is trash because he doesn’t last that long in bed and gets it up very easily for me. Tbh all I have to do is bend over in front of him and he is gonna be ready to go. I think he just likes to masturbate but like why is it all light skin and white and every other woman that is far from Black? He’s dated darker complexioned black women in his past, some darker than me but I’ve only ever noticed him struggle to get over the ones who were light skin. 

Being a race first black woman, all of this bothers me. Outside of masturbating he appears to be race first and about his people but his porn collection got me like wtffff. 
I’ve been with guys who fetishized me for my big butt and my Caribbean accent. I was discarded because they only wanted sex from me and I could see that and wouldn’t put out. I feel like he’s settling for me but it doesn’t make sense because he’s said he wouldn’t be doing the things he does for me for any girls he dated in the past and tbh if I didn’t know about his collection I would assume everything between us is a miracle to find so early in life because of the levels he goes through to invest in me and my growth.
But I can’t be with a man who is as color struck as he appears. I don’t want to deal with him leaving me for a light skin or white woman once he’s exactly where he wants to be financially. He said he’d never date outside of his race for the purpose of preservation and I’m only into black men who date within their race. I just am.

What would you do if you were in a situation where your partner’s racial or complexion preference didn’t align with you? 

What should I do? I really love him but i need assurance on everything. This is my life and I want to make smart decisions of who I spend it with.

Also, there have been times in our relationship where he would pretend to joke around and call me anything but a black woman. He calls me a “spicy” black woman I guess because of my accent and Caribbean roots (though he has Caribbean roots on his dad’s side, he grew up very American and I guess me being an island girl excites him) and on an another occasion, he looked at me with some twinkle in his eye and said “you know what, you kind of look mixed😍” and on another occasion he kept calling me Latina... I am not... um.. I understand my specific accent just happens to be similar but I’m not Latina. I’m Haitian."
"Should I let go of this friend or keep trying? Hi, I need some friendship advice on someone I’ve been close to for 4 years-ish. At one point this person was my best friend and we got along great with one another but over time I began to feel like we weren’t friends as much. I’ll list instances below but we met in high school and now I’ve moved away and I’m in university. I’ll also give her the initial ‘A’. 

- At first it was smaller things, where once for example a few years ago she was going to this fair this with her friend (who I am also friends with just not as much). She could have invited me if she wanted to and I found it odd since we hung out a lot, if I remember correctly she insinuated we could go together if her other friend couldn’t go. 
- She Hates nearly all of my other friends. For example she doesn’t like one of them because of an argument they had when we were 14/15. (It was over nothing). More recently, I have made amazing uni friends but when I said something about how staying at uni was easier, rather than going home, she said she was more important than my uni friends because I’ve known her longer. Additionally, I had invited her to come down but she says it’s too expensive. 
- Another example of this was we were at a festival, which we paid a lot to go to, and she was moody a good 75% of the time, because me and her friend were getting along really well. 
- She seems to just use me when she needs me. In the past she wanted me to go out with her drinking, and she was going with one of her friends and her boyfriend. Now I don’t really know these people, I’m more introverted and they just weren’t my type of group so I said I didn’t want to go. She was then getting annoyed saying I was boring, when she had already asked other people to go, and furthermore was only using me since one of her parents didn’t want her to go alone otherwise she would have to come back earlier. This annoyed me because many times at a drop of a hat, I’ve gotten ready and gone to parties with her, ones where I know no-one and she goes off with someone, leaving me surrounded by people I don’t know. 
- More recently my pet passed away, and she said how it hadn’t had a very good life. Somehow I managed to stay calm and collected but this really hurt me. My pet was always a lot calmer than the ones she has, and whilst she doesn’t know we had to have him put down, I told her he wasn’t very well. For some reason she took that as some sort of joke and decided to say that. 
- Then what caused us to argue was I was back home and for two weeks I hadn’t been very well. We had planned to go out for food and drinking on the night (with her other friend as well). I had gotten ready for it and I messaged saying how I wouldn’t be drinking and I might go home after food. I didn’t really want alcohol since my head was already hurting and she she called me boring twice for it. To which I just said I wasn’t going anymore. 
- One year for my birthday, when we were still close she didn’t have much money so she didn’t get me a present which was completely fine. But she also didn’t even get me a card or try to do something nice considering how long and how good of friends we were. 

From there we argued over message for a while and she was saying how I need to lighten up. Perhaps I shouldn’t have kept in how I was feeling for so long but I don’t really like confrontation and I felt like it was easier just to let things go. Anyway, after a long long argument she said how she didn’t want to lose me as a friend and that she was sorry for anything she might have said. These things may sound really bad but I haven’t mentioned that we did use to get along very well but even before I moved away I was getting tired of how she was. 

Now we are on speaking terms and I feel like I’m doing it for her sake. As in when I think about it, I don’t think about us getting along like we used to, rather she has another friend that she can go to. It’s hard to explain. I guess I just wanted other opinions, my friends think I should drop her and my partner thinks that maybe I should give her another chance. 

I do appreciate her apology and she is wanting us to meet up after isolation but part of me honestly just doesn’t want to and the other part feels like I should"
"I want to move out, here’s why, but my question is how? So disclaimer, this is my first post on reddit. Not entirely sure if I’m doing this right, or if this is the right place to post this question. 

Background: I was adopted 3 years ago (I’m 18 now), and I’ve lived with my adopted family for 5 years now. I’ve got 10 siblings, 6 gained through the adoption. When my bio sister was born, I started being the caregiver for any and everyone in whatever house we were in. (Kids go into foster care for a reason) I learned extreme independence from a young age so it was difficult to adjust to my family being so willing to help me in just about anything. (It’s been a constant struggle between my parents and I for the past 5 years)

So recently, I’ve started “adulting” more and more. I have my drivers and motorcycle license, two “real” jobs since turning 16 (there was a 4 month overlap between the two), I pay my own insurance on both vehicles, bought my car from my dad, etc. I’ve been on my parents phone plan since I got a phone but our service provider sucks where we live and my boss told me I had to get different service, so I did. So now I have another bill, it’s fine it was gonna happen eventually, but my parents are just constantly getting on my ass for various stupid things, “adulting” things. The phone included. 

Before COVID-19, I went to school 9-3 (senior half days yay), then went home, napped, then got up to go to work 10-3a. It’s an hour drive to the site, so wake up at 8, leave by 9 at the latest, get home by 4 if I’m lucky. Then do it all over again. The problem was insomnia and homework. A max of 4 hours of sleep before school and 5 before work, if I could fall asleep and IF I didn’t care about my hw. But then my parents would chew my ass for not cleaning house, not being “social” enough, etc.  So I’d have to choose between sleep and other obligations (very tired for several months) and sometimes I didn’t even have a choice one way or the other. 

Now, during the COVID, my work hours have shifted a little, 5-11, more hours a day just less days a week than before. But I still have homework to do, still have to fit in the family obligations, and I STILL have insomnia. (It’s 5am rn and I’ve had it for years now, taking meds for it either doesn’t work or works too well). And honestly if this was all that was bothering me, I wouldn’t be asking you lovely people. The thing is, my older (adoptive) brother still lives at home (he’s 23), works at the same job I do, but he does literally NOTHING. He works, he sleeps and eats, and he’s out of the house as much as possible, but if I need to do something out of the house, or even if I go with the aforementioned brother, they lose their minds with me. Two days ago, I was basically pulled out of my bed and dragged into the kitchen to be yelled at profusely by my parents for going somewhere with my brother, after I told them where we were going and blah blah blah. My mom scream/yell/told me if I’m going to keep “behaving” like this then I might as well just fucking move out already. 

I want to. 

I can’t. 

I don’t make enough monthly to afford to move out and continue paying the bills I already have. 

So basically my question is, what do I do? Move out or just keep dealing with my family? Do I even have a choice given the virus?"
"Just found out that my bf of almost 5 years has a history of sleeping with his older half sister... The title is what it is... I(F21) found out accidentally by going on his(M24) phone's notes while he went away to the restroom. I had intentions of typing out a cute little note that I wanted him to find later but I ended up finding a list of other females he has had sex with and his sister what a part of the list... 

A little history on what I know about my bf's sister... She is about the age of 26 or 27 by now? She grew up in California while my bf grew up in the Philippines due to them having two different moms and with that said, they have always stayed in separate homes only seeing eachother during family meet up trips. My bf has only met his half sister a few times in his childhood and maybe 3-4 times as a teenager. The last time my bf saw his sister was when he was 18 and she was 20 I believe. 

I confronted him about it twice and the first time I asked him nicely and respectfully without prying too much and he tried to make up an excuse that he ""accidentally"" put her on the list but I wasn't buying that and after two days of losing sleep trying to convince myself that it really wasn't an accident, I confronted him the 2nd time and thats when I pushed the issue. After expressing my frustration to him he finally came clean and admitted to having sex with her in his past. 

I didn't bother to ask for anymore details. I honestly felt like I was going to throw up... I have not been able to get much sleep the past few days. I really don't know how to feel or what to do... I am just disgusted at the fact that they both knew what they were doing and mostly at the fact that his sister is older than him... shouldn't she have known better?? 

I don't even know for how long that kind of a relationship between the two of them had been going on for... I know him and his sister haven't spoken for a long time. I wouldn't be surprised if the last time they spoke was the last time they were intimate. Out of the 4 and a half years i've been with my bf, I have never even met or spoken to his sister. 

I love my bf very much. He is the most kind and respectful man I have ever met. We have had a great relationship and I have always looked forward to my future with him but i'm truthfully not sure if I could go on knowing this info about him. Is this a huge red flag? Is this something worth breaking up over? Does anyone have a similar experience to this where it still worked out in the end? What do I say to him? He has been calling since the last time we spoke but i've just been ignoring them bc I don't know what to say... 

TL;DR: 
I(F21) found out that my bf(M24) slept with his half blood sister whom he did not grow up with due to having different moms and living in separate homes. The last time he had contact with his sister was when he was 18 and she was 20. I am not sure how long they've had an intimate relationship, I only know that they have had sex before. IDK what to say to him or do... but I do know that I love him very much but i'm having a hard time overlooking this situation.

EDIT: Also, if I were to continue my relationship with my bf... What do I do if his sister was ever brought back into the picture?... Does this situation make it okay for me to tell him that I am not comfortable with him ever contacting his half sister again? I can't help but feel like if I were to ever meet his sister irl I would have so many urges to strangle her with my bare hands..."
"I love my gf, but i’m afraid maybe she isnt “the one” Me M28, my gf F28. I love her a lot we’ve been together for many years now. But i’m starting to see some of the things she is/does and how it bothers me and idk what to think or feel at this point.

The best i can tell it comes down to screen time addiction, maybe some laziness too. And i can’t fault her for that because i love video games and play the hell out of them too. I’m also quite lazy on sundays, sometimes saturdays when i’m off work. but I also understand when its time to stop gaming, stop being lazy, and handle your chores....

My house is old as dirt (built 50 years ago) but I work some everyday to keep it clean and tidy. Caught up on dishes and laundry and etc. i always do my chores first and treat video games as a reward for getting everything done...

Her house ,however, is new, built within the last 10 years and its a freaking disaster..... Dinner from one day might get left on the counter for a week before its cleaned up and dishes washed.... i can barely walk from the living room to the bathroom, or any bedroom without stepping on dirty laundry, its all over the bathroom and bedroom floors... and thats just her, then there is her kids who had a toy explosion in the entire house.....

I’ve tried to work with her before. Her mom took her kids on vacation, so i suggested to her we take the time to pick up all the toys, dispose of all the old disgusting food, do all the dishes, and all the laundry....She lasted about 2.5 hours into cleaning and she was ready to quit, with the house half a dump still... I kept trucking with or without her help, and managed to get the house done. And within 2 days of them coming back from vacation is was completely wrecked again.... all that work gone to waste....

Maybe part of that is just her being lazy. But to the point about screen time.... She’s majorly involved in these Harry Potter fan groups on FB... she’s a moderator and seems to take her FB moderator responsibilities more seriously than her real life responsibilities.....

When we’re cleaning, every-time i turn around she’s dropped whats she’s doing and has her face in the phone. She’s bitched and complained that her kids shout and scream unnecessarily, which they do, but i’ve seen them come to her and ask her politely something 3-4 times and she completely blows them off and ignored them if she’s got her face in a phone or game. They literally have to shout loud enough to break her attention away from the harry potter fan chat for her to respond in any way, and often times she responds negatively for them shouting at her....

And i’ve mentioned this to her. I told her about it and how it bothers me. She said ok she’ll try to do better about staying off the phone, but it seems to only matter when it suites her.... She gets impatient, to the point of being mad at me, if i don’t drop my laundry or dishes or whatever chore i’m doing and respond to her immediately.... But if we lay down to relax and get ready for bed at night........ i’m not even supposed to even have my phone in my hands.... She demands all attention be paid to her....

She could be on the phone all day long. Even when i try and take her out to dinner on date nights.... the whole time i drive there. And the whole time i drive back, i might as well be driving alone because she’s into that phone and i cant even converse with her....

I’m sorry for the book of a post. If you made it this far you’re an honest to god trooper. Sorry for troubling you with my own personal troubles."
"Boyfriend reluctant to move the relationship forward :( Sorry for the long post! 

My boyfriend (22) and I (21) have been dating for 4 years now, and around a year and a half ago we were both working full time jobs with relatively good pay (for our age) and I suggested we should move in together. At first he said we would move in later in the year and we should focus on saving for our upcoming holidays (we both lived with our parents still so saving was pretty easy without having to pay rent). I agreed yet as the year went by he kept on putting off moving in together, like let's wait until after Christmas and after another holiday in January and I eventually put my foot down and said we were going to look for places after the holiday, and he agreed

While I was happy to look for a place to live he seemed reluctant, even though he told me he was looking he never suggested any places and I felt like it was always me finding places to look at, most of which he would veto for not being in a nice enough area (fair enough, there is some dodgy places around here), and eventually we found a place we both liked and moved into.

Now here's the thing

Recently I started to approach the idea of getting engaged, and he straight up shot me down saying he wanted to wait a few more years (as in late 20s) before even thinking about getting engaged. He then proceeded to tell me he didn't even want to move in with me and he was so upset when it actually happened (the entire moving process he was telling me he was looking forward to moving in with me) and that he was afraid of missing his parents when he moved in with me, but now he's happy and likes living with me but still isn't even thinking about moving things any further

While I'm not desperate to get engaged instantly or even in a year or so, I would like to know that he's at least thinking about it, or if he even wants to. It hurts my feelings a bit that after 3 years together he was so reluctant to move out of his parents house which to me seems normal at our age, and after 4 years together he's not even thinking about engagement. But I love him so much, life without him seems unbearable and we just click together so well sometimes it's like we're the same person, he understands my weirdness in a way that most other people do not and he's always telling me I mean so much to him and aside from us wanting different things our relationship is great. I just can't seem to help wanting the relationship to move forward and he seems content with the way the relationship was back when we saw each other maybe twice a week and still lived with our parents, spending all the money we earned on crap we didn't really need. 

Am I just over thinking things and we're both still so young that I shouldn't worry, I don't mind waiting, or is this indicative of a larger problem that could affect us later in life?"
"Should I be helping my sister or myself, or something else? I (16f) live with my mom (late 40s) and sister (11f). My parents are divorced and both my sister and I have lived with my mother for virtually all the time since that happened.

The way that my mother and sister act makes me hate a significant portion of the time they are awake. My sister is home schooled and also does sports. Since this pandemic my mom has been doing even more with my sister. My sister seems to really hate my mom's instructions and often throws fits and yells. On occasion she hits my mother or similar. Sometimes my mom hits her back. (Is this justified?) They can yell for hours on end. Yesterday, for example, I was going to get up at 10am, however they were screaming. I then slept and tried to get up a few more times, until the late afternoon when they finally stopped.

Their constantly annoying and stupid behaviour has made has made it often hard for me get work done. (I get motivated and work and then they decide to scream for a while.) When they are screaming and hurting each other oftentimes they will come into my room, where I work on schoolwork, to whine about the other. I usually try to get them to go out but it often takes a bit of time. My sister also sometimes runs into my closet to get away from my mom.

I really don't know what to do with all of this occuring everyday. I have adapted to their screaming and it distracts me less than it used to but it is still pretty hard. The earbuds that I used to use have also stopped working, so I cannot listen to music while they have their yelling contests.

I wish I could go to my dad, but that cannot happen. I have ruined that relationship for a good while. (I went to his house after my mom and sister were being annoying enough for me to not want to be there. My mom found out I wanted to leave and was packing my bags, and said I was leaving for good, and anything I didn't take would be given to my sister or charity. Apparently she felt bad the next day.) Essentially his girlfriend was unhappy that I would not fold his clothes, including underwear, that was in the same load of laundry as mine was. She basically said shame on you and that I should see why I was wrong. My dad said originally just to not worry about it. I got pretty distraught about this and cried. They told me to try and understand what I did. I honestly tried. I then got more upset and ended up calling them names. My dad said I had to leave and go to my mother's or he would call the police (for god knows what). So the I left and went back with my mother.

I don't know what I should be doing. I feel like I should try to help my sister, but she has been both nice and pretty hurtful. Sometimes she likes to just chat with me, but she has on occasion hit me in the ribs with a broomstick, for example. I feel like I cannot protect her. She hurts my mother (who at this point do not care about too much) but is also hurt by my mother. I cannot leave this place unless I want to be homeless.

What should I be doing and is there anything you think I can do to improve this situation? I also want to make the situation better for myself, if possible. "
"Emotionally Abusive ex gf (22F) text me recognising the abuse and apologised. Now wants me (21M) back ? I posted a few days ago about this and have copied some of the text in below. The general point 4 days on from the post below is that she did the first time recognised the abuse and apologised saying she knows she was being crazy and regretted all of it. She says she is so full of regret and wishes she wasn’t so cold when dumping me and realised that it was her causing most of the issues because she wasn’t in a good headspace. I’ve told her I need time but she has met this with some sadness. 

She has said she wishes she could change her actions but can’t and has really improved herself over the last 5 Months. She said she’d literally do anything for me back and that she hadn’t been treated the way she had with me with anyone else. She has previously moved on quickly from relationships but she says she can’t move in from me.

Problem is now that I do really miss her but I’m scared things will go back to the way they are. However I have never seen her so accepting of her role in the relationship and willingness to get us back. She said she’d wait however long it took for me to feel ready. And if not then she hopes I’m happy in myself. 

I just don’t know if she would have changed. 

Below is the previous post for a summary of the relationship: 


My girlfriend broke up with me at the end of November. We had met at University and got together in the second year.

We had been together 2 years and lived together in her hometown until I was dumped in November. 

We had constant arguments and made each other upset. I would quite often come back from long shifts at work and end up crying at 2am because of how I felt in the relationship. If I tried to talk to her about it I was met with ‘sort your self out and prioritise me and the relationship will be better’. She never accepted responsibility for anything. 

The day after my grandfathers funeral I returned from Ireland but had forgotten my key to the flat as I left I’m such a rush to get out to Ireland in the first place. I rang her saying I’d forgot my keys as she said she’ll be in but she wasn’t and she had accidentally left the wrong key under the mat and was extremely pissed off on her return, ignoring me and calling me a cunt and all other names under the sun. The thing is I still felt bad like I should have been better and I tried to cater to her to make her feel better.

There were other examples of her throwing my shoes out the window and smashing a small mirror on the floor when she was upset but those were probably the most extreme. A lot of days would be an argument and end in her blanking me or shouting every word under the sun to me.

I begged for her back 3 days after she broke up with me but she was cold and said I was being manipulative and making her feel guilty. That’s when I gave up. She told me to love my stuff out and ‘by 5 if I could’ because she had a client coming round. And she refused to help me move my stuff - I was broken.

We were meant to go New York 3 weeks later but she ended up going with her parents - she started saying she wished I was there but all this came after I stopped talking to her and let her be. 

Things picked duo in January and she started saying she wanted me back and had made an awful mistake. I felt to crap by that time and I felt there was no way back. 

She contacts me to this day, she blocks me on social media and then contacts me a different day. She accused me of cheating on her during the relationship the other day (not true btw) and then when I reply denying it she starts talking to me as normal saying she misses me. 

I don’t know what to do anymore.

She called me yesterday saying she’s sorry and she had changed and she admitted all her mistakes. She says she can’t keep messaging me and having me reject her all the time.

She does sound genuinely upset and I am a bot worried about her welfare because she has suffered with mental health a lot previously and self harmed a long time ago. She is very intelligent and has a lot going for her but I’m struggling with what to do now.

She says to me ‘are you okay with never seeing me again?’obviously this is the worst part of the breakup but I don’t know what to say, of course I miss her but I was so not myself in the relationship. She keep mentioning these points of great happiness we had in the relationship and says that I just focus on the negative.

She says by not wanting her or giving her a second chance i am showing I didn’t care about the relationship. She’s now saying that she wants me part of her life even as a friend but I’m not so sure that’s the motive.

I did love her a hell of a lot and out you with perhaps more than I should have, although I know relationships are two way things and I have to also take responsibility. I feel bad I miss her but also am not sure if the right thing to do is get back with her. 


Edit: She messaged me just now pouring her heart out at all the things she misses about me and all the things she now knows she took for granted and wishes she could have again even ‘for one more day’. She does have a nice side to her I know that and she said to me that she doesn’t even recognise who she was in ye relationship and regrets it all. Anyway, the message was massive, I’ve never seen her do something like that, it’s funny because the tables have completely turned and she is now begging for me to come back. But I feel bad, there is still a hope somewhere deep down that she will be different and it could be a good relationship but so much has happened verbally/ emotionally to me tht I don’t know how it could ever go back. She’s also slept with someone else a month after she broke up with me and also stayed at his 2 weeks after we broke up - I’m not stupid but maybe my ego gets in the way but this is the main thing stopping me from going back. When perhaps I should ignore it and look at everything else that happened which was perhaps far worse. 

I will say she seems genuinely broken and with previous boyfriends she has moved in pretty quickly. We did have a strong bond and I think deep down she’s a good person and doesn’t mean to be how she is in a lot of ways.

I would really appreciate advice on this, she says she’s changed in 5 months and realised what she lost but I’m just not sure 

Thank you"
"[TRIGGER WARNING] My friend (27F) wants me (28F) to forgive the men who sexually assaulted us. How do I explain that I cannot do this? When my friend, Rachel, and I were in our early 20s we went to a house party that consisted of about 10 of our friends who were all around the same age as us. Eventually the party moved out back to the fire pit and this is when 2 guys in their 30s show up. They worked with the guy who was throwing the party and had decided to crash it. Our friend was not ok with this as they were at least 15 years older than everyone there and stone cold sober while the rest of us were drunk. They were making everyone really uncomfortable so our friend made them leave. 

At this point it was around 2 am and Rachel is absolutely trashed. I was drunk too but nowhere near as bad so I decided it was time to help Rachel to bed in the spare room we had claimed for ourselves earlier. As we were making our way through the house I saw the 2 guys from earlier come back in but I ignored them and just focused on getting Rachel to bed since she was passing out.

The moment we got into the spare room the 2 guys pushed in after us and shoved Rachel onto the bed and me onto the floor. I was pinned down and sexually assaulted while forced to watch my blacked out friend be raped. 

The two men were later arrested and received lengthy sentences as it turns out it was not their first offense. 

Fast forward to earlier this week and Rachel has decided that she needs to forgive these men to be able to heal and she needs my forgiveness for them as well. She said because it happened to both of us, she wants us to go on this healing journey together. This is driven by Rachel finding religion earlier this year while I remain strictly agnostic. 

I tried explaining to her that while I have accepted what happened to us, I will never be able to forgive the men that did it. Rachel was injured during the attack however she does not remember any of it happening. I on the other hand remember every single detail of the assault  not only on myself but also her. She says that because she was the one actually raped and is able to forgive the man who did it then I should be able to as well. The thing is I had actually already been violently raped 2 years prior to this incident so being forced to watch it happen to her was like reliving my own previous trauma on top of being newly assaulted. All of this I have explained to her but she just says that she is sorry all of this hate inside of me will keep me prisoner from living a healthy and happy life. 

I am so fucking angry at her. She won’t listen and just keeps using religion as her argument against me. This is a girl I grew up with and the trauma we shared brought us even closer together. Now I feel myself starting to hate her and I don’t know if I just need to let her go or if there’s something I can say that might save the friendship that means so much to me. I’m heartbroken and angry and I just need some outside perspective because I feel like my emotions are getting the best of me.

Edit: I am reading every single comment even though I cannot respond to them all. You guys are wonderful and I appreciate you commenting more than you can imagine. I’m not responding to many comments because my hands are shaking really bad and I’m crying like a baby. Posting this was harder than I thought it would be and I didn’t expect to react to it the way I am, but it also feels like a huge relief getting it off my chest. You guys are giving me a lot to think about and helping me feel so much less alone. Thank you a million times."
"My (29M) girlfriend (32F) cracked up and cried when we spoke about sex. Can I ask about her former boyfriends? Hey pals,  
a couple of days ago I met my girlfriend at her house and after two weeks without sex I was expecting that she was horny but just the opposite, she was tired and she didn't feel like to have sex so I cuddled her as I always do.  
After just 6 months of relationship I thought two people in love would like to have sex often so honestly I felt rejected (as her lack of desire was a lack of love) but I didn't put pressure on her, as I always do.   
Anyway, the next morning we spoke about it (I was a bit pissed the day before but that morning I was really calm and I wanted just communicate my feelings to improve our relationship) and at one point she started to crack up crying (loudy, almost hysterical) for 5 minutes telling me that she is tired that people tell her what to do or how she should be or when to have sex, etc (note that I never pressured her to have sex) but my sensation was that she was more stressed and angry more about her past than with me.    
Honestly I was quite shocked and I'm worried that this problem can brings future problems in our relationship.  
I'm quite sure her emotional collapse is due to her past relationship (one time she told me that her former boyfriend wanted to have sex even when she didn't feel like it).  
The problem is that I'm the communicative part of the couple and she often is not so much communicative so I don't know how to approach this situation.  
  
  
&amp;nbsp;  

Do you think I can ask her what were the problems with her former boyfriends and why they broke up?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  

Thanks!"
"Boyfriend put me down after I said I want surgery So I had a convo w my BF, told him that since he has 2 kids and I have 1, that I don't want any more; if I do in the future, I'll just adopt. After this mutual agreement, I also told him that I would be getting a tummy tuck once covid is over and he said ""you're too old, that's for younger people, ( while laughing saying what am I in Hollywood) you're so frugal yet are quick to spend 1000's of $$$'s on your body and let’s not forget your braces cost a lot too, you’re very superficial; what’s the point of doing all of that. You have never even spent more than 100 dollars on me"". I'm 32. I'm frugal bc I've been saving for a house and at the same time saving for my surgery. It hurt my feelings and I cried bc I'm not a superficial person but I've wanted to do this for a while just never had enough $ and motivation within me. It's always been an insecurity of mine and I just want to feel better about myself, same with my braces. I've never been one to let others bring me down but this certainly did, made me feel like I am old, even though I've heard opposite. Just wanted to get that off my chest and perhaps words of encouragement. Thanks for listening.

Edit: thank you all for your kind, encouraging words. If I had no one in the world, I’d be alright bc I got reddit. I am reflecting on a lot and realizing that I can’t let him treat me this way. I need to stop making excuses for him and do what’s best for my mental health. I do love him and wish he’d think about stuff before he said them but I feel like this is who he is and I can’t change that and am exhausted trying to better him. Again thank you all so much, you have lifted me up when my heart was feeling so sad 💜"
"18 year old in deep love with a 40 year old I 18M have been in a relationship with a 40F. Me and her share a connection that I can’t compare any other relationships to. The way we are able to understand each other and it feels like we are to each other exactly what the other needs. 

If she was my age I could so confidently say that we would have a magical relationship.

The problem is that we’re not the same age and the huge gap comes complications. I’m looking for advice and other people’s opinion of what to do and how to deal with this.

The first complication is the fear of judgement from others. Both of us struggle with what our families and friends who think of us. However this is probably the smallest complication and can both easily get over it 

The harder and more complicated things leave me torn on what to do. A lot of these things come off super bad and I feel like an asshole for worrying about it.

She has been not able to 100% decide if she would want children with me. She already has 2 children that are my age and is unsure if she wants more. I want children and it is a really big deal for me.

She is unsure about getting re married. She was married for over 20 years in her previous marriage 

This seems so superficial but I worry about losing attraction to her as she gets older. No looks could come between the deep feelings I have for her and I would always love her deeply but in say 20 years I don’t know if I would be physically Or sexually attracted to her still

Losing her while I and maybe kids are still young. Looking at things and being realistic in all likelihood I would out live her by a decent bit. I honestly don’t know how I would ever deal with this. Obviously this could happen in any relationship but it feels like I’m setting myself up for a huge world of hurt one day. The amount of hurt aside I’m unsure how i would move on in life
after"
"My (24M) girlfriend (22F) wants to buy a house together. I’m financially stable and she’s not. We’ve been dating for ~1.5 years. I’m in a financially stable, well-payed job with savings to afford a house. She has 2 more years of university left (not payed) and minimal savings. 

Several times she’s talked about us buying our first house together. I’ve always wanted my first house to be my own. Plus, I don’t feel comfortable buying a house together when I’m financially able but she’s not and she won’t be for a few years. Every time the discussion ends with me telling her this and her in floods of tears. But this just leaves me thinking do I want to live with her at all/is there a future?

Am I wrong for my thinking on this? Is there a way that I can better navigate this issue when she next brings it up?"
"I need help forgetting my past &amp; moving on from an only relationship. As a kid I was poorly treated and went through one of the worst divorces ever. I barely came out ok, and I was physically &amp; mentally unhealthy. After things began to die down I was about 12, and middle school was worse. I was bullied and traumatized even more than I had already been in my abusive relationship with my parents. My trust &amp; faith had been ruined.

Fast forward to high school, and I meet a girl. She was amazing and sweet and we both played the same sport. We dated for about 2 years while I still dealt with many of my problems that I tended to ignore. She broke up with me on my birthday, and I was really really broken. I realized that I was broken from the beginning and shouldn’t have gotten into a relationship unless I was ok. I was building this sanctuary in someone else before myself, and I was the desolate land of nuclear war. 

It has now been a year, and I haven’t really dated anyone, but I still feel incredibly broken, and I just don’t know what I can do to get better. I’m constantly doing things to try to help but noting works. My subconscious mind has been the worst part, as soon as I think i’m over it, I have a dream about her. And just yesterday I saw her, and it broke me even more. I don’t know what to do, but every-time I see her car model, I always get nervous, or I’m always thinking of ways to make her jealous or think that she regretted it. If any of this helps: I’m a gemini &amp; am INFJ.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Anything."

"Fiance's not a fan of my tattoos and doesn't want me to get more Hello reddit,

Just as the title says my fiance doesn't like my current tattoos and wishes I don't get anymore. I'm sure as anyone with tattoos knows, once you get one, you usually want more. And after I got my first one a year ago (while we were together) I've had the urge to get tons more and I planned out which ones where. My fiance, though, is not a fan of tattoos. And shes told me several times to not get one. Is there any way I could convince her? Or should I just drop it?"
"My (24F) highschool friend (23F) has once again put herself in a position that endangers the children she still has custody of. So, I've been casual friends with this girl we will call Sasha since middle school. 

She's always been balls to the wall crazy. She once was suspended for cutting ""do you see me now mom?"" Into her belly and showing everyone at school. 

Fast forward, and she has a little boy with a crappy man. She eventually leaves him, and works her ass off to keep her son and meet his needs. 

Doing great right? 

Well, her ex decided to get married to a new woman and have a child. She loves being a mom and encouraged him to fight for custody of his son, who's now about 5. 

That was the last I heard from her, until recently.

Unfortunately, Sasha has met a new man we'll call ""ASS HAT"" because that's what he is, honestly. 

Sasha got pregnant with one of ass hats children. 

This man kicked her out, beat her, cheats on her and emotionally abuses her and her son. 

He ex got full custody, which destroyed Sasha as she obviously missed her son. 

Since then, it's been a rollercoaster of her and ass hat breaking up and getting back together. She's pregnant with his third child, as he Refused to use protection and she can't use BC due to some health problems. 

She has had multiple miscarriages, and he just yells at her saying her body isn't good enough to carry his child. 

She miscarriages BECAUSE he stresses her out and BEATS HER. Her last miscarriage was because he pushed off his balcony, IN FRONT OF HER CHILD.

He even kicked her out for miscarrying, saying she was not a real woman. 

She stayed in a motel, because her adopted parents have disowned her. She does not know her real parents.

When she wasn't pregnant she was working as a stripper to pay for her childrens needs as Ass Hat refuses to contribute. 

He saw her at the local club and invited her back, unfortunately for her 

She is pregnant again and it's been complicated but so far the baby is alive. She doesn't seem to understand that fist fighting her boyfriend, him not contributing or supporting her is wrong. 

She even admitted that she has to get pregnant to be able to stay with him, because he ""loves her more"" when she's pregnant. 

She ""fearS"" asking him these things will make him leave her again. 

I've told her countless times these are all red flags and not normal behavior in a healthy relationship and her children and her deserve better but she doesn't care. 

She goes right back to him, and has the mentality it's her job to feed him, fuck him, wash him, and basically be his cum dumpster/ brainless 20s era house wife. 

She even jabs at me when I let my husband cook or do things ""women should do"" and I feel like it's Ass Hats manipulating her because she was never like this before she met him. She was very pro woman and independent.

I know I can't make her see reason. She is trapped in her own world with Ass Hat. 

But her children deserve better..they don't deserve to see their mom abused or be abused themselves. 

She even prides herself on the fact she can ""vent"" to her 4 year old son because he listens to her and says he will protect his mommy. He's so innocent but exposed to so much.

I saw her post yesterday on FB asking for diapers for her youngest because Ass Hat won't buy more and she can't afford any because her work is closed. She also made the statement that she can't keep reusing the diapers which made me so upset. 

I bought her a package of course with a few things for her other kids, and Ass Hat promptly kicked me out for ""enabling her"". 

Her kids are sad, and dirty and wearing clothes way to small. Sasha admitted to me that only Ass Hat is currently allowed to shower there, as she recently cleaned the bathroom and he didn't want any of them making everything dirty. 

They both are less then 4 years old. 


TL:DR my friend won't see reason and her children are stuck in her abusive cross fire."
"I want to respect my friend, but... My friend and I text every day. We talking about philosophy, we share what music we're listening to, etc. I've really become used to the correspondence and I care for him deeply. It's become a very valuable part of my life.

Five days ago, he told me he had other matters to deal with and asked if I could leave him alone for a while. Of course, I obliged. Totally reasonable request. I told him to let me know when I was welcome back. 

It's now been five days, and I still haven't heard anything. The messaging app says hes been online throughout the days, so I know hes alive, but I hear nothing. I dont want to push him if he just doesnt want to talk to me, but I miss him and havent been given any explanation. How long do I wait before checking in?"
"My boyfriend (20M) replied to a message his female best friend (21F) sent him when I (21F) was giving him a bj We’ve been dating two years and throughout this time he’s had a female best friend. I’m fine with this as men and women can obviously be platonic friends. This girl is also my friend too. I don’t think anything’s going on with them however they do spend time alone together which I’m not entirely comfortable with.

So we were having sex and when I was giving him a blowjob I noticed he had picked up his phone and was typing. I thought he was filming me without my permission (which would be bad) but no, it was worse, he was texting his female best friend. This was a kick in the teeth, tbh. I was so hurt after it. I instantly got a bad feeling in my stomach and stopped and he actually had the audacity to ask why. Why the hell do you think? Do I not deserve your full concentration? I’m not sure what to do anymore as I always thought their relationship was platonic but now that I think about it, I’ve never been fine with him hanging out privately with her. Any time he mentions her I freeze as I’m not fine with their friendship, and this has just made me feel a whole lot worse with it. I think he knows that now. 

Do you think there’s something going on between them or do you think this was a momentary lapse in judgement for him?"
"How do you reason with an emotionally immature partner? Title basically says it all...

My girlfriend (23) and I (m, 27) live together and as we  go through adjusting to living with one another while also continuing to develop our relationship I am seeing  her become increasingly emotionally immature. 

She is...

- very easily offended (ex: we go to bed and she wants to cuddle but I am not in the mood, she rolls over to the other side of the bed and pouts about it)

- she twists my words (ex: I told her that our relationship has started to feel like we are just going through the motions and I want to bring the excitement back. She responds “so you’re just bored with me and un attracted to me now?” She then gets upset even though that is not what I said nor is it what I meant)

- she reacts solely from her emotions when she is upset. She doesn’t pause and take a moment to evaluate her feeling and then decide how to react. these reactions can often be volatile. 

- she likes to play the victim. thinks that I’m purposely trying to slight her or offend her. 

- she turns conversations into arguments. as soon as I say something in a talk that she doesn’t like, her tone of voice and pitch change and she gets on the defense. Starts listing things I’ve done wrong in the past. 

I’m know I’m not perfect. And over the years I’ve done an incredible amount of my own personal work and self growth to get to where I am now, but I’m not sure I can continue to be with her anymore. The difference in emotional and mental maturity are becoming more and more clear to me as time goes on. 

Does anyone have ANY advice for how to handle this for the time being? How do you reason with an emotionally immature partner?

Thanks for reading."
"Am I wrong for breaking up with my BF for cheating when he didn’t ACTUALLY cheat? So I (18M) have been dating this guy, we’ll call him Josh (20M), for about 4 months.  Quarantine has been hard on us both, so we’ve been facetiming, snapchatting, and texting whenever we got the chance.  I felt really comfortable with him within a week into the relationship.  So a week before the incident, I decided to tell him I loved him, which ended up going great. 

So a couple days ago some guy I don’t know adds me on snapchat.  When I added him, he left me a ton of messages that were really kind of out there.  We’ll call him Nick.  Nick said that Josh had asked him to hookup with him about a month ago, but he had said no.  He then asked the day I received these messages if he would go over to his place to hookup, with another rejection coming from Nick.  

I confronted Josh about this and he was very upfront with me.  No bullshit, he owned up to it.  While I appreciated the honesty, I still felt hurt, unwanted, and embarrassed because I thought that I wasn’t good enough.  Josh argued that it didn’t count as cheating because he “knew that Nick wouldn’t come over” and that I was blowing this out of proportions.  He says that he still loves me and has changed/learned from this experience.  We argued for maybe 30 minutes before I just stopped responding.  He has been calling and messaging me nonstop since the argument.  

Up until I found this out, he has been nothing short of amazing to me.  He’s been there to listen to my problems, joke around, and just have fun together.  We were practically inseparable.  

So what I want to know is, am I wrong for not giving him a second chance and completely writing off our strong relationship?  I don’t know if i was too quick to break it off.

IMPORTANT INFO:  I learned that this guy has had a “toxic hold” on Josh for about 2 years, so the two of them have had a history and have hooked up in the past.  Nick had been playing mind games with Josh in the past, but he didn’t dive too deep into the specifics while we were dating."
"My girlfriend (21F) goes to her friends whenever we have an argument. Obviously her friends always side with her, she then comes to me and tells me to apologize if it’s not my fault. (20M) I can’t think of a single argument I’ve had with my girlfriend that she hasn’t told her friend about.

Literally every time there is an argument, she goes straight to her friends (usually her two best friends or dad) and talks to them about it.

She won’t talk to me about it. So then she’ll hear her friends who always side with her, comes back and says I need to apologize for x y and z because that what her friends think is wrong.

I fucking hate this more then anything. She doesn’t handle arguments well, and I asked her to stop telling her friends but she says she doesn’t handle “arguments well” and usually cries pretty easily so she goes to friends.

It paints a bad picture for me because her friends think I’m just some chump who always gets in fights that are my fault, and it also pisses my off that it always sways the story your way and makes it seem like she never has to apologize.

I asked her to stop but she said she won’t. She said it’s how she copes.

We’ve been dating for a year and 2 months now.

TL;DR girlfriend tells her friends every argument we have. No privacy in our relationship."
"I (20M) can't forget her (20F). So I kind of recently had a break up, like 3-4 months ago and I just can't forget her idk why.

We were in a relationship for 2 yrs and things were going really good. We were having a good time, enjoying ourselves and all.
After that 2 years she joined a company and was going really busy which had me kind of pissed and annoyed. I sometimes get frustrated without any reason, I mean the reason was pretty obvious (me not getting attention).
So our communication was lost and we were arguing a lot and then we both mutually decided that we should break up.
After 2-3 months, I talked to her because I wanted to know how she was doing in this lockdown and if she's okay amd stuff.

She asked me if I had a girlfriend or not, I replied in negative, I asked the same to her and got to know that she was seeing a guy (which honestly made me sad and my mood was pretty shitty after that).

I am kind of a loner with not that many friends and also during this lockdown I'm stuck and can't do anything but overthink sometimes.

I just need some advice that how can I stop being upset and how can I erase my memories (if they could be, as I have no intention of getting back with her and I'm happy, just the ""THOUGHTS"")"
"I miss my ex like i miss opiates? What do i do? Me and my girlfriend of 5 years recently broke up im pretty sure its for good. Let me give ya a little back story so we started dating and we were good for the first year and this is before i started my opiate addiction. She would break up w me randomly then by the time i got to the door to leave she would be crying to take her back and obviously i would. But I was very insecure in the beginning because my previous relationship i put my all in and got fucked over and cheated on so my guard has always been up and its been really hard for me to let it down and fully give my all to someone else cause of the fear of getting fucked over again.

 so i was always tripping on dudes that would look at her and would try starting fights w dudes over it.( obviously very immature thing to do but i was 17 at the time) So this continued for a couple months of her trying to break up with me then before i could walk out she would cry and tell me not to leave , so that fucked with my head alot like do you want me to leave or not? And a little after the first year she saw a picture that some girl sent me and she left me and i got really heavy into doing cocaine and drinking to numb out my emotions and feelings of thinking about her. But we stayed in contact and got back together about 3 months after and it was never the same, she would never trust me and shes completely warranted  to it.

 I never told her i was doing cocaine so the little lies started building of ""i dont do drugs"" and for the longest time she didnt know i was doing drugs. Shes a straight laced never touched drugs rarely ever drinks,never gets introuble and im the first guy shes ever been with. So i would lie about doing drugs because in my mind i didnt want to hurt her and was protecting her from the truth. I wasnt cheating on her but i was lying and doing cocaine so she would just grill me all the time and i didnt want to hurt her by telling her i was on drugs. So fast foward i started doing this thing where i would just disappear for 2 months because in my mind she was better off without me and i didnt want to cause her anymore hurt. But this womans the love of my life my perfect idea of what i believe a woman should be i would give my life for her. Theres nothing about her i think isnt perfect shes the only one for me.


 So id come back into her life after houdining myself out of the picture because i thought it was best but would think about her daily and when that would happen i would do coppeace amounts of drugs to block out my feelings and emotions. Fast foward to 
2 years ago when i swapped cocaine for opiates because i had a buddy who was getting percocets and oxycotin and thats when my love affair w opiates began not at first slowly but surely turned into full addiction. And the lies continued with my girlfriend her thinking im cheating on her with someone else, i was but it wasnt w another person it was with percocet that became my mistress. 

So as my addiction started fueling more n more my relationship took harder and harder hits. So i went to treatment for the first time last summer did really good in there and my relationship started to get better i was finally able to start becoming vulnerable and opening up to her which i wouldnt do before. But as soon as i got out of rehab i relapsed the week i got out. So i checked myself back in and that took a hit on my relationship again i did good again but relapsed when i got out again and it happened one more time. Where she was upset saying its not fair to me that i get the you i fell inlove with for a week then you have to go back dont you know what youre jeopardizing when you use do you not care about us?

 And that hurt cause shes the love of my life but at the same time i was putting the pills above her n us but it wasnt intentional at all if i could never use again i would. But its never that easy when youre an addict as much as i wish i could just ""stop"" it was to hard that monkey on my back was to strong. So this last time i went to treatment my mom told her to ""find herself and heal"" and to not talk to me right now . And it fucking hurts the only conversation weve had was that she needs time more time to love herself and find herself but she doesnt want to throw away 5 years of history we have but she wont even reply to my messages. And i dont know if shes moved on or what but this is the hardest pill ive had to swallow if she did move on.

 Like ive spent literary a quarter of my life w her shes the love of my life id give my life for her. And to know i may not ever get her back because of my choices and to do drugs because i was never taught how to deal w emotions or feelings so only thing i knew was to numb. The fact of accepting and letting go is such a hard concept for me because the feeling of not having her in my life is the exact same feeling/anxiety i get when im withdrawling and dont have any opiates, this feeling in my chest n throat that feeling of "" i need it"" like somethings dragging out of me to knock off anyone that stands inbetween me n percocet by any means or in this instance her. Thats how i feel when were not together or the thought of never having her in my life again like youre dope sick as fuck and you cant get any opiates that ""i need it by any means necessary"" feeling. 


My opiate users would surely understand, im sober now so its fucking w me how crazy the feelings are of how badly i would need pills when i was withdrawing and how i feel when she isnt in my life.  Its like im addicted to her like shes my dope and it hurts and usually id go and get high to not feel like this but i cant use i physically dont have anymore relapses in me my road w getting high is done. I was broken on every level that if im not sober i dont have anything at all. So thats not an option for me anymore because it wont solve anything n ultimately just make me far worse then i already feel.


 What should i do? Should i let go? Should i hold on n wait for her and give her the time she needs? Or is that just her nicely letting me down? I have no idea what to do and it fucking sucks how much this feels like im withdrawing off opiates but instead im withdrawaling off her. Am i just addicted to her? Im sorry for the long rant but i just need some advice on what to do in this situation honestly because i cant think logically about it and im an over analytical person that puts everything into logical scenarios but not on this it feels like my bodys moving but brains not exactly how it is when im getting dope idk why i do it i just do and my legs move n my brain clocks out for the day please give ya boy some advice on this situation."
"my partner (45m) has 3 kids and 3 bm's. his youngest child's (4m) mom owns a business that he works for. when i (25f) try to ask when he will stop working with her, it's an argument . im not cool with the emotional closeness and dependency. she still has his last name. hey folks. so my partner who i love and care for (and live with) is a hard worker, caring dad, and artful soul. he can be avoidant and passive. he's also very private. lately i've been noticing that he can articulate boundaries ( around the house, chores, my behaviors abd habits) but one thing that concerns me that i'm really not okay with is his proximity to his third child's mom. i have accepted her as a part of my life since the child is young and has special needs, but he works with her several times a week for hours at a time for her cleaning business. she pays him and then he pays child support. he has refused to introduce me to her ( blocking the doorway when i wanted to go outside to meet her ) and won't give a timeline as to when he will stop working with/ for her, even though he says if he had a choice he wouldn't be working for her but it pays $25 an hour and pays the bills. he's also a barber but hasn't been able to practice as much because 1) his barber license was taken away due to child support issues with his 17 y/o girl and then 2) covid19

he's worked hard to get to where he is and i'm not demanding that he quit that job instantly, but he is just not willing to listen to my boundaries on the issue, gets defensive when i bring it up, and when i explicitly asked him are there emotional attachments in this relationship, he will not deny it. he says however she feels is how she feels. their four year old doesn't always understand and is always inviting me over to his house to meet his mom. 

i can't say i'm a super jealous person, but i would think myself to be a fool if i didn't at least analyze the situation. this just doesn't sit right with me. 

we have been together two years. and for more i hope. 

last night we were having an argument about some things that i texted him  two days ago. it pertained to him not liking incense which i didn't know ( he said to stop burning it in the am due to his niece who lives with us. she's my age and happily unemployed ) 

he ignored these texts until last night. 

i texted him my feelings about the working for the baby mom situation yesterday, which he also didn't look at until last night. i made garlic shrimp pasta which we attempted to eat while we attempted to talk. finding compromise in our relationship has been a challenge. 

i'm the type of person who can be anxious and emotional , which he doesn't do well with. he makes it seem like it's a character deficit. he's on the complete opposite of the spectrum and my needs for assurance, affirmation, and validation are ignored. i've tried to say that learning the love languages of each other could go a long way. if i escalate his lack of response or emotion escalates me further. our talk ended with him throwing and breaking his beats headphones at my altar while i stood in the doorway, as well as a few other physical things. (that's a trigger for me, but not the thing i'm most concerned about currently) 

i really want to be with him, i enjoy visioning a life with him. but he says he worked with her before our relationship, and unless i will pay him $25 an hour, he will keep on. i told him he's very capable of finding something else. 

but ultimately for me if he is still working for her by next april i will move out. it's a me or her type of situation. i feel like my feelings are boundaries are ignored and i don't know what to do. i don't even know how to approach the topic of why she still has his last name. 

am i crazy like he says? are these feelings valid? is there a different approach i can take to setting clear boundaries ? is there a different approach he can take to responding to my emotions? 

a side note : i'm a specialist teacher at the elementary school across from the barbershop and his son will be one of my students next year, meaning his mom will be reading the comments i write on his report cards indefinitely 

**edit: he recently got the apartment caretaker position which will mean we will be saving a big chunk on rent , so maybe it will make it easier for me to ask that he stop working with his sons mother? 

thanks y'all. it feels good to just share"
"My fiance treats me awfully when I'm ill I've (30F) been with my partner (35M) for three years and we recently got engaged. Our relationship is usually quite good, however when I'm ill he acts just terribly. He's impatient, tries to find reasons why it's my fault that I feel bad, won't touch me. It's so alienating. Conversely, when he's sick I'm extremely hands on, I rub his head for hours when he has a migraine, I make him things to eat, I sit up with him, etc. And this never came naturally to me either, I'm not a nurturing person, but I taught myself to be caring because I was very much in love with this guy, and he just happened to be ill more often than any of my exes. I feel pretty lost. When I try to talk to him about it he plays the victim, says that I'm attacking him, picking apart his faults, and gets angry with me. I don't know if I want to be with someone who is good to me when times are good, but distances himself when I really need him. I would really like some advice on how to get him to recognise and change his behaviour. It's horrible not being looked after when you really need it by the person you live with and love."
"How do I stop feeling like a mom to my boyfriend? Hello! Boyfriend and I are both 24 and live together. This year will be our 3 year anniversary. 

I’m starting to realize my boyfriend doesn’t really do much. He works and makes money but doesn’t take care of anything at home on his own. He constantly leaves things out and has to be asked multiple times before getting something done. One task may take him hours to a week to get done. I feel myself having to ask all the time like I’m his mom. 

Also, with chores he never does them on his own. I cook everyday (unless there’s leftovers) but he won’t do dishes without being reminded. I’m the one that grocery shops and takes care of our pet 95% of the time. I’m starting to feel like a maid/errand girl/task reminder each day. How do I go about these feelings? Do I just quit cold turkey asking my boyfriend to do anything or doing anything for him? What’s the best way to go about this? 

I’m losing attraction and love for him because I don’t think I can rely on him for anything without asking or demanding it first. There’s no romance and very unequal balance of chores at home. 

TL;DR- Starting to feel like a mom to my boyfriend. Losing attraction/love for him and unsure the best way to fix this."
"My (17F) sister (25F) outed me to my parents I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for half a year now, I've kept it a secret since my parents arent accepting and on my job I can't afford to live by myself, I make £9.17 an hour and work night shifts so I can go college.

I had planned on telling my parents when I moved out and when things were more serious with my girlfriend, I know their stance on it but I guess I had hoped they'd change their minds.

My sister visited about a month ago, when she basically read my texts out loud hoping to embarrass me in front of my parents for having a boyfriend, it was revealed that well I was dating a woman and they gave me the day to move out- my girlfriends parents accepted me and took me in which I'm thankful for.

My parents were never the best, their type of parenting was yelling over you, I never celebrated my birthday, we never had Christmas and unless they were yelling at me they weren't around- I don't know why I'm so upset about them not accepting me, why I'm so upset about my family not accepting me but there we go.

My sister reached out recently and apologised.

I just don't know what to do, I don't know if I can forgive her.

I'm looking for opinions because I don't really know what to think."
"I (23m) rarely feel physically attracted to my long time gf (23f). Should I break up with her? My girlfriend (23f) and I (23m) have been in a serious relationship for the last 5 years (we met freshman year of college). She is the first and only serious girlfriend I have ever had. We graduated from college last May, got jobs in different cities and have been doing long distance ever since. 

Recently I have been having second thoughts about our relationship mostly stemming from the fact that I’ve never really felt a strong physical attraction to her. I have always had these thoughts in the back of my mind  but going long distance has made them stronger and quite frequent. She is one of the kindest people I know and she loves me very much. Recently, she has been talking about our future together and how she can’t wait to live together and have kids. I really do love her as a person and we’ve shared so many memories together but I can’t help but be scared by the fact that I might spend the rest of my life with someone I don’t really feel that physically attracted to.

I’m conflicted right now because I do feel a strong emotional connection with her and I’m worried that if we break up I won’t make a connection with someone like that again. We’ve spent so much time together the thought of starting from square one with someone new is intimidating. The thought of breaking her heart really tears me up too because she’s been nothing but good to me. What do you guys think? Any advice would be appreciated."
"My boyfriend lied about his age &amp; degree any advice? [19F] 
Yesterday (after almost a year of dating) my boyfriend broke down and told me he isn’t 23 as he ad previously told me but 25. We met when I was 18 and he was 24, but told me he was 22. He was my tutor in physics and maths when I was doing my a-levels last year and told me he had a first in mathematics from Bristol (which is what I’m hoping to get at Leeds/manc). He confessed he went to two universities but dropped out due to anxiety, he really struggled (thank god for jre and weed pretty sure it saved him). He explained how the last couple years have been super dark for him until we met. He says I saved him and that he can’t live without me. As soon as I could I called my mom (what a g) and she was as shocked as I was. I can’t get it out of my head “I have something to tell you, I’m actually 25”. I’m thankful he told me but how much of a red flag is this? It’s such a big thing to lie about and he says everything else is 100% honest he just lied about his age as he thought I would think he was too old for me... which maybe I would have but honestly I think I’d have the same feelings its just a number (within reason 👉🏻). He’s gone form a budding young lad with a maths degree to a lad with no path who lives at his moms. He’s really intelligent so I never questioned his degree. I’m just absolutely gobsmacked. My parents want me to leave him but I’ve never met someone as supportive as him. Basically I’m asking you guys how should I feel? How would you feel? I’m just god damn super freakin upset 👍🏻 Any advice is super appreciated."
"My (31F) fiance (36M) acts like a child and it's affecting my attraction towards him I don't mean he throws fits about things or anything like that. In fact, he becomes more ""average adult male"" when he's upset.

But the majority of the time we're together, interacting in any way that isn't a focused discussion, he uses this higher pitched voice and makes little whiny noises and uses baby talk words. 

Waking up: ""don't wanna get up, I want snuggles"" (proceeds to curl up and nuzzle me a thousand times like a cat trying to get comfortable)

We fart around each other (4 year relationship, it's gonna happen) and it turns into this 10-second long routine of ""did you toot? TOOOOOOOT! That was a big toot!"" Etc. 

I even tried a long, deep, as sexually charged as I could manage kiss last night, and his response when I pulled back was ""well, yay!"" Instantly changed the mood. 

I've brought this up to him before, when we first moved in together, and he said he just feels comfortable being vulnerable around me, which is wonderful. I completely accept that, and am fine with it here and there. But we're down to having sex MAYBE twice a month, and I generally have a huge sex drive. So all I can gather is that I feel like I'm living with a kid before we've even had any, and I'm not sexually interested in him while he's doing this. (To be clear, when we do have sex, it's like he flips this switch and tries to become ULTRAMAN and puts on sexy-face and I just can't believe it because of his day-to-day self so it throws me off.)

HELP. How do I approach this without making it seem like I don't love him or that I want to change him? He wasn't like this before we moved in together, and I just want my nerdy best friend back.

Edit: this isn't a post specifically about our sex life - this is a concern with our day-to-day interactions and my knowledge that he wasn't like this for the first year of our relationship. I have no intentions of leaving him - I truly love him and he cares for and takes care of me like no one else ever has. Do we just need to seek couples counseling?"
"Which will annoy my girlfriend the least? So I've just realised there's no toilet paper in the en suite, which is my best option?

A) Ask her to go get me some (she JUST started a movie)

B) Use a couple of her makeup wipes"
"Me [20F] and my bf [22M] keep having the same discussion every week yet nothing changes We’ve been together for coming on 3 years. At the start everything was fine and he actually used to avoid going on his PC entirely as his ex used to hate him being on his video games but I didn’t so I told him he should just enjoy himself and I don’t mind as long as I get time with him, but it’s gotten to a point now where, as we’re in lockdown right now so can’t leave the house, he will spend the moment he wakes up until the moment he goes to bed on his game. Sometimes will give me 30 minutes when we eat lunch but he’s still sat at his PC the whole time and I just watch something with him but sat behind him. He also said that is spending time together. 

We had this problem for a while before but he used to always say he was stressed from work and the PC helped him unwind so I didn’t argue about that, but we’ve been in lockdown for 5 weeks so he’s been off work for this time too and it’s still the same.

I’ve tried to have the conversation with him that we should spend time together as we live together, we can do more things like make dinner together and get dressed up or watch a film, something where we actually have quality time together and get to talk or just enjoy ourselves. Card games. Board games. Walk the dog. Every time he says that I clearly have a problem with him gaming and he’s not going to change his lifestyle for me but it’s not that at all. I don’t care about him gaming, I care about him spending all day every day gaming and when it comes to me he can’t even spare more than half an hour because everything I want to do is ‘boring’ and it’s almost like I have to schedule in time with him (which he usually doesn’t stick to anyway), he usually gives me times like ‘ok you have half an hour’ and will legitimately time it - note, I also have a PC and play video games but he doesn’t like playing with me because I’m not as good as he is. I’ve also paid for a lot of the equipment he uses like his green screen, his mouse, headset, monitors, keyboard. If I had a problem just with the gaming, I obviously wouldn’t put money in towards his stuff.

His main argument is that he tells me to join in on his friends discord where all his friends are and talk to everyone there but I said that isn’t me and him spending time together and I wanted it away from the computer as there never is time away. I get nervous speaking to a big group of people I don’t really know and they’re all playing the same game with no space left for me to play, so I don’t really see why I’d be there as they’ll all be talking about the game? Maybe that is a me problem though. I just don’t think that’s a substitute for us spending time together.

Anytime I’ve brought this up he’s gotten really angry at me. Today he told me he was even pissed off because he’s explained to me enough times that all he wants to do is be on his PC. I told him imagine how he’d feel if I was sitting at my desk all day just ignoring him and he had to hear me yell at games and slam my mouse down on my desk. I’ve even told him I get upset as he is basically telling me spending time with me is boring. He’ll tell me to go back to my mums house if I have such a problem with it (I live with him and pay rent, he doesn’t pay rent lmao) but he knows I don’t want to do that so I won’t argue back to that. Then he’ll be silent for like 5 minutes then just say he’s going back on his game, even if I say ‘have we come to a conclusion then?’ he’ll just go back on. It’s like talking to a brick wall. He’ll get annoyed if I bring it up again but we never come to any sort of agreement because he just does what I said above. 

I don’t want to leave him because I do really love him, I love video games just as much as he does but I also know how important quality time is. I just feel at a loss. I don’t understand how I can make him see that giving me 30 minutes of his time a week just isn’t right. 

tldr: bf plays games all day every day, limits me to 30 mins - 1 hour a week and says everything I like doing is boring (although I also play video games) and considers me watching him play a game or watch a video whilst he’s sitting at his PC ‘spending time together’. I love him so much and don’t want to leave him so I’m just stuck in a permanent rut where he ignores the conversation and we never come to any conclusion as ‘I can’t force him to change his lifestyle if that’s what he wants to do’."
"[19/f] I've been with my boyfriend (21/m) for about 2 years and I don't think I want to be in a relationship anymore When we started dating he was very abusive and had a lot of personal issues he had trouble dealing with. It's left me with scars that are still healing but he doesn't understand at all. He sees it as me holding it over his head when I'm just trying to be open about my feelings.
Recently (the past 6 months) my mental health has been getting worse and worse and I don't know if I want a relationship right now. Every time I bring it up with him he asks what he did to make me feel that way and why I can't just get over the past and it cuts me deeper every time. Then he gives me a list of all the awful things I've done to him and how much he puts up with when I can't do the same.
I don't know what to do.

Edit: the scars are metaphorical. Sorry for not making it clear, it was all I could think of to accurately describe it."
"My brother has a over controlling gf I(16m) have an older brother(26m) who lives with his gf

I met her years ago and she seemed really nice. But over time she started being really controlling and overall being a bitch. She trashed his perfectly clean house, makes him go to work with her without getting paid, and tries to isolate him from his family. I have personally witnessed her hit him on several occasions just so he would do something that was incredibly minor.

Awhile ago we found out that she was cheating on him with another guy and he didn’t say anything. He says he isn’t the type of person to break up even though I can tell that this relationship kills him mentally. What should I do"
"Confused by a text from a guy (21M) to me (20F) - Advice needed!!! I was texting with my friend/crush the other night and he said that maybe after quarantine is over he should take me out. But then added a laughing emoji afterwards and said he didn’t know what he was saying (he was tired).

Can anyone explain what this means? Was he being truthful in the first part and backtracked afterwards because he was afraid of my reaction (possible rejection)? Or do you believe he was just making a joke? Is that something you joke about?

This text has confused me, please help. :)"
"A (kind of hypocritical) untrusting partner I (18F), have been in a relationship for the last few months with my now boyfriend (19M). We had been talking since late December but because I had just left a toxic/abusive relationship with my ex fiancé I did not want to move to fast in my relationship w my current partner so we did not start dating until about March.
—
Backstory: 
When we first began talking I was timid and shy coming from an abusive relationship, my current partner, would have me come over late at night around 2 am so that we could hang. (He got off at 2) . I feel like I had been understandably tired given the time frame so obviously I would fall asleep. This I guess was an issue w my current partner and us talking was becoming less and less and I had suspecting another girl towards the end of us talking, given over a course of a few days he hinted that he believed I was “boring” (his words) and all I did was sleep. Before my current partner had ended things with me asked my partner if there was another woman and he told me no on multiple occasions saying that me and him just didn’t click, obviously this was suspect to me. I proceeded to ask again and he told me he met a Woman (20F) who he didn’t find “boring” and felt like he connected better with and admitted they had kissed and she had been coming over the last two days but said they never slept together during those two days. This broke my heart and things ended with me and my current partner and he ended a relationship with this woman. She ended up cheating on him and turns out they really didn’t have anything in common and she was actually crazy.
—
After this relationship of theirs ended we somehow started speaking again and slowly started seeing each other and by March we ended up in a labeled relationship on my terms because I agreed I was finally ready. We had discussed our body counts and I had told him mine and he told me his. I found out he had gone through my phone and believed I slept w a man I never slept w just Bc that man gave me money. This caused a strain on our relationship but still I stayed. I had suspected he lied to me about the people he slept with so finally I made the mistake of going through his phone and found out he did indeed lie, now for me I don’t care how many people he’s slept with I just want him tested for my own sexual health and security, he doesn’t want to get tested. After finding this out he finds a note in my phone of people I kissed and believes it’s my body count (it wasn’t) and texts me saying how I’m a liar and that he went through my phone, he knows I slept with an acquaintance of his, now I slept with this acquaintance around the beginning of December, I met my partner towards the END of December. My partner found texts of me texting my friend in February about that friend I slept w. So he convinced himself I slept with this friend in February and cheated on him while we began talking again, I didn’t. A lot of the texts he found were out of contexts Bc I was also FaceTiming this friend of mine talking about this situation. My partner claims he believes me but I know he doesn’t. I just don’t understand how he can be so ill understandings day untrusting of my situation when he wasn’t loyal to me and yet I still understood why he wasn’t and took him back. How can he believe I’m cheating when I’ve never had a cheating bone or interest or thought of cheating on him because I genuinely love him. I’m telling him the truth, what do I do?"
"5 types of people who ghost Dating is a true gauntlet. You joust your way through losers to find someone who seems worthwhile, only to soon find they pulled a disappearing act. Here are five types of people to be conscious of..
Https://1000mere.com/5-types-of-people-who-ghost-lifestyle/"
"Ex (m35)believes Covid was developed in a lab by the government - and thinks its overblown. He is out and about still. I (f40) am a healthcare worker - this drives home he was so wrong for me While I’m concerned for his safety, I wash my hands if he gets sick"
"I (22M) want to break up with my girlfriend (30F) because of the lack of sex We've been together for just over 3 years now, living together for 2. We have so much in common, same hobbies, similar life experiences, similar life goals. I love her a lot and our relationship is almost perfect. There's just one issue that keeps resurfacing: sex.

Before we started dating, I asked her straight up about sex and her interest in it. I asked her this because in one of my previous relationships, my partner was not interested in having sex and didn't tell me this until after we had been dating for 3 months. She told me that she considers sex a part of a healthy relationship and was still pretty into it. We ended up going official a few weeks later and things were peachy keen.

Over the past 3 years though, sex has been a big issue. I am usually interested in it  once or twice a week, preferably more but I would never want to push it. She was happy with this in the beginning but eventually this petered out. Nowadays, I would say we have sex once a month, if that.

I have sat down with her multiple times and discussed this, explaining that I am interested in having sex more often and asking what I can do to help her if possible. She shrugs it off a lot of the time, apologizes, and then our sex life will pick up for a month before it goes right back to being non-existent. I've asked her if there's something I can do, what turns her on, etc.  I put it out there that I don't even mind if it's just me doing something for her, but she still turns that down.

Quarantine has just amplified how noticeable this issue is, as our country restricted us from leaving our homes except for essential services. We both work from home with extra days off and no commute, so we have more free time. Our sex life has remained the same and we haven't had sex since the end of March. 

At this point, I realize that we just have vastly different sex drives and views on sex. A lot of the time, she doesn't even care if she finishes, she mainly just wants to please me. I am all about it being a mutual experience so this has made for some awkward situations. I honestly believe that she could go the rest of our relationship without us having sex except for once a year or on special occasions. 

I've thought a lot about it and I think that it is time for us to go our separate ways. Sex is a large part of a relationship to me as it's a way for me to have fun and bond with my partner. Even if everything else in our relationship is great, I constantly think about if I'm missing out on the right person for me that's out there.

I need advice about whether I'm making the right decision, I can't talk to my friends about this just because of the topic. If I do decide to break up with her, what do I even say?

tldr; together 3 years, great relationship except for sex. we only have sex once a month and i am interested in more, she is not. at my wits end and considering ending the relationship because there is probably someone else out there who better matches with me. is this the right decision and what do i say?"
"Text an ex from a very long time ago... I really want to speak to my ex who I think is the love of my life, well definitely my first love. We dated from 18-21, with lots of ups and downs. We are both 27 now and haven’t spoken in 4 years, mostly because he blocked me on everything . He found out I was “seeing” this guy he knew and that was the last straw from him, even though we were broken up at the time. I’ve heard he was devastated about our break up. Should I email him or is it abusing his boundaries?"
"Am I being played? Should I just move on? A little background is necessary so I’ll (24F) give a short and sweet one. My ex (27M) broke up with me last summer due to distance over the phone. We were together for 1.5 years. Reason being more because he was in still in school while I recently graduated, he didn’t want to not being able to give me what I deserved (attention wise) and I returned to my parents house for summer. When I moved back into the city for work and we reconnected. We decided that we still cared for each other and we wanted to be friends with benefits. For me, after our breakup, I made a decision to leave abroad for 10 months, he sent me an email when I was leaving telling me he loves me and not seeing me will be hard and that he will miss me. It was very sweet. 

Fast forward to now, we talk almost everyday and give each other updates, send photos and occasionally music we think each other will like or when we think of the other person. I still have quite a bit feelings for him (my own fault, I guess) but I’m undecided on whether or not he feels the same. Or is he just bored, and feels bad that he knows I like him and don’t want to just cut me off. Every so often, we go a few days without talking and just when I’m starting to do my own thing, he messages me and reels me back in (if that makes sense). He says he still wants to see me when I return. I suppose I’m just looking for clarity, don’t want to look like fool. Also just a little confused because we previously broke up because of the distance. 

In the big picture, should I just be moving on or keep talking to him and see how it plays out?"
"A new female friend I will try to not make this too long.  


Me and my boyfriend (Let's call him Jon) have been dating for over half a year now, which for some, I know it's nothing. We met on a roleplaying website and began to talk a lot, I was in a toxic relationship back then, so we became distant once I got closer with my ex-boyfriend again. Then I finally reached the breaking point and with the help of my current boyfriend, completely broke the ties with my abusive ex, and me and Jon began to talk a lot again.  


We got closer and closer, but there was a girl he also met on the website who got close to him while I was gone, they were planning a meetup and he called her his 'potential girlfriend', so we kept it friends-only. (Which was different from our usual, we really spoke with so much affection before.)  
Though she then somehow messed up and they stopped talking, he basically said she just fucked it up for herself or something, so we began to talk again, and even though we never became official or never said I love you to each other, we are technically dating.  


We both stopped going on the website after, but now that the quarantine is giving us a lot of time, we began to speak less and less, he got back to roleplaying on that website and slowly so did I, since I was just getting so bored, but also lonely. Now, I know I have a problem with my insecurity, which I'm working on, though there was always this girl who made me feel quite a bad feeling down in my stomach. (Let's call her Ellie)  
Ellie used to comment on John's every photo with stuff like ""wuv you best boi!&lt;3"", John is never really too affectionate to me much anymore, not since this quarantine started and his messages became a bit slower as well. I didn't think much of it until he told me he's been talking a lot with Ellie, saying she's cool and such.   


Now, they began to talk a lot, he's like ""Oh Ellie that and Ellie there"", I'm really trying to stay calm as he links me videos saying she showed him them.  Maybe she is cool, but I just cannot see it, especially with her commenting on every photo John has on that website which sounds like a classic thirsty girl. What would you think of this? Is it just my insecurity? My boyfriend has MANY female friends, so I don't mind them, one of them is actually so sweet and nice."
"How does one go about having The Talk with your SO? My(23F) boyfriend(22M) have been dating for over three years and we live together. We’re quite happy together even through this COVID situation and I love him very much. I’ve been wanting to have The Talk about our future (ie marriage, kids, and just life together in general) but I don’t know how to go about it without making it seem like I want this now. I know we’re still young but I want to see if we’re on the same page for our future."
"Struggling to move past a break up a year ago I [28f] broke up with my bf [31m] about a year ago. I can say that he was emotionally abusive, but I loved him more than anything. I was always begging for his love and attention, but rarely got it. To put things in perspective for you, we had been together for 3 years and he refused to let me meet his family/ meet mine. He struggled with addiction and depression. The breaking point was he didn’t want kids and I did. I finally left. 

I basically jumped to another relationship. I knew I wasn’t ready, but he treated me like a princess and I was ready to be done with that situation. I’ve been with a wonderful man now for about a year. I feel like he will be the man I marry. I’m still struggling with my last relationship though. I miss him all the time and I constantly wonder about how he’s doing. When I was with him, I constantly worried about him hurting and I still am. I am very angry that he didn’t try to make it work. I felt like he was my soul mate. Maybe this is part of the abuse because it doesn’t make any sense to me. It was a messed up relationship, but I loved him very much. 

After we split, he got therapy, lost a bunch of weight and quit smoking/ drinking. He made sure to tell me. It just made it all the harder. He also said he wanted kids and marriage. I just couldn’t go back. I can’t leave the man I’m with and I don’t want to go back to a situation that depressed me to my core. I’m struggling though. Some nights I get so sad and I feel immense guilt. Is this normal? Does anyone have advice on moving past this? I feel like my heart is just stuck and I hate it. 

TL;DR 
Having trouble moving on from a past relationship that wasn’t healthy."
"How do i(29f) breakup with my bf(24m) now that I feel the relationship is ruined&amp; he threatens to hurt himself. My boyfriend has been having a hard time in quarantine, drinks a lot, sends me long rants about self destructing, walking out on his job. Im having a hard time being supportive through memes and video chatting so we made plans to go to a hotel. I have not left the house in months and he was isolating so it was a big deal full of preparations to be safe. Plus this was our one day to spend time together since mid March.

I thought everything was good at first until we became intimate. We normally use condoms and it's okay. Part of our sexual relationship is domination (him) and submission (me) so long story short and hopefully not too much TMI but he used his position to decide to not use protection and finish inside me as well. He said he wanted to do something to me that I've never had.

I was so upset I sent him out of the hotel room to go buy pla. B and took a shower that reminded me of the one I took after I was assaulted as a teenager. Not one good feeling after. When he came back he acted like he had no idea id be upset, even though we've had many many talks about how I wouldn't like that as well as wanting to be on stable birth control before we had unprotected sex.

Its been 3 days and I've barely talked to him. In the past when I've felt unhappy about our relationship, he tells me that I'm the only good thing in his life, loving me was the only good choice he made, and he doesn't want to live without me, life isn't worth living without our relationship, etc.

Im scared to talk about my feelings. I don't ever want to have sex with him again. I'm also feeling overwhelmed by his mental state. I don't have any other real life friends because when people have a hard time, I am easily overwhelmed. I feel like shit and want out of this relationship.

We live in a small religious town where the cops have a cold attitude towards suicide. I don't know how to end my relationship and if anyone has been in a similar position id appreciate advice. Thank you for reading.


Tldr: I don't want to be in the relationship I'm in but when I talk about breaking up my boyfriend gets upset and brings up suicide."
"How do you deal with SO that is super busy? [32F] [33M] We still text everyday but you know the feeling that you’re waiting for him to wake up to just only get little time to talk? 

He’s still busy at work even on lockdown. I do understand that and he always gives me an heads up if he can’t talk to me as much but I just need more of him. 

 I don’t know how to open up this to him without sounding so needy/clingy. Please help?

TLDR; SO is super busy and I don’t know how to bring it up to him without sounding clingy."
"My [21M] girlfriend [20F] lost a close friend from a sudden illness (not COVID) very recently, and I need advice on how to help her through this. To respect the privacy of all involved, I will not go in detail into the circumstances surrounding the death besides that it was very sudden and very recent. 

We’re both juniors in college (we both live right off campus, so didn’t go home for COVID). We’ve been together for just over a year. I really like her. 

So like I said, a close friend of hers very recently passed away very suddenly. I once had a friend pass many years ago, so I don’t have too much experience with this. 

Again, I don’t really know what to do for her. So far, I’ve just held her and tried to relate as much as I could. Speaking with how I felt with my friend, I just told her straight up that this was going to just really suck for the time being. I told her how I understand how incomprehensible it is for them to be here one day and then just gone the next. I also said that the pain would never really disappear, but just that there’d come a time where she didn’t think of it everyday anymore, and eventually when she did, it would be better memories rather than the death. After all that, I just kind of held her and told her that she doesn’t have to, but if she wants to talk that I’d be here for her. 

She’s just been really quiet and I’ve tried to spend as much time with her as possible. Did I handle this correctly with what I told her? What else should I do. 

Another thing is that, as a college student, I kind of drink quite a bit. She doesn’t really other than on some occasions. She’s in my apartment with me right now sleeping, but earlier tonight, she asked if she could have a bottle of wine from me to feel better. 

Now this came as a surprise to me given she doesn’t normally drink, and in any normal circumstance I’d be all for this, but something just felt wrong about that. Like I’m sure it would make her feel better, but I can’t explain why, but I just didn’t feel good about giving it to her. She protested a little bit but then gave up. 

So I guess my question is, have I done the right things so far? And, what should I do going forward?"
"When is the appropriate time to open up about your sexual fetish/fetishes to your SO? Title says it all.  When is it the right time to feel comfortable about opening up about your sexual desires, fetishes, and preferences?"
"I finally broke up with my abusive pregnant gf I don't know if some people could read my last post some days ago on AITA. Where I called my gf chubby after tryng to make her understand that she had really unhealthy diet and she was treating me like shit. She insulted me for 5 months and slapped me in some occasions. So yesterday I finally took all of my stuff and went to my aunt's house.

Her family know everything what happened during her pregnancy and are disappointed with her. They offered me help. 

I have been thinking about this decision for some weeks and what made me be sure about it? Two days ago my gf got mad at me for not buying all the junkfood she asked for, we had a videocall with the doc and he said she had to stop eating unhealthy and junkfood when he saw how many weight my gf gained. He was surprised and she was all the time avoiding the doc's questions and advices. She turned the call off and began to say I was a bad bf, that I was in the doctor's side because I hated her. I tried to talk to her and she slapped me again and grabbed my hair calling me stupid man. That day I cried so much... I called her mom and explained everything at night while she was sleeping. She was shocked and at the morning she called her daughter. She cried and said I betrayed her. Never met such toxic woman in my life. I don't want to see her anymore. I packaged my stuff and my aunt came to help me. She couldn't talk to Rebecca or look at her face (my now ex gf). When she saw I was about to leave she beged me to not leave her. She never apologised for her behavior and she was taking advantage of me. So I left. 

Rebecca called me and said she would have the baby. She's almost 6 months pregnant. I said I am gonna send her money to help her but nothing more. 

I feel released now."
"My (f23) girlfriend (f20) feels like they arent in control of their sex life because of our sex drive difference. Where to begin... Obviously, sex is important to a relationship. My partner and I have been together for almost 2 years and sex is like the top 3 things that we fight about.

Now, I've always had a pretty low sex drive. Like sex is nice but I dont need it. There was even a while where I thought I was asexual but I'm pretty sure that was because of my meds (I take hormones) being too strong. But my girlfriend could (and wants to) have sex multiple times a day for multiple hours, which I just dont have the drive to do. Its not that i cant make her orgasm, its that they're sexual appetite is seemingly bottomless and no matter how many orgasms theyve had they still want more. Even if we've literally had sex for 3 hours that day, by that night they would already be ready to have sex again.

I just cant keep up. After a 3 hour sex session I dont want to do anything sexual for the next like 2 days. My body hurts and I have no sexual appetite. 

So herein lies the problem. Since my girlfriend's sex drive is so high, whenever I want to have sex they're most likely down for some fun times. However when they're wanting to get some action I cant always reciprocate. And I'm super aware that I don't fill their needs sexually, so we have an open relationship (not too useful with the Big Rona right now) and a plethora of sex toys. In my head these should be enough for them to find satisfaction outside of sexy time with me.

But they have struggled with finding new sexual partners and they dont enjoy using the toys by themself.

Because theyre really only able to have sex when I'm in the mood too, they dont feel like their in control of their sex life. And I feel like I'm being pressured into sex or at least being made to feel guilt for saying no.

How can I make this a winning situation? I thought having toys and an open relationship would help ease their feelings that they dont have control over their sex life, but it doesnt seem to be enough. What else can I do? I dont really want to have sex when I don't want (for obvious reasons) but I also want them to feel in control of their sex life.

What should I do?"
"I 25M am considering buying a hidden camera to figure out if my friend 24F is brining people in my house without me there and permission. So, I have this long term friend who I used to date like 8-9 years ago move in with me
during lockdown. She’s been through a tough time recently, lost a parent and had a toxic relationship etc. I had been on my own at this point during lockdown for 5/6 weeks so I thought the company would be nice and it would give her some free time (currently just me in a 4 bedroom house) It’s been slightly more stressful than I anticipated having her here, some reasons below; 


She wears shoes on the sofa 
She left cigarette butts in an incense tray 
She always leave her plates on the side instead of just putting them in a dishwasher
I’m constantly picking up little bits of stuff she’s left 
She will take some small food like milk, eggs etc without asking
She washed some clothes, took mine out of the dryer dumped them on the floor and washed her clothes 
Smoking out the window of the front room rather than going into the garden so house stinks of fags. 

So today she asks me if her boyfriend can come over, he’s having a tough time his dad is ill etc but I said no. I felt guilty but it’s lockdown we all have to respect the rules as much as we can, I haven’t seen my friends why should her boyf come over here? Now I could hear her phone call outside with her family and after I told her no they asked if he was coming over she said no and they said “oh well at least you can shag him on Monday” Now Monday is the day I planned to go home (2 hours drive) for half a day to bring my disabled mum some cooked food and say hello to my grandparents to lift their spirits (I have FFP3 3M masks). I’m adding 2+2 together and assuming that she’s planning to bring him round here and have sex with him without my knowledge or consent. If I confront her and ask her I know she will get very defensive and deny it. So I was thinking of getting a small camera from amazon hooking it up and just seeing if that happens. Do I sound crazy and psycho? My feeling is, if he does come round, she has to leave. And if he doesn’t I need to trust her more but I have this horrible gut feeling. What do you guys think?

Tldr: I suspect a friend I’m letting stay at my house will invite her boyfriend over for sex while I’m not there. I want to get a camera to find out if she does it or not. Am I wrong for this?"
"I (20F) can’t keep my room door closed because stepfather doesn’t trust me. Hi, this is my first post on here. I’ll try to keep it short.

My stepdad doesn’t trust me and I’ve been forced to keep my room door opened ever since. The reason behind it was due to me being forgetful and setting off the house alarm several times when him and my mother went on a 2 week cruise. 

I had a talk with him about it when they came back and explained the situation but he doesn’t trust me at all. I never had anyone in the house during that time and he doesn’t believe me. It was never like this before and I was able to keep my room door closed. My mom believes me in everything that happened. It’s been going on for about for months and it’s gotten to the point where I set up little contraptions to let me know he’s been opening my door when I sleep. I just feel weird having someone watch me sleep with the door open. I constantly ask my mom if I can keep my room door closed for tonight but she says if “You have nothing to hide, why close it?” I don’t have anything to hide but I want to keep my door closed when I sleep. It’s a feeling I can’t quite explain. 

Is there any way I can fix this situation?

Edit: For all those, telling me to move out. I wish but I can’t. I don’t have the funds. I still have my job and on top of that I can’t go anywhere due to Covid-19. Please keep this in mind. 😔"
"I [20 F] have to break up with my [22M] boyfriend. I'm still in love with him. it physically hurts me to even think about it. It's a horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. I am so in love with him. I know my parents will never accept him and if I choose him, it means not being able to talk to my siblings anymore, and that's not a decision I'm willing to make.

I want to break up as soon as possible because I know the longer we stay together the more hurt we'll be. But I can't bring myself to it. It's like I'm frozen in fear. We talk 24/7, go to bed on FaceTime together. He's my best friend and this is probably the hardest thing I'll have to do. It's not just that I'll be lonely after, it's that I'll have lost someone who I have a deep connection with. 

How can I bring myself to do it? How can I make it hurt less for the both of us? Please help"
"Need advice in my engagement, mixed feelings We’ve been together 10 years, engaged for 3 (yes! 3! Soon after we got engaged we had a lot of turbulence- a lot of fights and decided to push off planning a wedding until things were better between us. He acted horribly during this time (even shoved me, said some nasty things) and since has apologized and tried to make habits to change. We went to counselling and he started an ssri (more to help with his depression , also helped with anger). Things have been good for about 1 yr (not perfect but no name calling/abuse) he still gets defensive easily. We’re planning a wedding for next year

I’ve noticed I flip from being excited to nervous about our future. I will sometimes ruminate to the past, relive those traumatic memories and feel like this is a mistake. Other times I will focus on the good things and the changes he’s made and feel excited. 

He’s always had an issue with anger / emotional abuse (during fights /arguments).  I never fully realized that this was abuse till much later. Once I realized I demanded he stop. 

I’m basically nervous, is this change real? Permanent ? From the ssri ? Will the anger come back if he stops taking ssri ?
Will I ever truly fully forgive Him for the hurtful way he treated me 2 years ago, because as of right now I don’t think Ive forgiven him..."
"My boyfriend (23M) won't stop saying what comes to his mind even though he knows he can hurt me (22F) sometimes. But what he's saying is not normal imo. Am I overreacting? Hi. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. He just left my flat and I'm feeling lost and I'm probably going to a have a panic attack soon so I'm distracting myself by writing this post.

We started dating about two months ago. After a month we ""broke up"" because I found out he likes to do drugs (other than weed and shrooms) from time to time. I had an addicted father and I want to be nowhere near anyone who does it. I told him it's a dealbreaker for me, but didn't want to change him because it's kinda a big deal for him, and so we separated. He came back by himself after two weeks, saying that I'm worth giving the drugs up. But if it was like that I wouldn't be here ofc.

During those two weeks, a shitshow started. I have borderline personality disorder, he knows that, due to my trauma in childhood. He told me he understands that ""it must have been horrible to have an addicted father who died, but if he didn't rape or beat me,"" he can't see the reason why I'm so against drugs and excessive usage of alcohol. Then, when he came by himself with flowers to apologize, I thought he will be done with the drugs, because I was clear about them and he said he wants to be with me. But no. After that, we had the drug talk again and he told me that he will give them up, but ""congratulations, you're erasing a part of my personality"" and ""i would never give them up by myself"". When I asked why is he blaming me for that, he said he isn't and he knows it was his decision.

And finally, yesterday night. We were about to have sex and he asked me to do something I'm not completely okay with - it's his fetish and it's ok, but I didn't feel like it yesterday. I didn't say anything like ""ew no i will never do that"" or ""ew no you're disgusting"", I just said ""no, I don't want to do this now"" and he asked ""ah, and what would you do if I started looking for it somewhere else?"". I was shocked and after a while I asked what the fuck and he said ""well it's a normal thing people look for things they need but don't have"" and when I asked why is he even with me when he's going to do that, he said ""I didn't say I'm going to do that, only that it's a normal thing people do. I wouldn't do that."" So I was mad as hell, asking why tf he said that, did he want to only inform me about what other people do but he doesn't or what???? Then he started saying that he gave up drugs for me so I could think about doing things for him that aren't fully comfortable for me either. I do agree with that, but it's not barter..

With my BPD, I have abandonment issues and even though it's not his problem, he's hurting me like hell. After the last night I don't know what to think. He doesn't think he said anything wrong and when I ask if he thinks it's normal to say such things to his gf, he says ""it's the truth that people do that, I don't see a reason not to say it"".

Help, people of reddit? He's so kind and caring when we are good, but when shit hits the fan I feel like he has no filter in his brain.... what do I do? Or am I just overreacting? Thank you!!"
"My bf (20M) was telling his friends private info about me This sounds really bad I know but my boyfriend went to the shower and he left his phone and in his boys group chat, they were sending emojis and stuff and saying weird stuff, honestly I was worried my bf was doing gay stuff with guys that’s why I checked. Like hold up is he cheating on me, are they sexual or something. He wasn’t. Basically they kept asking him stuff about me like personal things regarding my anatomy down there and he caved and told them. I think that’s really disrespectful like why should these guys know if I’m an innie or outie (stupid terms anyway) and if I shave and my favorite position. what the fuck that’s just gross. They asked for a pic and he gave a hard no and said there’s no way he’d send them a pic of me. At least there’s that. I’m so mad he was talking about me like that, I’m not a confrontational person and I have anxiety so I just started shaking and felt like throwing up and when he came out of the shower I tried to calm down but I couldn’t even talk to him and I just went home. Now that I’m home, it’s easier to collect my thoughts and text him what I wanna say. It feels violating and gross. I see him a lot different now tbh"
"Boyfriend got fired and asked me to forget about us My boyfriend recently got fired from his job because of built of stress from being by himself and working at home during this lockdown. He totally dropped low and asked me to forget about us and our plans and move on. What should I do ? 

My bf has mental issues/ depression and he can flip easily and we have been in a very long LDR, we’re almost close to getting married etc. There has been times before where the same things has happened but he has always come back but the lockdown/quarantine has been depleting both of our mental health. It’s taken a toll on his mental health too much, as he is already a bipolar person. Obviously I love my bf dearly.

More story: We don’t live together yet. In LDR. Trip been postponed/cancelled because of lockdown. He blocked me on WhatsApp, something he does often to get better mentally as he has mental issues/depression/bipolar/extreme irritability and anger. Long relationship 6+ years. I’ve always been the “wife” to his eyes."
"Am I overreacting? My (30m) fiancé (29f) have been together just over 2.5 years now and have been engaged just over a year. Shortly after the engagement I noticed our sex life go from somewhat active to almost none at all. 

She has PCOS and blames it on that for not having a sex drive which I can understand. For the last 7 months we have had sex only 1 time and I try to be understanding about it but it’s getting to a point where no matter what I do I am the bad guy. 

Earlier today I tried to initiate sex but was shut down due to her being on her period which is understandable but the problem is she isn’t. I feel like a dumbass for even writing about this but I just don’t like being lied to. I would rather be told no in the worst way possible than be told a lie. 

Am I overreacting to this? Part of me says yes but at the same time feel I have a legitimate gripe. We also recently agreed to push back our wedding TBD due to COVID but at times I feel that she is questioning getting married and honestly there are times I am even questioning it. Am I overthinking this? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Ghosting So, I (21M) started to text with a Girl (20F) A few weeks ago. 
It started pretty basic with smalltalk and the basic texting stuff. 
Then we talked a bit about other stuff and more frequently. 
When I asked her if she wants to meet when it‘s allowed again she answered „Yeah, for sure :)“ 

Then, out of nowhere, she did not answer me. 
She read my messages and is also on her phone daily and (at least I‘d say) pretty frequently active/online.
When I texted her again she did not even read it.

Should I wait and give her more time or maybe text another time?"
"How do I stop running from guys who care about me? F22 In the past, the only way I could be in a relationship is if I got forced into one. Ie: my ex basically said ""if you won't be my gf I gotta cut ties with you."" I didn't want to lose him so I agreed. Despite being pressured into relationships, I always felt like I made the right decision (I was happy in all my relationships and enjoy monogamy). The hard part is when I'm single!!

So here's my problem (and I know a lot of people experience this but I don't know how to fix it). A few months ago, I was casually dating a guy long distance. He flew to my hometown and it was amazing. Afterwards, he started saying he loved me, he couldn't be without me, he thought about moving to my hometown etc. and I freaked out. He is very good at expressing his emotions and this put me off so much.

I figured ""maybe I should date guys that are more reserved with their emotions and less sensitive."" I meet a guy and we hit it off amazingly! We talk non stop and get along so great. He is very mature but more reserved with how he expresses his self. In my mind I thought ""this is perfect, he makes me feel comfortable, doesn't come on too strong etc."" I started to get major feelings for him but then this...

Tonight he texts me saying ""I feel like we knew each other in a past life because our connection is so crazy. You have me feeling some type of way and I have never felt like this about another person. I know its too soon but you're my girl""

Now I am second guessing everything. I feel like everything he said just put me off and I don't know why!! What is wrong with me and how do I fix it?"
"Saucy pet names for my girlfriend? I've been calling her classics like babe and baby but I feel like it's too generic

"My GF [20F] is depressed because she cannot spend quality time with me [19M] during this period. What can I do? Her mum doesn’t let her get in the car with me because she’s paranoid about the virus. I have zero risk of having the virus to begin with. My family hasn’t been out of the house in months, and we get groceries delivered. 

I can only see my GF once a week, and we have to go for walks only while maintaining social distancing. I spend an hour travelling to and from her house for 3 hours of walking in the countryside. 

We’ve been together for around a year, and I love her to death. But we haven’t gone for a ride in my car, visited each other’s house, or got intimate in over 2 months. She’s really depressed about this, and I’ve ended up counseling my own GF week after week. It’s a huge burden to have and I cannot do anything about it. 

We don’t know how longer we won’t be able to meet up normally. She cannot cope without me and her sadness has been spilling into my life (I can cope for some time without her, but seeing her cry every week breaks my heart). We’ve been arguing more over this period because of the long time away from each other. I don’t know what I can do to make her happy, she is extremely dependent on me for her happiness. 

What can I do?"
"UPDATE: My (22F) family make me depressed and I don’t know what to do Original post here: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gf26im/my_22f_family_make_me_depressed_and_i_dont_know/)

Thank you for all your responses. I promise I read every single one and it meant more than you know.

What I did end up doing was calling my Dad. We talked and he told me that I’m welcome to stay over at his for however long I wanted. I told him I really wanted to sit and think this through and would let him know in a few days.

The reason for this was because my family have weakened immune systems and I was told that once I leave this house, I wouldn’t be allowed back in essentially. So I wanted to think this through - carefully and rationally. Every time I debated it though, I couldn’t help but think back to this one comment that said that my mother sided with my rapist. And I feel this is what has essentially happened over the years.

I told my mother today that I was thinking about staying with my dad for a bit. She told me to just let her know as soon as possible so she could fill my room. And that if it was because of the outbursts from my sister than I wasn’t being a responsible adult. Then said later to really think it through. 

My dad told me to let him know in the morning. I feel a lot of doubt and uncertainty has been placed on me - especially with my mother’s words. It is a long way to travel with work and the buses don’t work out unfortunately in places...but my dad said we could try and make it work. 

My heart hurt truthfully at my mum’s words. She’s spent today acting like normal so I almost feel guilty in some way. I feel like I’m making a massive decision tomorrow morning. But I’ve packed my stuff tonight to last me for a couple of weeks. I’m hoping I wake up with the clarity I need tomorrow morning. 

But thank you all for being there, commenting, and helping me along the way."
"A drunken hookup with my friend has made me question if I was assaulted the first time I had sex... TLDR: I had sex with one of my best friends under similar ish conditions to the first time I had sex. I was convinced my first time was assault but I don't feel the same way about my hookup...why?


When I (21F) was 19, I lost my virginity to a guy named John (22M at the time). I had never been tipsy let alone drunk, but after 2 drinks (enough to get me veeery drunk bc I'm a huge lightweight) I ended up losing my virginity to John during what I thought was a hangout at his place. Here's what I clearly remember:

1) John knew I had never even kissed a guy before let alone had sex or anything close
2) I definitely consented to sex. In fact there were times he asked me if I was sure and I said yes, don't worry about it...I was riding the ""woo I'm finally losing my virginity"" high and not thinking clearly
3) I also definitely 100% did not consent to certain things. I did not want him to go down on me and when we went to sleep I wanted to sleep with my clothes on as I was really uncomfortable with my body and being naked in front of someone else. Both times I said no several times but he thought I was just being ""coy"" and didn't listen
4) He did something that to this day thinking about makes me shrivel up inside. Guys, being a virgin who had not expected to lose her virginity that day...I hadn't quite cleaned up certain areas. John took it upon himself to do exactly that, while I was spread eagled in front of a basic stranger wishing I could leap out of my body. It was humiliating and I don't know what on earth possessed him to do it. Ofc this was also something I had said absolutely not to, and for some reason he thought I was embarrassed about but would be fine

I went home the day after and couldn't function from how much I wanted to jump out of my own skin and how much I regretted what happened. Looking back, based on how I felt at the time and things John has said after, I'm not sure what to make of it. He was dealing with a lot of his own problems at the time regarding sex too...at 22, he was a virgin (not when he met me though) and was deeply insecure about it. So I think he ignored certain things he shouldn't have because of his need to just prove his own worth and also because of his lack of experience. Like I think he thought assault only counted as such if the girl was pushing the guy off and screaming. At the time he didn't realize that saying no to certain things MEANT I was not into them and didn't want to be / couldn't be persuaded otherwise. We dated for 2 years off and on after that.

Flash forward to now. I have since been in another much much better relationship and had other hookups. One in particular stands out. I came home super upset and my roommate and really close friend at the time comforted me. I was also super drunk at the time. One thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. Now here's why this stands out in particular:

1) I was VERY drunk, same as my first time
2) I was upset at the time and not in a great headspace, just like the first time when I wasn't mentally prepared or in a place to have sex... 
3) hoo boy I regretted this so hard the next day. Like I'd think about it and cringe and scream why at myself on a loop. It wasn't at the level of wanting to completely jump out of my own body, but definitely something I wish I had not done.

And yet, this hookup is not something I would ever consider assault...it didn't mess me up the way thinking of my first time still fucks with me. I think if what had happened that first night had happened now that I'm more comfortable with sex, I would have been pissed about him not listening but would have also known to be much MUCH more forceful about expressing myself and what I was uncomfortable with and the night might have gone differently. 

After my first time, John was still pretty new to sex and didn't have a very good read on me. Some things kept happening where I would feel I had been pretty clear about not wanting to have sex or wanting to stop or not being in a place where it was an option that I felt got ignored. It's really important to note that over the next 2 years, he made a conscious effort to fix a lot of those issues and make me feel a lot more comfortable...he would ask numerous times if I was still into it, and if he even thought I wasn't enjoying it anymore he'd stop and not pressure me in the slightest to do anything further. This was true about 97% of the time...but there were still occasional things that would set alarm bells off in my head, right up until the end. A few weeks prior to our breakup I CLEARLY said I'd prefer he not do something during sex that was his fetish and he interpreted that as ""not super into it but sure go for it"", and did it anyway. He lied saying it had been a misunderstanding and then eventually came clean saying he knew I hadn't been into it but he didn't know how else to get off. That was the last straw and I finally ended it.

And now I'm not sure. Did that first day make me hypersensitive to things that are annoying but normal in sexual relationships? Was I too quick to judge his intentions as malicious bc I believed he had hurt me that first day? And I guess the hardest question is...did I overreact... were the feelings I had after my first.time normal feelings of not being ready / regret over losing my virginity in a way I hadn't anticipated or were the horrible feelings BECAUSE of his actions?"
"I can’t be myself around my gf anymore Since distancing we’ve had to began talking primarily digitally and road blocks have really started forming. Primarily she doesnt express her emotions much and gets upset if I pressure her into doing so. I understand this and no longer ask how she feels about me but she still gets upset by some things and it seems like I increasingly can’t say my mind anymore.

 Tonight I told her I wanted to try and make us last through any quarantine stuff and that I wanted to hold on for her. She basically ignored this and didn’t even acknowledge that I said it and I questioned that and she became upset with me. I then had to calm her down to return a conversation to normal and it was later when we were talking that I began getting a bit choked up and started to cry.

I can hardly tell her how I feel anymore without her getting upset thinking I expect her to have to reciprocate. Furthermore I brought up my issues with trust and being able to speak my mind another time and she got angry, so I’m scared to speak freely now. Life is crazy too, my grandmother died and there’s so much change it all got to me and I just began crying as we texted. I’m scared to tell her now because I don’t know if she’ll want to know this and hear me bring up these issues with me being able to be myself. It scares me to tell the truth because I don’t want to start a fight, but I truly do care about her still she’s by no means an awful person.

I want to compromise or something but I’m terrified she’ll snap at me and hate me for crying and being weak like that. It’s hard saying all the complements in a relationship and doing so much work when you can’t freely enjoy yourself.

Tl;dr: gf gets mad at pressure to be romantic and I can’t tell her about my feelings without her getting mad. Don’t know if I should tell her I cried about it."
"Why am I obsessing I [20f] have a best friend for over 2 years [19F] and I’ve noticed in the past 2 months I’ve been obsessing about her. I want to know where she’s at, what she’s doing etc. I’m happy when she’s working because I know she won’t be with her other friends, or texting other people. I’m happiest when I’m with her.  I think about her constantly. We’ve talked about it, and I know it bothers her vice versa. What the fuck is going on?"
"""If we work out"" So my bf of 10months was watching a movie and randomly said, ""Babe, if we work out and we get a house and live together, you're gunna have to be the brains for the both of us  because I'm not that smart."" Then after telling him that he is, he said ""Im nervous about what to do after I get out"" (of the military). I told him we will figure it out as time goes on. I said I love you and vice versa. Then I said, ""Wait, if we work out?"" He responded, ""Yes if we work out."" Should I be worried about the ""if"" statement? Or am I just overthinking this? We have had some ups and downs, but we have been really great lately."
Me and my girlfriend have been in an unhealthy state and we both wanna make it better but we don’t know how to We have gone through ups and downs before in our relationship and this is a down part in our relationship. The reason of of unhealthy state is mental health. We haven’t been having the best mental health state because of I guess self isolation during quarantine. My gf has been trying to reach out to people about it but they aren’t really helpful. I made this post so I can find some ways to make it better during this self isolation and us not seeing each other because of the virus.
"Bf issues?? Me and my boyfriend have been in a long distance online relationship for a year. We took a break for a couple months bc I needed time off for school. But we got back together, and I noticed his followings, they were mainly really pretty models and porn stars. And beforehand he never followed anyone like that. Even really attractive locals. I’m a VERY insecure person. And it made me really jealous, irritated to see that. And ofcourse I brought it up eventually bc it kept eating me up as I tried to ignore it as completely normal. And thennn he told me he followed them to make me jealous when we weren’t together. I thought It was scummy, but I think he was lying as an excuse to just look at them. Plus if it was true, wouldn’t he unfollow them by now since we’re together? I know it’s stupid and most people would think I need to work on my insecurities but it’s just kind of a whole respectful kind of thing for me. I never do that sort of act, I never get attracted like that and follow males. It could be just me, but I do it bc I’m really in love with him. It scares me tho, my last relationship he followed models etc. and he kind of expected that sort of perfection from me which made me feel this way. I’m just very insecure in general. He does tell me he loves me and he’s only attracted to me but I think it’s kind of weird and dishonest since he’s following them? Idkkkkk, I feel bad bc I don’t wanna be controlling but it’s eating me and I love him, I’m scared to keep bringing it up as annoying. I just don’t think it’s okay to follow sexual accounts in a relationship. Even if it’s long distance.. I’m a fucking dumbass :("
"My (24M) girlfriend (23F) has done too many favours for me and it won’t let me break up. Please help. Sorry for the long post. But I feel like the details are important.

I met her in the worst phase of my life. I was getting over my ex who had passed away like 6 months ago and gotta admit I was in depression and was not doing well both physically and mentally. I had lost my position in university politics and was not even taking any classes. It won’t be wrong to say that I was on my knees. Please note that this is not who I was before the passing away of my ex. I was doing very well every way.

I met her (my current girlfriend) in January 2019. She felt like sunshine when I first saw her. We instantly clicked. I forgot about everything that was wrong with me and wanted to just watch her talking and laughing. Was it love at first sight? I really don’t know but I had never felt that way for any other girl. 

We started getting close to each other and eventually started dating. Let’s just say our connection was getting very deep day by day. She was very supportive about whatever I was going through back then. She would go leaps and bounds for me. One month after we started dating - I fell really sick. Had my chest X-Ray done and everything. But she was there with me all this time. She lived like 2 hours away and would take buses and skytrains to come see me and take care of me be it cooking food or bringing meds - all after her 8 hour long work shifts. She cared for me and she proved it. 

Fast forward another month, as if the issues I was facing weren’t enough, financial difficulty knocked at my door. Because of a business loss back home, I suffered so much because of financial issues and I did not have work permit so I could not even work so I was just trying my luck in online businesses. Being highly intuitive, she felt that something was wrong. I tried hiding it from her at the beginning but she got to know. My situation was very bad that I couldn’t even pay my rent. But still, she was with me. She hugged me tight and told me not to worry. She lent me some money and on top of that would pay for everything. She was not super rich either. It was her hard earned money which she earned by working on minimum wage.

She would show up at my place randomly with heavy bags of groceries so that I don’t have to spend any money by myself. 

But with time, I found out that she has temperament issues because of her childhood traumas (she came out of very strong out of those traumatic events but reminiscences could be felt). We started fighting over very small issues (e.g. cooking sth a certain way and not following her way). She basically wanted everything her way and it lead us to fight. We had so many fights but we resolved them after the situation used to calm down. 

There was literally one point when she lost it totally and started banging things around. She even slapped me that day. The reason? I was texting my friends who wanted an update about a hike plan we had. She couldn’t take it when I asked her to wait a little and let me finish. The room was messy and she wanted me to help her clean it which I was going to but I just asked her to give me 2 mins. Due to the noise of banging objects here and there, 911 was called on us. And we were on probation for 24 hours. Her mom called me and told me how much she has been crying all this time. She felt really bad and showed up at my place to say sorry for making a huge deal out of nothing. She was crying and I couldn’t see it. We got back together.

Two months had passed by and I had to move out of my apartment because of financial issues I was facing. Despite living in a dorm in a small room, she offered me to move in with her till I find a cheaper place.

We started living together. She was very supportive all this time. She never let me feel bad about whatever was going on. Treated me like family. 

It went on like this for like 2 months (I lived with her for 2 months) - we would fight/argue and then say sorry. We had very good times together too. She used to share her childhood incidents with me. She basically opened her whole book of life in front of me. How she had been devoid of love all this time and everything. We got really close in these two months. We fell in very deep love. Only thing that was between us - her anger issues. Even her father warned me about it. 

So after living with her for two months, I had to fly back to my home country to see my family and everything. It was hard to leave her, even harder for her to let me go. But she insisted that I should go home because that’ll help me recover faster. 

After coming back home, I thought that the fights will eventually end. But no, they didn’t. She started picking up things from the past - how I was useless, a depressed person and what not and would fight with me. We would argue and I would try my best to calm her down. I would be the one who used to say sorry even if it wasn’t my fault. She had done too many favours already. I had to bow down every time. 

She would say sorry too and admit that she just misses me and I shouldn’t have gone. But this cycle kept on going. She would start the drill every 2-3 days and call me things - “homeless”, “useless”, “depressed f**ker”, “weak”, “manchild” and what not. Why? Because I left her alone. (But it was mutually decided and I was gonna go back anyway)

It kept on going like this for like 2 months. We would fight and then I would say sorry and then she would say sorry and we would start our lovey dovey convos again. I was the one to bow down every-time. 

Then she came to visit her parents (yes we are from the same country but different states) and they went for a vacation to a place which was 4 hours away from me. She invited me over to stay with them for a couple days. I stayed with them for 3 days and I found out some strange things about the family. 

She comes from a broken family. Her parents had been divorced most of her life and recently got together for her. They fight all the time. I did not witness a single hour when they did not fight. Always in a cold war. Including my girlfriend. 

But I also found out that she actually really loves me (because I had started doubting it the way she used to call out everything she did for me), she used to sit next to me when I slept and watch me with her moist eyes. I used to wake up and find her sitting next to me. Those three days - we did not fight even once and I loved it.

Then she had to go back and I was supposed to follow her in a week or less. She cried when I left.

She flew back and I found out that I won’t be able to fly back anytime soon because of my visa issues. It was delayed by months. 

I gathered the courage to tell her but she couldn’t take it. She broke down. She cried so much. And the same cycle started - arguments over phone and calling me names and then apologizing. 

She had started telling me that “I owe her my life” because she had invested so much in me. I wanted to go back eagerly too because I was missing my classes and I really wanted to see her too. But she would not understand and kept fighting. 

And when I was supposed to go, we got hit by COVID-19 curfew. I will have to wait till the flights resume again. But she still continues to carry on the fighting trend. When I got immune to all the names she was calling me - she started calling names to my family. She would curse my family. The same mother she talked to multiple times and called her mum herself. She cursed her. She cursed my brother. She cursed my sister. Basically everyone related to me.

Yes, she has done so many favours to me but she did all of them by choice. And I am extremely grateful for everything. But I am not staying away from her by choice, I am stuck here. 

Please help. Should I break up? I really don’t want to because I really love her. She had done so much for me. Now I am back to who I was. I am doing financially well and have a high earning business of my own. I want to compensate for everything that she went through all that time. I don’t want to leave her in a worse state than I found her in. I really wanna give her a great life. But at the same time I don’t want to go through all this drama again and again. 

She knows about her temperament issues and she says she is trying to change. 

I owe her too many favours. How do I deal with this situation? 

Please help. Thank you for reading this long text."
"Girlfriend giving me the silent treatment We had a small fight. At the end of the fight I apoligized for my part of it and told her that I would appreciate it if she apologized to me as well. Radio-silence afterwards. It's been 2 days and she hasn't messaged me at all. I'm feeling very down about it because I see that she's online quite a bit playing games with her friends. 

She knows how much I love her and she has told me that she also loves me and this situation just feels so incongruent with that sentiment.

I realize that a lot of people are ""I need time to back off and think"" kind of people, but I'm a ""let's solve this issue now"" kind of person. So as time goes on with a problem remaining unaddressed, I actually get more and more frustrated instead of calming down. However, if this were the case, I would think it would behoove someone to let their partner know that they needed time and space instead of just going ghost.

I want to reach out, but I don't want to set the precedent of me being the bridge-builder after every issue. I want her to learn how to take initiative in tackling issues as well, especially since she *probably* feels like I don't warrant an apology.  At the same time, as the days go by I feel like I'm slowly but surely losing her.

Thanks for your time."
"Anyone currently dealing with a breakup during these times? So I (28f) recently ended things with a guy (29m) I have been seeing for 7 months and it was so hard to do and I was incredibly miserable. My self esteem was shot, I have severe anxiety and panic attacks from it and I was putting in way too much effort into this guy. I had no choice but to end things to save my sanity. However, I’m really struggling to move on since we live together. I love him and it sucks that we can’t be together but I desperately need to move on. Is there anyone who is currently dealing with living with an ex that can give me advice on how to move on?"
"How do I tell my partner that I don't want to receive flowers anymore because it has a negative connotation for me My partner (30M) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years. 

My partner would always give me flowers during occassions.. Don't get me wrong I appreciate it. However, sometimes I feel like he is just giving it because it is the easiest thing to get. Last time, I told him that it is okay if he won't give me flowers on the next occassion. I told him that it's too expensive and I only get to keep/display it for a few days. I even said that  maybe he could just give me things for our house (we recently moved to a new home and still dont have everything we need) or something I could use in the long run. He said yes to that idea. But one time he said, ""you didn't like it?"" And I said, of course I liked it.. maybe my face was just a bit sad because before he surprised me he said he was in an little road accident but I shouldnt worry and I worried a lot (probably because I just gave birth and my hormones was still messed up? Lol). only to find out that he was just buying time so he could buy flowers on his way to me.

I keep 2 or 3 flowers everytime he gives me a bouquet.. I would hang the flowers upside down, let them dry, store some or use them in some of my paintings. I do it so I could keep a remembrance of that specific bouquet.

But now that we have a baby, I keep feeling bad because the flowers are expensive and I know I am just going to throw them away after a few days. Money is not an issue here but I really feel like it's not worth it. I somehow miss the days where he would buy me books, a cap, a watch (almost the same price as the bouquet), clothes, etc..

I also noticed that he started to get just flowers after we got back together after breaking up (and him having a one night stand) it was kind of like the Ross and Rachel thing where they were arguing if they were on a break or not.

I've long forgiven him for it (though I still get sad when it crosses my mind)

Another thing is receiving gifts isn't really my love language so I wouldn't mind if I receive nothing.

Mother's day is coming and today I found out that he bought a bouquet from my friend (I saw him commenting on her for sale post) so that he could give it to me on Sunday.

Flowers now has a negative connotation to me. I feel like he gives it after a mistake or a lie.

In the last year, I probably told him 3x that it would be better if he gives me another thing or if we just go somewhere (like on a date)

How do I tell him that I really do not want flowers anymore without seeming unappreciative and without offending him?

I know a lot of ladies would feel so good when they receive flowers but that is just not the case for me.

Tl;dr my partner keeps giving me flowers and I really do not want to receive them anymore because it just goes to the trash after a few days

Edit: added age

Edit 2: one of his love languages is receiving gifts. I always take a mental note of the things he like no matter how cheap or expensive it is. And I always make sure that he gets what he really want"
"Am I desperate for trying to fix things with my ex boyfriend? A few days ago, me and my boyfriend broke up. I was literally heartbroken. He told me he thought we weren’t compatible, we’d be better as friends, and that there’s a chance we’d get back into a relationship in the future. He told me that he wants to be friends, and that he has never been friends with any of his ex’s so I’m special. He said he just needs time to grow and work on himself, which I respect. Anyways, after the breakup we still continued to text, I initiated most of the conversations, asking him how he’s doing since the breakup, and things of that nature. I still care about him deeply, and he cares about me (I would hope he’s telling the truth). Last night me and him had sex. What does that mean exactly? He says he loves me and he misses me, but why is he doing this? I felt like instead of fighting for our relationship, he didn’t care to fight at all. How should I go about this, is it even worth fixing?"
"My bf thinks I should say sorry for something I think is very silly Kinda long post, sorry about that. This whole situation is very silly but we're mad at eachother right now and both not sure what to do. Also my English is not always on point, it's not my native language.

First, my boyfriend and I have this rule that I do all the cooking and he washes the dishes. Today my boyfriend hadn't washed the dishes in a few days so the kitchen counter was very full. I told him I wanted to make an egg for lunch, and so did he. He asked me if he could make one first and I said that was fine. He went to the kitchen and saw all the dishes and said to me he would wash them first before making the egg. This got me annoyed, because this has happened before. So I told him he could just wash the pan first, make the egg and wash the dishes after so he would have enough energy left (it often happens that he loses energy when not eating enough and I wanted to prevent that). So he told me I should just make my egg first and he would make his after he had done some of the dishes (because he has trouble cooking when the counter is so full, makes everything confusing in his head). 

After saying this, he grabbed one of the pans for my egg and started washing it thoroughly. He did it in such a way that I thought he was angry, because he handled it in such a fast/aggresive way, if that makes sense. He didn't clean it very well either, so I thought he was putting his anger in washing it. Now what happens next we are still debating on because we both remember different versions. In my version it went like this:

 I asked him if he was angry. He said no and asked why I thought so. I explained to him it was because of how he was acting while washing the pan. He said that he was not angry, so I said ""oh okay"" and just went on. 

In his version it went like this: I told him that he shouldn't act so angry. He said ""I'm not angry why do you think so"". I explained to him why I thought so. He said no again. I said ""Oh okay"". 

Now in either version you might think that it's settled now, he told me he isn't angry and I believe him so it's okay. Right? After this my boyfriend DID get angry at me, because he says I accused him of being aggressive. He wants me to say sorry, and it's the only thing he cares about right now. I explained to him that I don't feel the need to say sorry in this situation, because I simply felt insecure about his behavior and wanted to make sure everything was alright. I never 'accused' him of anything in my opinion, I just felt scared that he could be angry, but the moment he told me he wasn't I was okay because we trust eachother. 

He asked me why I even thought he was angry in the first place, so I explained to him that my past with my aggressive father sometimes leads me to being insecure about the smallest thing and that I'm always looking out for when someone could be angry because it's such a deep fear I have. When I told him this he got angry and told me I was playing the victim role now. 

After this I started crying and went to a different room to cool down. After a while he came to me and we calmly went through it all together, but what it comes down to is that he thinks I should say sorry because he feels offended that I thought he was aggressive, he says that I made a mistake and should atone for it. But I think saying sorry doesn't make sense, I didn't make any 'mistakes' I was just being an insecure mess and wanted to make sure everything was alright between us. What would I even say sorry for? That I have a messy past and it makes anxious? I'm sad for him that he feels offended but we've been together for 4 years and he knows I can get scared easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I thought my boyfriend was angry at me, turns out he wasn't and now he wants me to say sorry for thinking he was."
"Relationship distancing It's really hard when your boyfriend doesn't open up to you. Every time I would ask what's wrong, he would always say ""Nothing!"" but you can always see in his action that there's something wrong. I'm really trying so hard to help him in every way that I could, even opening topics which I expect would lead him to tell what's going on. Don't get me wrong, he loves me and I feel it in words and actions, but I just wish that he could be more open and specific to certain things. What should I do?"
In need of advice for cheating partner I (28m) have just found out my partner (27f) slept with her friend (27m) of 19 years last night. We have been together for 13 years and married for 3 and have 4 children together. I’m just at a loss at how to feel about this and how to move forward.
"Should I(18F) break up with my boyfriend(18M) of 10 months just because he thinks feminisim is anti-men? Hey, so I had just recently found out that my boyfriend doesn't like how women is making feminisim into a political movement and that he said patriarchy is not that present in our country and that women are just anti-men. I mean like wtf, this completely blew my mind off and I don't know how to feel, I have explained to him my viewpoints and I got exhausted so I just told him to search it up, he said he did but I think he still thinks that way. I didn't say anything anymore because I didn't want to argue over text and I'm lazy."
"How do I get my man to broaden his sense of fashion outside of jeans and a t-shirt? Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love him, and I will never ditch him or ask him to change his clothes (been together for 2.5 yrs).

He’s very handsome, 6’1, broad shouldered, brown hair, green eyes, Norwegian fella. As a video game artist, his office doesn’t have a dress code. So he just wears cargo shorts and blue t-shirts he’s had since high school. He’s 28."
"Was it love ? I was in q relationship with a girl for 5 years we were very happy in our own little world.  Until one dsy her father decided to arrange her a meeting with a guy for marriage , she promised me that is going to meet up the guy and then tell her dad that she didn't like him and that she wants to marry me and will do whatever it takes to marry me . But after she met him got to know about the guys financial status and that he is the owner of group of schools. After the meeting she told her dad that she loves me but her dad tried convincing her that i m not settled whereas that guy is well established so she should marry him .. she instantly agreed to marry him and blocked me up from everywhere and asked me not to try contacting her ... i cried begged but she dint care .... she married him and i m left alone with our memories of our own little world ... was it love ? She didn't even give a second thought to our memories is money so much important that a person who considered her his life was nothing infornt of a guy about whom she only knew his financial status ?"
"I kissed a girl, and he didnt like it. TLDR: i hooked up with a girl and my bf of 2 months broke up with me. How can I get him back?

Expanded: 

I (29f) need advice. I was dating this guy for two months and things were moving really fast and we were just really connected. We already had the exclusive talk, were spending several nights a week together, had gone on a few trips abroad, and had already talked about what we'd each want from a marriage, house, etc. 

Then one weekend when he was away, I went out with my friends. I got incredibly drunk and told him I loved him to which he replied ""better talk about this in person"" but continued on being extremely attentive and lovely as always.

I dont want to bore you to death with the details but the TLDR run up to this is that I had a lot going on, was on new meds, and shouldnt have been drinking. I rarely drink so I'm a lightweight anyway, so I was incredibly drunk. I was already feeling insecure due to everything else, and the lack of reply to ILY tipped me over. I ended up hooking up with a friend and going down on her. I immediately told him, and the next day he broke up with me. 

Just to add - nothing like this has ever happened before. I've never hooked up with a girl and I have never cheated. I had said to him that I was curious about it and we had talked about a threesome. I didnt do it for attention, to test him, nothing. I did it solely bc I had been curious about being with women and the opportunity presented itself and I did not think. I did message him about it beforehand asking if he was OK with it and he said yes. But then changed his mind the next day.

Since then we've gone back and forths where he says he misses me and wants to be with me but hasn't been able to forgive me. 

I know I am TA, trust me I have never regretted anything more. 

Question is, if this happened to you, what would it take for you to forgive and move on?"
"I’m a 24F trying to get advice dating a 26M virgin. I have been single for a 9 + months after being in a serious relationship for 5 years. The break up was pretty bad and the relationship was abusive. With the help of friends and therapy I’m doing better. Since about January I was kind of “spreading myself around” and as great as that felt I knew it wasn’t healthy and it was only fueling a bruised ego. However in March (before quarantine) I met Matt. He’s really sweet, attentive, and understanding. I didn’t realize how unhealthy me spreading myself around was until I started to self reflecting and talk to him. The more I got to know Matt though I found out he’s never been in a relationship before, and is also a virgin. He’s also really introverted and pretty anxious around me, but is also interested in me too. How do I make him more comfortable? Also how do I tell him I can wait until whenever he’s comfortable for sex? I really want to reassure him that it really isn’t a big deal and if I’m moving too fast or do anything that makes him uncomfortable he can let me know. 

Thank you in advance! Sorry for any grammatical errors!"
"My [M/25] recent ex [F/22] and I want to be friends So we ended our relationship about 2 months ago, I haven't really come to terms with it as I didn't take it seriously. Over the lockdown period here (6 weeks so far) she has been more certain about her choice, which I want to do my best to respect. We do want to remain good friends out of this, is there a healthy way that I can process my feelings and close this door? Would it be too soon to see her in person? Should we continue contact through this? (Video calling/messaging etc). Advice is very much appreciated. Thanks!"
"Anyone else not feel physical symptoms of crushes? I’ve never had a crush really, but when I know I like someone it’s more so some sudden interest, at least that’s how it was with my last partner. But even so, I didn’t start developing these symptoms until more than 5 months in. I don’t get sweaty hands, butterflies, or heart racing like normal crushes. So this makes it hard to identify if I like someone. Anyone else understand this? I think I might be emotionally detached but still I see this as a blessing and a curse."
"How to cope with my[21M] depression/feelings for a friend [21F] during the virus and university examinations. Any suggestions on focusing on my exams instead of these issues? I'm a virgin. Was getting really good at talking to girls/creating sexual tension, building a killer summer body, working on myself etc. Everything was going great and I was hitting my stride. Then the virus happened and all my progress slowed to a halt. I was really getting along with this girl (not my friend) and I'm pretty sure I would've ended up sleeping with her sooner rather than later.

I am super depressed that I can't do the things that I would like to do to improve myself cause of the virus and this is compounded by the fact that I currently have exams so can't even do home workouts as I don't have the time. I'm constantly thinking about when I will be able to get back into my routine and finally lose my virginity.


On top of all of this, I have a friend who I don't get to see anymore as I'm stranded in a different country. We talk all the time and I've developed some feelings for her (fml). I lied to her about me not being a virgin when we met initially at the end of last year (not sure if this is relevant but I didn't want to look like a loser so I lied). We usually have very flirty conversations that have now developed to mild sexting. We're still very much just friends, we're just very sexual I guess. It's all just a joke, if that makes sense. 

I'm thinking the virus will be around for a long time. I need a couple months after gyms open to get the body I want and can be confident in. I just feel like I am losing a lot of time and it will be a long time before I get laid. I'm also worried about finding a job after university ends at the end of this year. Haven't had much luck so far as I'm an international student at a top university in the UK and the prospects weren't great before the virus and they look abysmal now. I really like it in the UK and would like to stay if possible as I've made a lot of meaningful connections there. 

It's all very depressing and are the only things I worry about but I have so many exams (remote) and really need to focus on them but I can't.

Sorry for the rambling. I'm just not in a good place rn.

TLDR: got exams but can't stop thinking about how long it will be before I can stop being a virgin loser + other things."
"Should I still be friends with this person? I became this weird fwb situation with this dude. He’s 29M and I am 23F if that matters. It was honestly like the perfect fwb because when I want to do something, we have enough common hobbies that makes it’s easy. I do not have crush/love him by any means, but I am hurt by his actions and now I know longer want to be around him. I wonder whether it’s worth it to even pursue this friendship or straight up just end it. Well, we were supposed to go camping this weekend, and they were packing and told me that they’re about ready, but I started this thing that took about two hours to finish. He kept saying he can wait and I’m kept saying no you can just go since I knew how excited he was, but I also didn’t want him to wait, but I also did want him to wait because of course I love going camping. Well, he supposedly “decided” to go. He said he would just come back after tomorrow morning to hangout since he just wanted to test his new gear, but I kind of blew up I mean you know when you tell me to go, but you don’t really want them to go and stuff because the trip was like to hangout and test stuff so he shut his phone off. I took a bath and went to cool myself down, and I realized how much of an ass I was so I was hoping he hasn’t left yet so I drove over to apologize. His apartment is locked from the outside and stuff so I couldn’t just go in and apologize, but I did not want to go in when someone was leaving because I wanted him to at least come outside to talk I waited for about roughly 30 minutes. It was obvious to get a hold, and I also felt so dumb from waiting since I wanted to go apologize and it was just so hard and painful already so I went home and got my car ready to camp since I was supposed to drive. He has his own car so he was capable out leaving. He respond when I went back home saying I just want to spend time with his dog which I didn’t have a problem. I drove back after my car was ready to go camping since I impulsively drove to go apologize. I cooled off a bit, but still wanted to apologize. I took a more proactive approach and asked someone that was leaving the apartment if they can let me in. I shoot a text saying the thing I’m doing is done if you haven’t left I can go camping now because I already realized how much I ruin the situation, but I did not want to waste time moping around. Here’s the part that hurt me, I waited for another like 20 minutes either hoping that he was home to go camping or someone to come out to let me in. The later part happened and when I knocked on the door then he responded he was not home and left for the city even though I literally can hear him on the other side.. I mean I get the ignoring, but he just lied and I was just right there so I took off to cool down cause just getting that message. I even told him I could hear him from the door. After a couple minutes, I cooled off, I still wanted to apologize since I was definitely in the wrong earlier, but I also want to confront this new situation. I knocked on the door again so he’s like straight up blasting his music so I can leave, but I am kind of stubborn I just said I’ll leave when you talk to me. I went to go apologize and confronted the lie he didn’t say much other than was like I should of said I wanted alone time. I didn’t pester much cause I just went and gave a hug and said sorry. I was heading out since I got what I wanted to do. He wanted a longer hug and stuff, wanted me to stay, but not stay. I told him we can still camp, he said no he wasn’t in the state of mind. I went to get my keys and stopped me multiple times before I was able to leave. I asked him multiple time if he was ok and stuff he said he was and then he asked me if I was I said I was better, but not ok. He said I’ll see you tomorrow for a hike or something. I said I don’t know and left. I was still butthurt from the lie and we only met a little before quarantine. I just am unsure whether or not to continue this since lies are something that really hurts me. I know it wasn’t out of malice that’s like the worse part since I was part of the reason that resulted this person to lie. The friendship is still young which makes me want to end the friendship because the lie happen so early on. I have a tendency to push people away too. Anyways, should I continue this or no?"
"What made you decide to have children? Fiancée (32F) and I (32M) disagree after recent change. My fiancée and I have gone back and forth on whether or not to have children. Curious to hear why some people do? 

We had settled most recently on not having kids because
1) money
2) freedom
3) responsibility 
4) stress
5) current state of the world and America and social media etc

But today, my fiancée said she was leaning more towards the middle, and potentially having kids because
1) they’d be cute
2) we’d be good parents
3) they’d bring us joy 

I don’t think the first two are reasons to have kids. I don’t agree with the last one, or at least, don’t think it alone would outweigh the cons. Her dad passed away before I met him, and my parents and grandparents all got divorced in horrendous ways (primary driver: money).  

I think her mindset has changed because she recently became unemployed and I think having kids might make her feel fulfilled. 

I’m at a loss for what to do here and could use some other people’s perspective. 

Thanks in advance!"
"My (18M) girlfriend (18F) gets mad at me for playing video games at night. Everyday like clockwork I get on videogames with my friends at 11 PM. My girlfriend and I normally facetime from 8:30-11 and she gets upset at me for “leaving her”. She says she wants me to stay up with her on FaceTime. I play videogames with my friends, its not like im playing them alone. We also hangout multiple times a week for 10 hours each time. She says she wants more attention. I really enjoy playing videogames with my friends, but I also really enjoy my girlfriend. Advice? Input?

Edit: Also am I in the wrong here?"
"Should i cut my hair or not? (Family issues) I always wanted to have long hair, but my father and few other family members wouldn't let me. So now I've been growing my hair since last year. It's been a year. But i wanna have even more longer hair. My relationship with my family is not good, especially my dad, from childhood I've been the ""dumb"" child, blames me for the fights in FAMILY and with relative's. Insults me all the time. Never recognises me as a person who i really am. Always brags about money, like how many he's spending on me,  insults me because i wasnt able to find a part time job because there wasn't available.I'm 20(m), now he said that if i dont cut my hair he wont let me continue my university. I've been in depression since i was a kid because always i was left behind, the reason? Because i would always said it's okay, im fine."
"To have kids or to not have kids? my partner (23M) wants them, I (21F) don’t When we moved in together at the start of lockdown, he mentioned kids, said something about wanting to convert one of the day rooms into a bedroom for “when” we have kids.   

I don’t think I want them, I just want us to live together happy,  I don’t want someone else coming along ruining it. The thing is I’ve known he wanted kids since the beginning, because he’s just so caring, kind and paternal.  I just knew,  but chose to ignore it because he has such a beautiful heart.  But he’s also very manipulative, but not in a bad way, he always wants the best for me.

At this point he thinks I’m totally on board to have kids one day soon.  Even though I’m really not, but don’t want to hurt him.

Maybe I would be better off just having kids,  maybe that’s a better life choice and I just don’t even know it.  

Any advice for a girl at some sharp crossroads? :)"
"My (22f) girlfriend is amazing but so distant when we aren’t together (25m) When we’re together she makes me feel like I’m top of the world, very affectionate and loving. She has strict parents that only let her come see me a couple times a week which is fine. 
But it kills me how little affection and attention I get when I’m not with her, Especially because time I get to spend with her is limited by her parents.

She says she’s not always on her phone and will go hours without responding. I get it, I’ve tried telling her it bothers me that she goes hours without even giving me a heads up that she’s not going to respond for hours. Still happens at least once a week. 

Last night she stopped responding at about 10:30 and didn’t respond till 1am saying she was watching a movie with her sister. By then I had already texted her goodnight and went to bed. 

I don’t want to let my insecurities eat me alive especially if shes being truthful. But what can I do?

In the past I lived with my ex gf so I never had to worry about texting and calling because we were together so much. Dating someone I don’t get to see regularly and are bad about being on their phones is stressing me out. But I really like this girl more than any other girl I’ve dated in the past. 
Just don’t know if I should act on my insecurities or just deal with it."
"Should I contact my ex as he ghosted me during a 3 year relationship? So, summer of 2016 we met. Hit it off straight away and decided to be together about two months after initially meeting. This ended up being a long distance relationship as he was attending uni in a different country. Now, the relationship was amazing. Phone calls, texts and video calls. Surprise gifts every few weeks and I couldn’t ask for more. Due to our culture/ religion we decided that we were in this for marriage and wanted to be together as soon as he was done with university. 

Now come last summer, he completely stopped texting and calling telling me that he was stressed due to finals. I completely understood and was supportive and understanding of his situation so I let him do his thing. Days and weeks have past and didn’t hear anything back and even when I messaged him he wouldn’t even open it. So essentially we unofficially broke up. 

Few months past and I can’t seem to ignore the fact that the relationship I spent 3 years trying to make work ended without any closure. 

So, do I or do I not message him to ask why things happened the way they did or should I just forget about it and move on?"
"I think my Step-Dad (m42) is being biased towards me(f23) and giving his son(m27) special treatment Honestly just the way I see it makes me feel really depressed. I don't know if I'm over analyzing it or not. I hate it. 

I've noticed my step-brother doesn't have to do as much as me around the house. We're both dependents but I'm far worse off than him. I have been battle anorexia for years, I have little to no muscle mass, I'm anemic and to top it off I suffer from anxiety, depression and paranoia. I'm hoping maybe this is just the paranoia causing me to see things this way but I take on more chores than my step-brother and its really taxing. 

 Start with what my step-brother does, he takes out the trash, and does heavy lifting when required which isn't often unless the family is doing a project. He does some streaming and earns very rarely some donations of money.

I take care of the cats but because one is mine it doesn't count as a chore. I take care of the dogs but because one is mine it also doesn't count. One is actually my parents and they've never even bathed her, I do it. I clean my room but that's just expected of me even though my step-brother has never done that since we moved in three years ago. I clean my shared bathroom, again its expected of me. I vacuum when asked, I do dishes when asked, I sweep when asked and mop when asked. On top of it I'm a digital artist, I make money by taking on commissions in which I'm frequently in contact with my commissioners to see if the work is coming along to their satisfaction. But this doesn't count as a job to my family because it doesn't contribute to the family. Even though it's been enough to pay for my supplements which takes a bit of the financial burden off them. 

To my step-dad really my only chores is vacuuming, dishes, sweeping and mopping. My step-brother use to take care of the dogs which is a daily task but stopped after his own passed from old age. 

My sister, she doesn't actually do much either, she has an actual job, she takes care of elderly people and comes home to play games. But she doesn't help clean our shared bathroom. I don't give her much crap over it though since one of her patients has dementia and its extremely taxing on her. 

 Recently got into an argument with my step-dad because my sleep schedule is fucked as hell per-request of my mother and I didn't feel like doing dishes because I wanted to work. I saw my mom off to work early in the morning, saw the dishes were piled in a mountain in the sink. I was too tired and figured my sister didn't work today and my step-brother has no lifting to do maybe one of them will do it. Took my pills and went to bed. Got up 10 hours later and the dishes were still there. My step-dads first words to me were ""Do the dishes."" I was pretty pissed off because he didn't work either and waited ALL DAY for me to wake up just to tell me to do them. 

I can remember our argument almost perfectly. 

When he asked me to do this dishes I replied with ""I can't, I'm behind on work and I'd like to actually finish something.""   
He replied with ""You don't do much anyways.""  
Me: ""You have two other kids in this house that didn't do anything today.""  
Step-dad: ""I pay the bills, keep a roof over your head and feed you"" (He makes far less money than my mom and she actually pays them)  
Me: ""You do the same for the other two.""  
Step-dad: ""Your sister works.""  
Me: ""So do I and she didn't work today.""  
Step-dad: ""Doesn't count, it doesn't benefit the family.""  
Me: ""Sis isn't contributing either and neither does your son."" 

I walked away after that cause I just wasn't going to deal with it. My mom tried to push me to do it too while I was in the middle of working. She didn't push as hard as he did, she saw my points and left it at that. 

I know digital art isn't a very big deal to many or even a job but I take it very seriously. These are real people paying me their hard earned money for something they want me to draw. 

But today they wanted me to do dishes and I said yes but asked if my step-brother could be worked into a rotation. My mom said ""Sure, we'll starting a rotation for taking out the trash too."" If I'm taking out the trash too then I'm still doing more than him and I can't even lift the trash to begin with. If I had muscle mass I'd do it. If I wasn't anorexic and had the energy to build muscle mass I'd do it. But my doctor can't even figure out why I'm so under weight when I should be the size of a blimp.

Am I crazy? Is it just the paranoia? Cause I can get an increase in meds if it's that but I don't know what to do if my family is being biased towards my step-brother. It feels unfair, its depressing but I don't know if its them or me? I feel like I'm losing my sanity trying to figure out if its just the paranoia. If its not the paranoia is there even anything I can do about this?"
"(18M) I get jealous when My GF (18F), plays video games with her Guy Best Friend (18M) I've been with my GF for 3 years so far (Both 18), and for some reason I've been having this reoccurring experience . All 3 of us , are gamers , but with how life's been working out . I can only play until a certain time then I have to go to bed , while my GF and her Guy best friend (GBF from now on,also 18). Whose been best friends with him for longer than our relationship. can keep playing until, I'd say around 1-3 am. Because they're not as good as morning people as I am. So I see it as not being able to see my GF until noon, yet I feel like I loose her attention when nighttime rolls around and she wants to play the same game we all 3 play. 

Getting to the main topic , I feel jealous when either / I see them playing together and I'm not there / I'm in the same group call with them . But I feel left out. 

Me and her GBF imo havent had the best history. I've tried fixing this jealousy issue , I feel like it's a bigger improvement that years before . But I still have those thoughts no matter what I do , every single time my GF and GBF are in the same game / call . It hits me no matter what .

I'm asking for help on just , dealing with that emotion. Along with the question ""How do I deal with being in a call with my GF and GBF, but I come to know that I really do not enjoy GBF as a person , with their personality being annoying and saying weird / odd stuff that doesn't click with me . Yet it's sometimes the only way to talk to my GF without making her feel trapped and controlled."""
"What should I do? So me and my girlfriend have been all about each other ever since we first started dating, but now after a year and a half of dating, our conversations just become boring, repetitive and draining. She wants to have my attention all the time. I’ll try to play video games with my friends and she’ll text me and want constant communication or she thinks something is wrong.

Recently my dog of 14 years passed away and I’ve been really distraught about it and I wanted space so I can grieve by myself, but she wants to keep texting and when I don’t text her she gets super edgy and talks about crying herself to sleep. 

I still love her and everything, but I can’t be her only source of entertainment. Even before quarantine, if I wasn’t doing anything with her, she typically would just stay in her room all day. What should I do/say to resolve this cause I fear that I’m starting to lose interest in our relationship and that this is just becoming a chore."
"My (25/f) 10 year relationship with my bf (27/m) feels like the spark has died and it’s going to end... We started dating in high school. We’ve both never really seriously dated anyone else. 

We work together and used to live together (broke up for a few years and I moved out). We’re dating again but still living separately.

We see each other once a week or every other week. I go over to his place (bc im currently living with family and he’s in our house)

But it seems like all we do is have sex and work (we both work from home).

I don’t know what to do. We both love each other but it feels like the spark is gone. We don’t talk. I don’t even know what to say. We can never think of things to go... idk I just feel like if we keep going down this path, our relationship will fizzle our.

Any suggestions of bonding ideas?

I feel like everything I suggest gets shut down or work comes in the way.. I feel like all he wants is sex but he claims that’s not true. I just don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: Any ideas on how to reignite the spark or bond with your long term partner?"
"I (32F) have feelings for my boss (36M) that I think might be mutual. Is there a way to make a move without embarrassing us both? I recently started at a company (it's been a few months) and connected almost immediately with my boss-the owner of the company. I really liked being around him but didn't find myself attracted to him or anything. I was promoted rather quickly and moved around a bit.   

Over the time I've worked here, people have pointed out that I'm treated differently than others in my position. I seem to get a lot more face time with the boss, people who've hardly seen him comment how he comes around a lot when I'm working. He suggests a lot of in person meetings/lunches and we text pretty regularly. He's given me a few small gifts. A while back we had drinks and talked for several hours about work and personal stuff. At our next meeting he mentioned how much he enjoyed getting to know me. 

He's brought up how people in our line of work don't always work out when they try to date and it can be a nightmare. I know he's single but don't know much about his personal life otherwise. My gut tells me he's interested and so do my friends. 

So my question is: Should I let it play out slowly or can I advance this forward without embarrassing both of us?"
"Finally having second date - but it’s at my home and I don’t know what to do Sorry for the title - I don’t think there is a better way to explain this - I (25F) have been working from home for the last seven weeks. The guy (29M) that I’ve been talking to since the end of February has been in a similar situation. We are now able to have our second date, but since places are still closed he is driving to my city (3-4 hours away) to have this date at my house. 

I’m feeling weird pressure that we won’t have anything to do or that he won’t have fun and it won’t have been worth it for him to make the trip. 

We haven’t had sex and I won’t have sex with him on the second date regardless of the location. I don’t know 1) how to entertain him 2) how to make sure he gets the picture that sex is off the table despite his drive. 

Sorry if this isn’t the right place for this question but any advice would be great!"
"Stuck! My boyfriend (23M) and i (22F) have been seeing each other a while now, well a few months maybe 10 and the relationship is still fresh. When he messes up he gets really defensive and tells me he wants to kill himself if I leave him, but I can’t feel like this to stay with him. I try to tell him not to say those things, but he repeatedly does.. it’s not even my mistakes they are completely his and he can’t take any responsibility for it other than this. Help!"
"Scratching during sex I am (F 20) hes M (26). What would you think if you’re giving guy head and you guys are in 69 position and he randomly and slowly drags his nail down your back? Like idk how I feel about that, I have a long thin scar on my back now. Not sure if he was in the moment or what, that’s an usual act. He also bit my ass and left a bruise. I’m more understanding of the bruise rather than the scratch"
"Today I said goodbye to the girl I love for good Today I (24m) said goodbye to the girl (24f) I love for good. She’s truly the love of my life and I’d do anything to be with her. However, she’s starting a new life in a city I’m not in and she wanted to cut ties. It just wasn’t going to work. We ended things months ago but today was the final day we talked. We decided it was easier to say goodbye than drag it on. I feel so empty. 

I miss her and love her so much. I told her I loved her a lot and she expressed the same to me before we said goodbye. I just feel devastated. Any advice on dealing with this loss in quarantine? I love her so much"
"How do you get over an ex who has moved on already? (And general breakup advice) Got out of a relationship a little while ago and me and the guy have chosen to stay friends because we do both care about each other a lot. I want the best for him and have *minimal* hard feelings about how it ended and the relationship in general. 

I kind of knew it would end because he wasn’t really looking for a relationship to begin with so it was doomed from the start, but we did end up falling in love and being together. However, we’re both just at such different points in our lives and there were some other problems and fights that ultimately lead to the end. 

Like I said it’s been a little while now and I decided I want to be single because I jumped into this relationship immediately after my relationship before that, and that relationship was really toxic for my self esteem and mental health and I didn’t really deal with any of that before getting into this relationship. I want to actually learn to love myself without needing other people and do all that self improvement shit. 

Now for the dilemma I’m facing.

He wants to be single so he can “explore his options” which is fine I know I don’t own him and I do want him to be happy so I’m not upset with him for wanting that. However, I just feel really hurt because he just got over everything so quickly. 

During our relationship he told me that I’m the kind of girl he’d want to marry and that I’m the first girl he’s ever loved, but then we ended things because he says he’s scared he would cheat on me in college (I’m gonna be a sophomore in college and he’s about to be a freshman). He also said that he hopes it works out for us someday and that it’s like a right person wrong time situation. (I don’t really like it when he says that because he knows how much I love him, and that by saying that he’s giving me all this hope that we’ll ever have a future) 

He started talking to other girls almost immediately after things officially ended. I think he already has a new girl he likes too and I’m just here feeling really shitty. I still love him but I just feel really defeated and numb to everything. I’ve still been crying when I hear songs that remind me of him and I still try to be there for him but it just sucks. He wanted to keep having sex with me too on top of him “exploring his options” but I told him I’m not comfortable with that. I don’t know what else I need to do to just get rid of these feelings. I know we won’t have a future and I’m trying to be realistic about everything but I just think of him and I miss him so much. 

I just feel like I’m watching the person I fell in love with fall out of love with me, and in love with other people and it’s happening so fast. And he’s told me that he just likes the validation that other girls give him but that just makes me have feelings of “why wasn’t I enough” 

I’m looking breakup advice in general or if you’ve been in a similar situation and have any advice that would be great. I do want to be single for awhile since even though this makes me sad I do feel significantly happier than when I was with him (confusing I know), but I’m just not ready for something new."
"I really need advice on a manipulative girlfriend. She tried to jump out of my car repeatedly tonight and now playing victim and threatening to press charges from me having to pull her into the car from trying to jump &amp; holding her in the car. Please Hey reddit, i need some advice on how to handle this situation. My girlfriend of one year is twisting around an incident and threatening to press charges. Here’s what happened: 

Me and my girlfriend have been together for a year as of last month. I won’t go into crazy detail, but she has mental issues and ADHD and she is prescribed adderall for the ADHD but nothing for her depression, anxiety, etc. 

So the other day her grandfather died. She went to the funeral today. So she’s definitely under a lot of stress and mental stress and depression. I get that. She says she wants to go get some liquor. In the past relationships have caused problems in our relationship, including her getting physical. But I put it aside bc I know she’s hurting inside. I ask her if getting it will help make it better, or just make it worse. She gets upset and starts getting an attitude and claiming I’m being her dad and treating her like a kid and going off on a tantrum about how her family went out for drinks after the funeral and one girls husband went on a liquor run for her and my girl said she wishes I was like him. I told her I never said she couldn’t drink, but that I wanted to make sure it wasn’t going to make things worse and make her mental state worse. Anyway I told her we could go if she thought it would help and she got dressed. I told her I was worried still and that we can’t spend a lot because we don’t have much money. She stormed out of the room after calling me some names and telling me to shut the fuck up. My mom sleeps on the couch bc of disc problems in her back and the front door is right by the couch. My mom has a bad headache and passed out on the couch. My girl doesn’t care and storms outside and slams the door. Of course this wakes my mom up and she’s mad and comes and tells me that my girlfriend needs to apologize. 

I go outside and she’s by the car and I tell her that was uncalled for and when we get back she needed to apologize to my mom. She went off on a tantrum again saying she’s a burden and all she does is wrong and she just fucks everything up. I just tell her to get in the car and we will go and she can calm down on the way. As soon as we’re in the car she’s calling me names again and when I try to talk she tells me to shut the f up over and over. She refuses to buckle up. I told her we won’t go if she doesn’t. She hits my dashboard and starts cursing and yelling. As we’re driving down the road (it’s a small country dirt road, middle of nowhere, about 4 miles from my house and it’s pitch black), she’s still going off and I tell her I don’t think drinking is a good idea with the mind state she’s in. This really sets her off and gets to the bad part..

She tried to jump out of the car. She unlocks the door, puts her foot out and then her whole upper body. I’m going 40mph, there’s a car behind us and coming at us and it’s night time. So I quickly grab her and pull her back in. She starts going ballistic and hitting me and keeps trying to jump out. I’m not exaggerating when I say I had to pull her in 20+ times. Between these times she would start punching me and grab the wheel and yank it and try to put my car in reverse while driving. At this point i held her while I turned around and headed back home. But as I keep having to pull her in I’m grabbing onto anything I can to stop her from hitting the pavement face first. Eventually I say enough and just grab her in an almost rear naked choke but on the collarbone instead of the neck and not choking her of course. Just tight enough she can’t try and jump. I tell her I’m not doing this and its probably over. I tell her that this is not going to be one of those situations where I try to leave and she threatens to kill herself and she says yes it is. During the ride home with me holding her she’s trying to punch me in the face. Eventually I let go bc she tried to grab the wheel and she thrusts her face against the window and she acts like she’s unconscious. I tell her I know she’s faking and I’m going to call her mom and tell her what’s going on and she immediately jumps up and starts hitting me again. I make it home and get out and I tell her I’m calling an ambulance for her. 

She calls her mom and starts telling her that I trapped her in the car and kept grabbing her and hurting her. She didn’t add in why I was grabbing her. I start yelling so that her mom can hear me on the phone why I was grabbing her and my girl is pretty much telling her mom to not believe me and to come get her. I call the ambulance so she can talk to them and try and go get some help and she just sits at the end of the driveway calling me names and threatening to press charges for assault. 

She agreed to go to the hospital. She has bruises on her neck and a few other places from where I literally had to grab and pull her whole body weight back in the car all while trying to keep the car on the road. She’s telling all her friends and family the story that I trapped her and was hurting her and she was scared for her life. She hasn’t told anyone what she did. I messaged her mom and best friend and told them the full story, but I knew they’d take her side but I had to get the full story to them to defend myself. 

I just need advice on what to do. She’s threatened suicide the last time I tried to leave. She constantly manipulates the situation and plays the victim. I know I could have handled things better; but in the moment I was more worried about not letting her jump. And she kept trying and also trying to wreck the car. 

She does have some bruises. If she presses charges, could I get hit with assault or domestic violence? Even if I was trying to help. I just don’t know how to handle this kind of suicidal manipulation and playing the victim. Any advice would be appreciated... thank you..


Also, I know some people would say why i didn’t stop and just let her out. The reason is my road is very busy. And it’s Friday night and my neighbors down the road throw parties every Friday and they usually drive home and back and forth pretty wasted and fly down the road at 60mph+. Plus it’s pitch black. I didn’t want to let her out bc she wouldn’t of got back in. She would of sat in the road and with her being suicidal I didn’t wanna risk her getting hit. On purpose or not. I just wanted to get her home so I could call the ambulance. 


TL,DR: Girlfriend of a year got upset in the car, tried to jump out 20+ times and grab the wheel to wreck the car. I had to grab her each time and pull her into the car and eventually held her in a weak rear naked choke on the collarbone without choking so I could get her home. She would hit me when I let her go. Called an ambulance when we got home and she went to the hospital but threatening suicide if I leave. Also threatening to press charges for the bruises from me having to grab her by her body weight when she was jumping and pull her back in. And also by the ruffle of me trying to hold her and get her to stop punching me while driving..

Did I do the right thing?.."
"Am I wrong Hello my girlfriend and I were out drinking with friends one night everyone was having a good time and then out of the corner of my eye I see her grab my friend by the face and kiss him and I just wanted her to leave me alone so I heas to the back yard to just be alone and I start rolling up a blunt and she comes out back and starts asking me to talk to her and I just keep asking her to leave me alone over and over I just wanted to not flip out then she starts raising her voice at me and touching on me so I just tell her to leave me the fuck alone 

Then she of course goes inside making an even bigger scene and cries in front of everyone then I ended up getting kicked out at almost 1am and wasnt able to come to my house by 5 fun fact it was raining and cold as fuck I sat at a park freezing cold

Well the next day I made a tinder because honestly who wouldnt feel hurt as fuck after that and I guess I just wanted her to feel how I felt so I just started swiping till I got a match texted her called her cute and that was about it besides wyd and then just felt guilty so I deleted it 

But a few months later she claims I cheated on her by doing that am I the one who cheated? Am I wrong for doing that? I just get really hurt over shit like that and she claims ""it wasnt a big deal hss our friend"" any time ive ever brought it up"
"i (20f) saw my bf (24m) for the first time in over a month and don't know what to do I've been with him rather off and on for two years. he is openly manipulative and prides himself on it. He's addicted to substance abuse and I'm constantly worried if i stay with him i'll end up either having him steal all my money on drugs (as he's used me for drug money before) or i'll fall down a rabbit hole with him.

When we last ended (around august last year) i ended up abusing substances to cope and ended up meeting a girl (27) and we started openly dating. he reconnected with an old friend (23m) who he calls his soul mate and best friend. now the girl has left the country and we don't speak often. his friend is moving to live with him in the foreseeable future where they plan on dating as they already love each other. This in itself doesn't bother me but I've had a lot of similar circumstances turn sour and been cheated on by a lot of partners in recent years. bf and his friend (not yet bf?) have both said they want me and him to end up together. I don't know if i could handle it.

When I saw him I did not experience any of the love I would used to feel. But whenever we've ended before (I've always ended with him for being abusive and using me as a money source) I end up very unstable and often binge on things like tattoos and substance abuse til I talk to him again.

I can't talk to him about my substance abuse issues as he overlooks them as he is far more addicted to them than me and he hates who I had access to them through.He doesn't talk to me about his abuse issues which just causes distrust and i found out he's still been getting high every other week throughout the past month and a bit.

I don't know what to do as I don't think I love him anymore but don't know and don't want to slip down a slippery slope as I have before. What could I do?"
"I’m caught in a struggle at the moment. Does he like me? I’m confused. And over 30 lol Hi guys. Here’s the long story:

I met this guy, D, over on this website called Feabie (dating for plus size women) I wanna say, over two years ago. It was really cool seeing him and being so close to where I live, it sounded like a good match. We hung out and went on a few dates, and spent a good time in his house and obvi slept together. 

Fast forward to a really crazy time in my life where I was pregnant (from my ex at the time) and didn’t know it (yeah I know I know) — and then boom, all of a sudden he wants to forget about me. I understand why. I mean, it’s crazy. I know. 

Fast fast forward. The thing that really confuses me is, we kind of made up and we saw each other one time after I had the baby (about 4 months after the ‘split’), and I apologized — ad he seemed to get it — and it seemed like we were going to go out again. Only we didn’t and it seemed like a lost cause. Then we saw each other again this past winter, thought we were going to go out again — and yet, he got himself a girlfriend and just wanted to ghost me it seems. 

The thing that confuses me is, why is he still on Feabie? Why does he still check up on me after all these years? And could he still be attracted to me? He made few attempts to contact me. 

Just wondering what your thoughts on this is — this is my quarantine question. Lol"
"One of my favourite childhood toys is racist and I’m not sure what to do with it Soooo if you haven’t guessed it’s a golliwog. I’d forgotten that I’d had one until we went through some photo albums and it’s all come back. 

I got it with my now deceased grandparents after I had picked it out because I thought it looked cool. I called him arthur and brought him everywhere for a bit and he’s in a fair few pictures which now makes me cringe. 

I asked my parents if they knew it was racist as they’ve said they didn’t see it as bad then - but agree now that it’s straight up racist. At the time they thought it was merchandise from the Black and White minstrel show which my mum had fond memories of watching when she was very young and didn’t think much more on it. For reference, we’re from a very rural part of the uk where there a) was basically no diversity and b) there was no knowledge about different cultures until very recently so I can believe that at the time they didn’t clock that is could be really offensive. 

Any ideas of what to do with it? I don’t want to get rid of something I really loved and reminds me of my family, but it having it makes me feel uncomfortable knowing all it represents."
"(18)F I’m not comfortable with my boyfriend (18) seeing nudity. I have horrible trust issues I can’t get over. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years now (I think). 

To start off, I was never insecure about this type of thing in the beginning of our relationship. In the beginning I’d be comfortable with seeing nudity in any sense including porn. I never cared if he watched porn or anything because I had no problem with it. Then, 2 months into the relationship, I noticed a girl taking an interest in him. I laughed and asked him “hey what was with that girl that was so thirsty for you?” He laughed and said “I told her to fuck off because I have a girlfriend” and that was the end of it. The next day I asked him if she ever replied to him and he said “no I blocked her” and then we moved on. But later throughout the day I had this gut feeling that something wasn’t right. He had given me access to his instagram and I always told him to not worry because I would respect his privacy and never look, and I never ever did, up until that point. Something inside me was screaming check his dm’s. So I did. My heart shattered. He never blocked her. He never told her he was taken. She sent him a nude and he replied “wow I’ve never been sent something like that before~” which was a lie because I sent him nudes before. He said to her “Ngl I’m an ass guy” with a heart emoji. They had been messaging throughout the day. I wanted to vomit. Even now it makes me want to rip out my heart because it hurts so much. I immediately called him and asked him in the calmest voice “hey, you blocked her right” he said “of course I hate thots” and it was like I’d been stabbed. I told him I read his DM’s and he said “I’m sorry, I was planning on telling her but I forgot because I didn’t want to worry you.” His excuses were “well i didn’t tell her to send nudes, but I didn’t exactly tell her not to.” and “well I didn’t know what to say”. I was so heartbroken I yelled at him and said “you say you have a fucking girlfriend”. And I cried and cried and had never felt so much pain in my entire life. Nothing like that had ever happened to me. He cried to me and said he was sorry for being so dumb and told me he understood if I didn’t want to be with him anymore. After that we eventually made up but I’ve never felt the same since then. I made him unfollow every suggestive model and told him to delete anything that had any female nudity in it. He did because he wanted me to see that he doesn’t need to see any other woman’s body than mine.

Now to the present. I have the worst trust issues. I’ve accused him of cheating countless times. I constantly ask him if he still thinks I’m attractive. I constantly ask him if he’s been in contact with any other girls. He tells me countless times how much he loves me and thinks I’m beautiful but even then it never feels like enough. I’m constantly worried he’s secretly talking to women behind my back. It’s to the point where I’ve lost sleep over worrying even after years later since that incident happened. I’m incredibly self conscious and it feels like torture thinking about if he’s lying or not. He’s lied to me numerous times even after wards. For example it was around 9pm and he said he had to go. I asked him why and he said he had schoolwork to do. I had the EXACT same gut feeling I had when I found out he lied to me about that girl. I told him I knew he was lying and to tell me the truth. He immediately said “I’m actually going to talk with a guy about a commission I don’t know why I lied it was stupid to lie about”. That broke my trust even further and made me question what else he’s lied to me about. At this point I’ve become so restless with thinking about if he’s with another girl I feel like I’m genuinely going crazy. 

Right now, he’s changed his views on a lot of things. What I mean is, he believes masturbation is unhealthy and porn corrupts your mind. He’s uncomfortable with anything sex related, including with me. We’ve been long distance for a while now, and we would always have phone sex. But he hasn’t wanted to be intimate with me at all since September of last year. Of course, it makes me more insecure. He rejects all of my advances because he says he’s stressed out with school and home life. He never flirts with me anymore or does anything romantic besides tell me “I love you” and “you’re cute”. 

Onto the nudity problem. Because of his lack of any sort of sexual attention to me, I’ve been even more upset about anything that has nudity. Even if it’s just art or in a video game. Hell, not even just nudity. I have a problem with him even looking at any girl online. With his previous lies and his lack of intimacy it’s driving me absolutely insane with worrying about him looking at other girls because he won’t even look at me. I’m incredibly insecure and I feel like my heart is being shred into pieces. I just don’t know what to do anymore. He says that when we’re going to be together he promises me he wouldn’t be able to take his hands off me but with how things are now it’s like, how long is that going to be? I’m constantly asking if he loves me anymore and he assures he does but. No matter what I can’t stop crying every night. 

He tells me “I’m not trying to be mean but you need to be more mature about it. I’m going to see nudity on the internet even if it’s unintentional. It’s in the past”. But no matter what I just can’t get over it and move on. 

Please, any advice is appreciated so so very much. I sincerely thank you for reading all of this. 

TLDR; boyfriend cheated on me, lied numerous times about small things, now I have horrible trust issues and self consciousness."
"How do I get my boyfriend to be more romantic? We have been dating for many many years now and have been living together as well. To be fair, he is very affectionate but never does anything romantic. He used to in the past so I know he knows HOW. I feel like he just feels like he doesn't have to try anymore and that being affectionate is enough. I feel bad that him being affectionate isn't enough. I can't remember the last time he made a romantic gesture. I want to feel wanted. I've talked to him so many times about needing him to make an effort and he gets upset and apologizes and promises that he will try. Then months and months go by and nothing. I want to marry him some day, but I don't know how to get through to him at this point. We have communicated our love language to each other too and I try to be his type of romantic as much as possible, but I feel like I've been giving but recieving nothing. Should I just drop it? Am I being immature for wanting some romance? Do relationships usually lose the romantic factor? Do you think romance is a big deal? I just want the pit in my heart to go away..."
"My fiancé(m35) won’t buy me (f25) 70$ engagement ring so his family said I should buy it myself. Is that cheap? Writing this, I am not with him anymore. His sister told me to buy the engagement ring myself and ask me why I am so dependent on him? Last time he hit me with an iron but I was in his parents house, and of course, nobody was gonna be willing to be the witness. His sister said that I was a good actress and very good at crying. Many things happened that got me to the point that I cannot take it anymore. He once gambled all of my tuition so I couldn’t register that quarter. His sister is a dentist so she always calls me stupid, idiot, crazy, etc. I have never seen such a stuck up person like that. I never talk back to her because she is absolutely not worth the time and hassle. I know dentists that don’t talk to people like that."
"My(21 F) partner(29 M) tell me he loves me but he won’t touch me So we’ve been together for about 2 1/2 years, and I’ve put about 20kgs on from being around 60-65kgs, I’m 5”6 so I’ve got height. Anyway the more time has gone on and the bit of weight I’ve gained my partner and I have had intercourse less and less often, I think we’ve done it twice maybe since the beginning of the year. He tells me he loves me(and still likes me) but I can’t help feel that for the both of us not having that connection can’t be good. I love him dearly but I feel like sex is a big part in a relationship, you need to be attracted to each other. He doesn’t really cuddle me or that either, I try to have hugs and cuddles but he eventually literally pushes me away. He just says he’s not “really affectionate”. 

I guess I’m just asking for opinions on this, is he just being a prick for not accepting my body or is it my fault for not trying harder to get back to 60-65kgs? I do and am trying to loose weight but I’m not overly unhappy with it, I just don’t know what do to. 

I apologise if I don’t have enough info or anything.  
Pretty new to reddit. Thanks guys."
"I (23F) started talking to someone new (25M) two days ago and it's going so well! Maybe too well.

For starters, I recently got out of a rollercoaster ass relationship about two months ago. Though realistically the craziness ended today (I hope). I was completely uninterested in any romantic venture because my heart and mind are tired.

Of course though, things come when you least expect it. In comes new guy from a Facebook group. I messaged him and man we hit it OFF! We have the same tastes in music, same politics views, similar cultural backgrounds and experience (Slav diaspora), he's a successful music producer in LA and I'm a vocalist (not by trade), same sense of humor and from the surface of the personal stuff we scraped we seem to really relate. Oh not to mention he's really cute. 

I'm afraid I might be falling too fast because I'm trying to rebound but I really don't think that's the case as I've pretty much ignored and been completely apathetic towards anyone's attempts of grabbing my attention. 

I haven't enjoyed such a conversation, or really anything, in a while! A breath of fresh air after months of drowning in depression.

My question is, should I really slow down? I personally believe in diving in and seeing what happens no matter what. Last relationship was an example of how it can go bad as it pretty much crashed and burned. I don't regret it though. Maybe I'm afraid of ruining this lovely chance but I learned a lot and know what I need to really focus on.

Going to video call him tomorrow! Really looking forward! Thoughts?"
"27F, this is my third attempt to have a real healthy relationship. 1st abusive, 2nd didn't work out and need help to identify if 3rd time is a charm. What red flags should i be looking for? I'm 27F pansexual, my first boyfriend(29M)(abusive relationship), ended a year ago. I fell in love with a pretty woman at work on January she is lesbian 22,  we flirted a lot and kissed, eventually I confessed my love and tried to take her out to dates, but when it got serious she told me,  she was still in love with her ex, a couple of days later they were a thing again. 

That's it. I had sex with my first boyfriend, but it was either borderline rape or rape. Never had  sex with a girl, but I know it's something I would want to do, if a start a relationship with a girl. I feel like I don't know what's a real healthy relationship.

And now, there is this guy(29M) l met sometime ago, he is bi.  We are getting to know each other, lately. He said, that once quarantine is over he would like to take me out on a date, I told him about my past experiences, he seemed very supportive when it comes to my abusive relationship, but when the conversation switched to my experience with girls he was kind of sacarstic. e.i ""are you dominant or more submissive when dating girls? Oh.. sorry what do you think you would be?"" Then he told me about his sexual encounters with guys and how they are different from straight relationships. I felt invalidated for my lack of experience.

Maybe, I'm reading between the lines things that are not there, but I'm not sure what king of red flags I should be looking for. I'm going to therapy and apparently I have low self-esteem, therefore issues to analyze myself. 

Basically, I need help to identify red flags and if you all don't mind, ask me questions that you think will help me understand or identify if this new relationship is a good idea.

"A troubling friend group Hi so this has been happening for a long time but I never did anything about it. 

So M (13F), C (13F), L (12F) and I (13F) have hanged out together for around a year. As we became closer, they noticed that I was an easy person to tease/bully. They also know that I’m a sensitive person but keep continuing to tease me.

Recently, they’ve started teasing me for everything. For example, if I text something, they’d respond with something like “wow why are you so vague itaxvi?” Or “So ambiguous itaxvi.” 

A few days ago, we played a snapchat game and I kept killing C. C was very upset and even started crying. I thought it was funny and I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. Now she and M and L keeps telling me to apologise to her for it.

And today they started swearing at me as a joke. They kept repeatedly texting me “fuck u itaxvi”. I feel uncomfortable with it and want them to stop doing it. But if I just say that, they’d tease me for being too sensitive and if I say it assertively, they’d tease me for being aggressive.

Today, M also posted on Instagram and I just commented a hi and her, C, and L started attacking me by saying “fuck u itaxvi”. I laughed it off and just said something similar to “guys why are you cyber bullying me”. M replied with “fuck u itaxvi, nobody cares if you’re cyberbullied and fuck you!” Later C replied with “YEAH YOU KILLED ME 10000+ TIMES AND STILL DIDN’T APOLOGISED YET.”

I want them to stop it because I feel like they are bullying me. Am I just overreacting? How should handle this situation? Should I deal with it until I get back to school so I can tell them to stop so they’ll start talking me seriously?"
"How to move past a break up in equal terms Hi, so this quarantine has really put a strain on my gf and I relationship. In the end I fucked yo bad which was the final straw. I admit I messed up but we both agreed it would be best to move on. This honestly only happened a couple hours ago. I’m upset Bc I know I fucked uo her big day. Idk if I’m upset about the whole break up though or not. I have really been pushing this off because I never wanted to upset her and I was relieved she agreed but I don’t know  I feel upset as of right now and I don’t know why."
"I think my(22F) husband(32M) is too protective of my cousin(19F). How should we handle it? Context: We all live in a East Asian country, a bit more conservative than Western countries (not much, however).  Me and my cousin are locals, my husband is European.

There's a club quite renowned for being attended mainly by tourists. Local girls interested in foreign men go there (not necessarily to have sex with them, often only dancing and fun). It's mainly because they're afraid having sex with a local guy would affect their ""reputation"" (large social circles here) while foreign tourists will go away in a short time. However, around 10% of girls are sex workers so it hasn't a good reputation around here.

I met my husband in a completely different situation, I've gone there only once with a group of friends and I didn't like it. I don't like going to clubs at all, to be fair!

Like you could imagine, even here girls having one night stands are labeled as ""easy"". My cousin has been there a couple times and wants to keep going there. I won't do it, but she's free to go if she wants, I told her this in a kind way.

My husband was much more worried. He told her it isn't a place for a young and successful (excellent grades) girl like she is. He points out how these tourists don't care about her and only want to have sex, if she really likes foreign men he could make her meet one of his friends or relatives interested in a serious relationship. My cousin said to appreciate how much he cares for her but she's strong enough to care for herself. I suspect she didn't expect him to react this way, however.

I explained him what he's wrong about:

I won't engage in casual sex, but other girls want. Especially young people shouldn't judge them for this.

She, like other girls around the world, could simply want an occasional experience every few weeks with a guy she likes, without the intention to meet him another time. Maybe foreign tourists won't respect her much, but neither would local guys. And local guys remain here and talk to other local people with the risk of her family knowing about it. I also convinced him to apologize to her about the ""I can present you some European man looking for a serious relationship"" thing. Asian countries aren't as poor as in the past, our families are quite well-off and his words remembered the infamous mail order bride thing. He realized it and called her to apologize about it, but he still thinks she shouldn't engage in shallow relationships.

I like how much he cares about my relatives, he's showing is really part of my extended family, but maybe in this case he's gone too far. He's not and he wasn't a young local girl, so he should weight his words and advices more carefully in my opinion. He said that's true, but he knows what European (or broadly speaking Western) men going to that club are looking for.


TL,DR My cousin sometimes engage in one night stands with foreign tourists, meeting them in a club with a relative bad (somewhat deserved, but truly exaggerated I think) reputation. I told her I don't think it's a good thing, but I'm happy if she's happy and she's free to do it. My husband, on the other hand, is pretty vocal against it, saying she should stop doing that."
"How to forgive a cheater If you stayed after being cheated on, how did you recover?

Edit: I know the common advice will be to leave, but I want to hear from people who survived it and built a better relationship afterwards. Statistically, most couples stay together after infidelity. If that is you, I would love to hear your story."
"She broke up with me 2 months ago and now she's texting me about why i don't call or text her. 
Some context first.
My Ex broke up with me because of my 2 female friends
she met a couple when we starting dating. Saying that i need to stop talking to them and so.

So yesterday she texts me saying 
"" i hope you're doing okey  i noticed that you don't ask about me or about how I'm doing, i didn't do anything wrong to you. I feek that you hate me because we broke up ""

The thing is i don't hate her or feel anything toward her what's done is done.
How should i answer her ?"
"Telling my parents I want to get engaged Hi guys. So I posted before about telling my parents I want to get engaged to my bf end of year and I didn't tell them yet. I'm thinking about telling them today. I'm really anxious about this incase they are against it. Anyone got some last minute advice for me? I'm praying to God this goes well. I'm a responsible 23(f). When it comes to my relationship, I always think about my decision carefully and logically. Idk if they see that since I had drama with my ex. But my current bf doesn't deserve to be compared to my ex. He's way to good of a person and he had his share of family drama recently thats over and done with, but got spread to my family. I'm trusting myself now with my current decision and I have a gut feeling I'm doing the right thing."
"My (27F) boyfriend (26M) has been self harming since January. I just found out. Some backstory of course, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a little over a year now. We moved in together in February. I knew he was having issues with depression since around Oct/Nov of last year. We’ve definitely had our issues, he’s lied a lot, and I’ve ended up saying mean things due to the pain it causes. He started his first attorney job about a year ago. I try my best to be supportive but the job really takes a toll on him sometimes. In March I saw a few scratches on his arm, and because I know he struggles with depression I became alarmed and asked him what they were, he convinced me they were from getting out of his car in the parking garage, when he has little room to exit.
Yesterday we were on our way to a little camping getaway and he wore a short sleeve shirt. His entire forearm is covered with scratches. I asked him again, he tried to say it’s from the door. Then admitted that he uses a key to cut his arm when he’s overwhelmed with emotions or if we have an argument.
I don’t know what to do. I keep going back and forth wondering if I’ve caused this by getting upset at times where he’s lied/wondering if I’ve been a bad girlfriend. I finally got him to use a website for therapy a few weeks ago but he uses it only occasionally. He’s so nonchalant about it. I asked him to tell a family member and I know that he probably won’t. I’m upset that he lied again, but I can also understand. I’m scared for him and I don’t know where to go from here. If anyone has dealt with self harming, or has a loved one who did/does this, I could really use some advice on how to handle it. Thank you!"
"I have no teeth      I have become very passive. I have become a huge people pleaser. I've made mistakes in my marriage and my wife doesn't trust me so I have given her all power over me. Coworkers push me around and it feels like they can nitpick me with no push back. 

     I thought I was being the bigger person and not letting my emotions make me mad, but I feel I have suppressed my feelings to a point they cannot fuel me when the need arises. I feel emasculated. 

     I am declawed, yet I feel these supressed emotions and feelings are not gone. I feel they are locked down and if they break free it will be something those around me will deem ""out of character"" for someone so ""level headed"".

     I want to feel free.

     (Just to be clear I have no thoughts of harming myself or anyone, just really fucking feeling beaten down... and I'm using mobile so the formatting is probably fucked)"
"How do I (17) improve my relationship with my parents? I don't feel like I have anything in common with them (like hobbies, or interests) and I don't feel close to them. They aren't the ones I would go to seek comfort or get advice. I don't hate them either though.

I also don't like spending time with them because I feel like they bring out the worst of me. I always get irritated when we're talking.

Things like me interrupting them or filling in a sentence if they struggle with finding the words isn't accepted, but they can do the same without consequences. Sometimes I have called them out for doing that and then I just get to hear things like ""I knew what you were going to say anyway and it's irrelevant to this discussion"".

Or like if they start talking about something and I make it clear that I feel uncomfortable and don't want to talk about it, and they keep going, sometimes I just say it clearly that I don't want to talk about that, and then they're like ""you can't control what other people are talking about, the world isn't about you"" or ""you can't just decide when I have to stop talking"".

I can't talk like myself when I'm around them, it's like I have to use another programming language to communicate and still it doesn't work well. The conversations feel so stiff with them. I have told them really personal stuff about partners I had relationships with or about my dreams for the future and that didn't go well. Like my last partner they didn't like, they were like ""how can you see a future with this person, \* studies philosophy!"" and they made it really uncomfortable at the dinner table when \* was visiting.

Another example, I've recently started taking dance classes and I've been stretching every day for the last weeks, so I can get my splits. And when I told them about it, they told me I was too old to get flexible or to become really good at dancing. Everything they say is just so discouraging and it kills my motivation.

They moved to this country when I was a baby and I don't like it here, I want to move abroad when I finish high school. When I told them that they thought of it as a personal attack since they have moved here just so their kids can have a good childhood in a good country and now I'm ""throwing their hard work away"".

They do encourage me though to talk about my problems with them, they say they don't like being left out. But I've stopped doing that and now they blame me for our shitty relationship. They complain that I'm always in my room etc. and they say I lack social skills. I have a lot of friends though and I never fight with them. I feel like other teenagers understand my language somehow or my way of communicating. Interrupting a friend sometimes isn't a big deal and sharing your opinion with them isn't seen as a personal attack.

I don't think they are abusive, but they do give me bad self-esteem and I don't see them as role models. I don't feel like I would gain anything by keeping the relationship when I move out, but at the same time it gives me feelings of blame. They aren't abusive or toxic (maybe in the reddit-standard they are though) but they don't contribute anything to my life either.

What should I do?

Hope my english works well enough btw"
"My Father Was Killed by the Police and His Family Blames my Mother. What Should I Do? I'll first start this story by background on everything that happened, this is a really long story but I need help. I'm the middle child of my family. My Mother got pregnant with my older sister (who is 7 years older than me) when she was 15 with my father who was 24. Obviously a fucked up situation but it was never taken to any authorities. My father already had a kid with another woman before he met my mother, I'll call him John (he will be relevant to the story later). So my father and my mother stayed together to take care of my sister. 

They ended up moving out together when my mom turned 18 and things got worse from there. My father began to abuse my mother as they lived together in an apartment. This happened off and on and my mother stayed with him despite this. Later when my mother was pregnant with me, he would still abuse my mom from what I've been told. I'm not sure the full extent of the abuse because I dont want to know. When I was 2, my little brother was born. I have a few memories of us as a family and him as a father not being so bad. I remember watching cartoons with him and playing with his action figures as he was intrested in comic books. While I have some memories of him that are good, the ones that stand out are not. I remember many times in my early life my mom and dad yelling and me being scared and hiding. I know this has deeply effected me today as when people start yelling I start shaking and breathing really heavily. My mom was scared of him during a conflict and called the cops. My father was arrested and charged with domestic abuse and was sent to prison. 

So for the early a period of my life he wasnt around. I'm not sure how long he was in there for but I know it was a large chunk of my early life. Then my dad was released and told my mom that he found God in prison and was a changed man. So he lived with us again and things seemed fine as we went to church and my mom wanted to make it work. Well regardless of his new finding of god he began to abuse my mom again. My mom was done with the abuse and told my dad she didnt want to be with him and kicked him out and got a divorce. My father didnt want this and one day he asked her to come to his brother apartment where he was living to talk about the situation. This was a terrible situation as he had a gun and threatened my mom's life if she didnt get back with him. My mom was able to escape and call the police to handle the situation. I'm not entirely sure what happened from then but my dad ended up getting killed by the police. 

Before he was killed my father's mom constantly made fun of my mom but other members of his family were nice to her and didnt treat her so bad. Well all of that changed when my father was sent to prison, and things only got worse when he died. They completely stopped talking to any of my siblings and me as they blamed my mom for his death. My sister was 13, I was 6, and my little brother was 4. His death destroyed my family even further as my grandpa couldn't handle his loss and killed himself months after my father's death. It's clear that from these events they hated my mom and we were left without half our family. I still have my mothers side of the family but many people have died throughout the years. I only have my grandma and three uncles left from her side of the family. After my dad's death my mothers family really took care of all of us and tried their hardest to be there for us. 

Throught my life always yearned for having a complete family and was always curious about his side of the family despite what they did. Years passed and found my half brother John as I mentioned earlier on instagram. Years pased since my father died and I wanted to try to reconnect. I gave him a follow request and he messaged me asking how all of us sibling were. I didn't really think through my actions that much and just acted. My sister who experienced the true nature of my father hated him and his family for what they did. Well a meeting was set up for all of us siblings to meet at a restaurant to see what would happened. My sister did this for me and didn't want to reconnect with them. Things were fine as we caught up on that event and nothing was brought up about my mom.

I wasnt sure about the whole thing but I deeply wanted a complete family. Months later my half brother had a kid and we were set to meet at his house. My sister and I went without my little brother this time as he didnt want to be involved. I met my baby nephew and all seemed well. We were set to then later meet all the rest of my dads family. I have some fond memories hanging out with my aunt and uncles from when I was a little kid. I wanted to have a family but I realized my sister really didnt want to talk with them and was only doing it for me. I didn't want to put her in that situation anymore and we still havent set up a date to meet my family. 

My sister however much she hates them wants to be there for my nephew and not abandon him like they abandoned us. My half brother still texts us every now and then saying that we need to meet up some time, that whole shit. It's been a year and a half since we met up and idk what to do anymore. I want to have another part of my family but idk if I can forgive them for what they did. Should I stay in contact with them to do it for my nephew or let it go and not talk to then again?

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this post, I know it was really long."
"I (26m) found out my boyfriend (30m) has been taking care of himself instead instead of me. Sorry for how long this will be. The two of us are very similar, we've been together for 5 years, loving together for 4 and half. We have everything in common, likes, Dislikes, food, hobbies, everything. Except one thing, that's bedroom activity.

I'm a bit of a hypersexual, I could go everyday if I was given the chance. He on the other hand is hardly ever in the mood. This has caused some turmoil through the years. Me making too many advances, and large time spans in between times we do stuff together. I have been trying hard to curve my nature, doing things for him, like back rubs, and keeping it strictly non sexual. He's says I've come a long way, but it doesn't seem to have changed anything.

It has currently been a few weeks since the last time. Last Monday we had to take him to the emergency room. We thought he was having a heart attack from his conditions, but it turned out to be extreme gastro acid reflux. He was given medicine and has been getting better. Ever since then I have been waiting on him hand and foot, back rubs, stomach rubs, cooking, cleaning. I've been trying my best to do everything I can to help him get better. I've even tried to not make any advances what so ever out of respect.

Until last night. He was complaining of his back hurting. I offered a massage, I did his whole body. He ended up completely naked but completely flaccid the whole time. I didn't make any moves, and avoided it intentionally to show him that I just wanted to help. When he said he felt better that's where it ended and he got dressed, nothing happend and I could deal with it. 

The two of us have never had issues using each other's phones, nothing to hide so why not. We use whoever is closest when we need it. Last night he left his sitting in the bathroom and went to bed early. I was playing my switch when I went to the bathroom and needed to look something up for a quest. His phone was there, no problem. Until I open up his web browser to a bunch of porn tabs. This struck me as unusual, he has said repeatedly the last week that he's not in the mood for anything. Against my better judgment, I decided to look through his history.

That's when I found that he has been watching porn almost every day the last few weeks. As soon as he wakes up he has a session before leaving for work. And then another session half an hour before I get home from work. This infuriates me because despite how hard I'm trying, it's like he's going out of his way to not be in the mood when I'm around.

It's not like I'm in to anything terrible or phsycially straining either. He could literally lay there doing nothing and I'd be willing to do all the work. I've been stewing over this the last 24 hours. I feel guilty for looking through his history, I feel angry for feeling undesirable, I feel conflicted on if I'm overreacting. I can't bring myself to bring it up to him but not talking to anyone has just made me more angry and resentful.

TL:DR
My boyfriend says he's never in the mood and we go long periods without activity. Found out he's been having porn sessions everyday the last few weeks just before I get home to avoid being in the mood around me. I'm angry and unsure of I'm over reacting."
"My girlfriend isn't affectionate Hey, I've been on the app for a while now but this is my first actual post so I hope I can get some answers because my mind has been all over the place. Me and my girlfriend has been dating for almost a year and 4 months now. Ever since the beginning pf our relationship, I've complained to her that she doesn't show me the affection that I need. She doesn't kiss me (unless I kiss her first), she doesn't say I love you (unless I say it first), shoot we barely even cuddle at night. It bothers me so much because every single relationship I have been in, there was ALWAYS a honeymoon phase where we couldn't keep our hands off of eachother for the first 5-6 months of a relationship. I complain about the lack of affection atleast 3-4 times a month and her answers always varies almost like its excuses. For example, the first time she said that our room was dirty (clothes all over the room) so I said I could understand how that could ruin someone mood. So I started cleaning up, she would be affectionate with me for 2 days and then she would go back to her old ways. It's at the point where I don't even touch her at night because im so used to her denying me. Its always something. I try not to talk to any of my friends about me and her relationship because I feel as if relationship issues should be kept within a relationship but I feel like ive been losing my mind. Everytime I try to explain this to her, she keeps saying ""not everything is about sex"" and it makes me angry cause I agree. Everything isn't about sex and I want more from her than just that. I just want to feel wanted. I just want affection. I dated a girl for a year and we had ZERO sex because she was waiting for marriage and I did perfectly fine because I was shown consistent affection every single day from her. We've also been living together for a year, we've been together every single day. So it's hard to see someone I find so beautiful and attractive and have to act like you don't want to love them. Im tired of holding back love from someone I really do love. But this is really bothering me. Any suggestions?"
"Dealing with postpartum depression I (24f) had a baby last year on July.
My partner (28) started to arrange our home to live as a family. However thing did not work out as planned and we ended up living with my MIL (64) and my SIL and her sons.


I was used to live alone.
In a small town.
In a big ass house, owned by my father.
And now I have to live in a small crowded space.
And now we are quarantined


I used to go to college, and work, earned my own money and had the right to buy what ever I wanted.
Now I have to ask for money and to see if we can buy stuff.


I m breastfeeding my child so I can't work or finish college, I am not a good housewife at the eyes of my MIL.


I clean, and I cook when ever the chance is given.
But still I feel like I'm not good enough.


My MIL is always telling my the things I do wrong and how she used to by with her husband.


I feel like I haven't accomplished any of my goals
To  get married
To have a degree
To get  a job in my career
To have my own home
 Because I had a baby and now my life is just sad


I can't return to my father's house.
Cause I have a family now.


What can I do to feel better?

I can't stop crying from the impotence that I feel
I wish that I could just  take my child and leave. But I don't have anything to offer him.
I want to get my independence back and run away.
But I can't."
"Boyfriends insecurities are ruining our relationship 24f) boyfriend (26m) and I have been dating for about 2 years now and for the most part every thing has been fairly normal. We get along great and he’s a very kind person but he has a tendency to be a bit self absorbed. I have endured a good amount of sexual abuse in my life so sometimes while we’re having sex, I can get triggered and I have to stop. He never had an issue with it and respects my boundaries but recently he’s started taking it personally. I stopped having sex with him for about a week and a half because I mentally wasn’t able to go through with it and he made it seem like I was making it up to get out of having sex with him. He’s like “Are you sure you’re really triggered? Am I just not good enough/ are you not attracted to me anymore?” I don’t want him to feel bad and I am sympathetic towards his insecurities but it feels like he’s making it all about him. I reassured him that it wasn’t me making things up and that I would never do that but he didn’t seem convinced and I decided to just drop it. A week has gone by and things (like our sex life) are normal again. So, this morning I received a vibrator as a gift from my best friend and I thought it was funny and genuinely sweet. I showed my boyfriend and he was not into it at all. He glared at me and asked me if she sent it to make him look bad. I told him no and suggested that we use it in bed and he got genuinely upset with me?? He told me he refuses and that if I want to use it that means he’s not enough and that I’m being greedy. This is too much for me and if it wasn’t for quarantine I would definitely stay at a friends for a couple of days but obviously that’s not an option. I don’t even know what to say to him anymore. I need help.


TL;DR Boyfriend is majorly insecure and thinks I am making up being triggered during sex due to past trauma to get out of having sex with him. How should I handle this?"
"I simply don’t want to even argue anymore My boyfriend (23M) is great. I (23F) love him but I can’t even bother anymore. 

I don’t know if I’m just depressed but I literally do not care enough to even mention things that upset me. When small disagreements happened I would normally just give him a heads up — ‘hey babe I feel this way when you do this because of this and this and I just wanted to talk to you about it’. I just have no patience, will, you name it, anymore. I barely even feel upset anymore. 

I don’t care. Plain and simple. And it’s not like I’m putting my feelings asjde because I want to avoid fights and protect his feelings. I simply, honestly, do not give a shit about how he acts and what he does and in the rare occasion something he does actually upsets me, I don’t care enough to communicate. 

Is this normal? What could this mean? He is a great guy and I like him but I’m afraid my apathy towards him/communicating is a sympthom of something deeper I can’t quite put my finger on. Or am I just depressed?

TLDR can’t bring myself to care about how my boyfriend makes me feel and don’t bother communicating anymore. Deeper problems or just plain ol depression?"
"Is it safe to say that our FWB M (26) and F (25) is going some where? I’ve made previous posts about this guy before, we are on Month 5 of messing around. 
Now we have stayed the night together,  not always had sex, we grew up together as kids into high school and reconnecting now 8 years later.
He told me in the beginning he didn’t see himself having a girlfriend. But we still talk like it is a relationship and we help each other out. 
Here is the tricky part, he went down on me F(25) and usually from what I hear guys don’t just do that to all girls. But I figured since we have been going on for this long , I shouldn’t be surprised.
We cuddled and he’s like talking to me (sober) saying to me you deal with so much about me. He’s cuddling me and kissing my neck at the same time. He even left  love bites.   We would hold each other all night. I spent the weekend with him and we just talked and connected on things. 
I myself just got out of a marriage a couple years ago . I’m not looking for anything serious myself , however , I don’t know if this is a potential relationship and could be worth a try. That he and I are over seeing. 
He even gets nervous around me when he has a haircut he thinks is bad. He would say these music stars are hot or sexy.  Then he would look at me and apologize, I respond with I agree she is hot! 
Like honestly, I’m a super chill person, I don’t get jealous over stuff like that. He sometimes apologizes a lot.  We both are interested in the same things and sexually compatible. 
Even at the clubs and bars he would say we are together to get guys to back off. 
If this isn’t serious then what is this? I feel like at the same time questioning this will drive me crazy too. I feel like a part of me should go with the flow. Any advice?

TLDR; we have been at this FWB thing for 5 months, we explored a bit more in bed, not all meetups are hookups. Sometimes we just cuddle and hang and relate. Should I just go with the flow and not worry about labels?"
"do i love him? I (21F) can’t figure out what’s going on. I broke up with my bf (21M) of two years about a month ago, he is my absolute BEST friend but he was doing nothing with his life. found myself becoming more and more depressed being with him since all we really did was smoke and play video games, as well as I cleaned up after him; making me feel like a babysitter. I told him I needed my space and was planning on moving away but I may not anymore. I talked to him about how I was feeling, that he needs to get his act together and he promises he will. I like having my freedom and being able to talk to new people but he still talks to me almost every day. I love to talk to him, even hangout sometimes because we always have so much fun, we’ve hooked up a couple of times since we broke up but he said he wants to get back together. he said he can’t be just friends with me so it’s either we get back together or I lose our relationship all together. I’m not too sure what to do. any advice??

ADD ON: I love how he treats me but another thing i’m struggling with is that I find myself looking at other men, a lot more often lately, as selfish and horrible as it sounds I don’t really enjoy his body? personality is so much more of a priority to me than looks but recently i’ve been struggling with his which is part of the reason why I think i’m looking elsewhere."
"Ex (that is now my friend) constantly brings up other apps I was on before replying to them, or asks me what I was doing if I took a while to reply. So I kind of have 2 questions here. One, would you guys feel annoyed by this too? And two, how should I go about this entire weird situation?

My ex and I broke up a while ago. Like a few months. Just in case it matters, we’re both 18 and I’m the F. 

Now when we were dating, my ex has always been clingy. I was fresh out of a breakup when we started dating, so this was perfect for me. A couple of months later I realized that this wasn’t what I wanted, I wanted someone with a little more individualism, so I broke it off, and we’ve decided to be friends ever since.

So there are 2 things that he does that kind of annoy me, and I was wondering if I should bring it up to him, how would I do it.

Number one, let’s say he texted me 20 minutes ago. I could check Instagram first and if you guys didn’t know, if you’re active on Instagram, you get a green light next to your name in your DMs. If he happens to be active at the same time too, I almost instantly get a dm saying something like “smh check ur snap” or “imagine leaving me on delivered for 20 minutes”. I just find this kind of weird, like I don’t have to text you 24/7. Anyways….

Number two, maybe I’ll stop texting him for a few minutes (usually no more than 30), and maybe while I’m gone I’ll go on Instagram to text someone else. I’ll come back and he asks me what I’ve been up to, I tell him, and he either gets upset that I was on my phone and didn’t text him back (and say something like “wait I texted you at 7:24. Then your insta says you were active 7 minutes ago, so what were you doing these past 7 minutes that you couldn’t text me back?”), or if I’m talking to someone else, he gets a little upset that I didn’t take 10 seconds to shoot him a text too.

So yeah, any insight on those two questions would be great. I’m not sure how to go about this without being mean."
Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who had a problem with opening up? Did it get better with time? Did they actively find ways of trying to deal with it for example if it was due to past relationships or previous trauma? Did you have to help them with it? Or did it not get better and they just couldn’t open up to you specifically?
"Didn't feel anything during sex [17F] [18M] I lost my virginity last night to my boyfriend (it was his first time too), he's lovely and I care about him a lot but it was the first time we had been together and able to do anything sexual, and I didn't feel any pleasure at all. Not from fingering, or oral, or PIV.  The sex only went for about two minutes and I could hardly even feel that there was anything inside me. He was adamant that he'd be able to pleasure me and make me orgasm when we were talking about it over text, but now he's pretty upset he couldn't do anything, even when I reassure him it's what I expected.  But now I'm rethinking if I even want to be in a relationship at all and what I'm getting out of it. Will I ever be able to feel anything? Or should I go and have some more sexual experiences with more knowledgable people, or stick with it and keep trying with my current boyfriend? I don't know what advice I'm really looking for, I'm just overwhelmed and not sure how to react.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm not looking to cheat or break up with my boyfriend over this. I'm 17, and it's my first relationship, so if it doesn't last for any other reason, I'd like to know if being with other people would be a helpful solution"
"Me and my friend won't stop arguing So this story has 3 people included in it
Me/ I
E (a girl my friend has feelings for)
D (my friend)

So D introduced me to E and later that night we played some xbox and me and E became friends really quick and were making eachother laugh a lot. Which I think made my friend jealous 

Then D messaged me the next morning basically starting an argument with me. And I got really angry because of that.

Then we all played xbox again 2 days later and I was making everyone laugh again and my friend half way through said to my other friend. ""I think Me and E like eachother."" Which started another argument. Now to be honest I do kind of have feelings for her and I think she likes me aswell but I would never ask her out cause I know that would hurt D. 

So I went to D's house yesterday cause it was his birthday and everything seemed to be normal again but later on he started an argument again.

And I just think that ever since D introduced me to E we have been arguing a lot but I don't want to stop talking to E cause she's my friend.

Is there anything I should do?"
"My(F18) bf(M18) is friends with a girl who cheated on her bf with him My bf has a friend who whilst in a relationship let him feel her up. She is the only girl in his friend group and when we met it was uncomfortable as I often found her staring at me and liking me up and down. 

My bf loves me a lot and I trust him. He’s told me she doesn’t like her current relationship which is the one she’s been in for years now and that she wants to end it but just hasn’t. I come from a family where all of my aunties and uncles and my own parents are divorced due to their spouse cheating on them. My dad repeatedly cheated on my mum and I saw how it crushed her. 

I trust my bf, although I find him accepting her offer to touch her inappropriately whilst she was dating someone else repulsive. However I do not trust that she won’t try and make a move on him due to her being upset with her own relationship.

Are my feelings of distrust to this girl validated? And should I distrust my bf if he was an accomplice to her cheating in the past?"
"Need opinions on distance girlfriend and a gift for her So my (23M) and my gf (21F) are long distance for the time being and I’ll spare the details since I don’t know if they are too relevant.
We met in college while she was studying abroad in my home country and we’ve been amazing since. I truly love this girl and want to spend the rest of my life with her. 
She has a very specific place that she always says to people that it’s her favorite place in the world. It’s a hidden ocean view cliff I took her to and that’s when our relationship sparked. The memory and emotions associated there are very near and dear to her. So, distance has been difficult and she’s been having a hard time so I wanted to get her a gift to remind her of how much I love her and to cheer her up.
I’m planning to get her a ring. It’s a simple band and I’m guesstimating the size and also including a necklace chain just in case it doesn’t fit. The ring itself is simple but the outside will have exact coordinates to this favorite location and an engraved message on the inside (don’t want to give it away since it’ll have her name on it). I also am going to write a letter for her in her native language and send it along with this.
I just want some opinions and thoughts on whether or not she’d actually like this or if it’ll seem weird or gimmicky or something. 
Any advice or thoughts? Thanks.

Edit: I’ll be sure to make sure the meaning is clear in the letter so there isn’t any misunderstanding behind it. That specific ring is quite a ways away from now and I realize how easily this can be misinterpreted. Thanks for that insight haha"
"My friend (25F) and I (25M) made a fake Snapchat to get information from my ex girlfriend’s (22F) about to be new boyfriend (22M), he is sharing her nudes in exchange for my friend’s. Do I tell her? This guy gave me a lot of red flags. I want my ex to be happy but I could tell this guy was sleazy from the start. We live in different countries so English isn’t their first language. We would go on there and ask questions about who he is seeing and he finally admitted to talking to her, though they haven’t been able to see each other because of quarantine but they have been exchanging nudes. He offered to send pics of her in exchange from my friend’s. I know it’s questionable what my friend and I did, but with this information do we send it to my ex as a precaution?"
"My ex/friend/SO [F24] and me [M24] just can’t seem to get along We’ve been together since 16 and at one point we’re engaged, but just so many things have happened that caused us to break up but we’ve never really stopped talking or should I say I’ve never stopped trying.

When she wouldn’t talk to me I’d drop off flowers every week on Friday. 

Recently we decided to try to be friends and things were okay... 
I took her to a really high end restaurant, bar and movie date. Gave her flowers still every weekend, I created a dinner date night and bon fire at my house where we got to play games and make dinner together.
I bought her gifts for her birthday.
but a lot of things bothered me, she wouldn’t let me be apart of her instagram and left me blocked. I’d invite her on FaceTime dates and she’d say she’d want to but never show and I just couldn’t really get her to spend any time with me so I said I didn’t want to be friends one day.

Ofcourse I didn’t mean it and tried to make amends, but it’s been impossible to talk to her. 

These last 3 days I ended up sending her the giant box of forever roses, a handmade leather journal with her name inscribed, and a nice necklace. I would ask her can we please talk, she might respond 6 hours later but usually just a roundabout way like “I was doing this with my family” and go.

It’s driving me crazy, I just want to communicate with her cause I feel like then we would be able to amend and accomplish so much but she won’t.

Part of it may be my fault I do push, and I get anxious and when she refuses to talk I try and try and try and try. Maybe more than I should, but I just don’t get it.... why won’t she talk to me? I’ve been her best friend for so long, and now it’s like I’m nothing....

I know I should probably stop talking to her but it’s 100000000x easier said then done, how do I fix this? How do I get us to get along and communicate and move forward?"
"Want to be friends with a girl but feeling shy and thus can’t approach her There is a girl living in my neighborhood. We see each other quite often but don’t know each other. I have looked at her and she has also looked at me several times. I don’t love her but I want to be friends with her.  She is an attractive girl. I barely know anyone in my city except my parents, teachers and a bunch of classmates. I don’t know anyone in my neighborhood. How can I approach and be friends with her? I really need a friend where I live because I feel like isolated most of the time. I’m a good-looking guy with glasses and she also wears glasses. I’m really shy and don’t know how to talk to her. Please give me some advice. Thanks in advance! 

PS. I have been living in this neighborhood for slightly more than a year, and we’ve seen each other since I  moved to this city. I’m 17, if that matters."
"My (18/F) brother (20/M) tried to walk back into my life after leaving for 4 years So my brother and I met like 7 years ago. We are half siblings (by dad) and kept separate until, well, 7 years ago. He lived with our dad and his mom while I chilled with my mom and my other siblings. He was an only child so he really wanted a sister his whole life while I wanted a sibling that wasnt at least 6 years older than me. We grew so close to each other so quickly. I hate affection but for him, I would literally crawl into his arms in the middle of the night whenever I stayed at his place. He was the same for me. We both had a soft spot for each other. 





3 years aftering meeting, I was sent to stay at his place for a month. I was tired of the constant fighting at home so my dad took me in. My brother started changing. He was always so down so I had to try my best to cheer him up. Then he took his issues and put it into anger. I get it, that was how I coped with depression my whole life. What sucked was that he knew how vulnerable and fragile my mental state can be. Especially at that time. He took his anger out on me and sent me down a whole depressive spiral. By the end of the day, my brother would apologize to me. And then he would do it again, and again, and again. It was a cycle. By day, he was a pure asshole, looking and hitting my soft spots. By night, he was a complete teddy bear again. 






By the end of the month, my dad sent me home. When I said my goodbyes, my brother was still in a mood. He didn't even look at me. That was the last I ever saw them. After that, it was just around 5 months of silence. Then coffee dates with my dad, who would ignore me when I asked what had happened. The coffee dates were monthly until we drifted off and it just stopped. Then soon after, I lost a close friend to suicide. Then my stepdad got aggressive towards my mother but that ended already. I normally would have my brother to help comfort me and say it'll be okay. I spent my whole childhood up til the age of 14 being on my own. My siblings were adults and already moved out so they werent much help. I spent my whole life like this, hating myself for not being able to find someone. To have someone come along and then just leave just made me feel like I will always be stuck this way. 







He came back recently. My brother literally knocked on the door (after 4 fucking years) and tried to convince me to let him in. Eventually I gave up and just let him inside. He tried to explain to me that he was just worried and getting scared. That he knew that some intense family drama was going to come up and that people were going to be aggressive if I stuck around. I was so confused and pissed because did this guy really not think to at least explain it to me instead of making me feel abandoned? And also, we have phones. We can literally just text and call without me being there physically. 





He left his number and said that if I wanted to go back to him, he'd be happy to let me. A part of me wants to go in. Another part of me is scared and worried that he is just gonna do it again. I would love for things to go back to the way they were but I don't know if it is really possible. He left me when I needed him the most. I am worried that he is just making excuses so he can get away with this shit. I really dont know what to do."
"My [20M] girlfriend [20F] is never interested when I try to initiate sex. Hi guys, I just need some opinions and advice on this. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year now and recently it seems like she’s not interested when I try to initiate sex or anything remotely sexual.

For example, we will be cuddling on the couch together and I will kiss her, she will kiss me back but never more than a smooch or two. I even try to kiss her again but she will often move her lips and put her cheek in the way. Also, I might hold her or grab her and she plays it off as a joke or sometimes gets annoyed.

Only recently has this happened, we used to have sex often and tease each other and she enjoyed it. I want to bring it up but I don’t want it to seem like all I’m interested in is sex. I just feel like we’re losing that type of connection."
"I (M40) dont know what to do Like the title said, idk what to do, im male in my 40, sorry for my english, not my first lenguage.

My birthday was on late march, one week before that, my mother died, and my world become a mess, because in my place was the coronavirus, all ok, i made myself and start to become happy, and could remember her without sadness in my heart, because i thought i had the best gf in the world, supportive while she wasn't gaming, but i didnt care about that because it was when i went to sleep, well... After 3 weeks my mom died, i realize she was cheating on me, saying to other man that she loves him, and she said she didnt do anything more, idk but i have the feeling she did, because of the words she uses ""i didnt do anything"" and in other situation ""it doesnt mean nothing to me""

  


I feel betrayed, and hurt a lot, enough to give me anxiety, and start to taking pills, that didnt do anything on me, or my sleep.

  


Im trying to forget and forgive but i cant, even with the time that passed. And here become my question, could i ever feel less pain about this? I start to feel im losing my time, specially because she keeps playing the game, more often now. And told me that she is not agree with dump the game or the people she knows inside."
"How do I tell my wife I disapprove of her behavior? She has Social Anxiety and takes criticism poorly. My wife doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom.

I don't like this. Especially when she wants to stroke my beard and such afterwards.

I tried asking ""Did you wash your hands?"" after she came out. She said no, got annoyed, and washed them, then told me I was mean and I don't have to remind her like shes 5. She didn't talk to me for the rest of the night.

She began washing her hands for about 2 days after that and then stopped again.

I tried having a rational discussion about it and tried to tell her how uncomfortable it makes me.
She broke into tears and told me she feels like I don't love her because I keep criticizing her, then evolved this meltdown into a monologue about how awful of a person she is and I should leave her. She stopped talking to me for 2 days.

She rationalizes she doesn't have to wash her hands every time because she doesn't touch her pee or poop. But I feel this is a weak argument.

She is a nurse and should know better, I think.

She has been in mentally abusive relationships before and has a beaten-dog personality now, for example, her mannerism of apologizing for anything and everything, no matter how unrelated or small it is.

How do I gently correct her behavior to wash her hands after using the bathroom without her feeling attacked and mentally breaking down?

Or am I just completely out of pocket in wanting to change this about her?"
"My parents makes me feel bad about myself and I don't know how to express that to them Not sure whether this is the best place to post but I'll try anyway. 

So I (18F) and my mum (48F) generally have a pretty good relationship but she makes me feel insecure about myself a lot. 

She used to criticise me all the time about not exercising which is fair because she just wanted to look out for my health. So over the lockdown I've started doing an hour every day walking and half an hour on my dad's exercise bike, which has improved my body a lot. I was never fat and I barely eat anything so I wasn't unhealthy, just not very fit.

 However today I joked about my thighs being wobbly despite all the time on the bike and rather than comfort me she said ""because you dont do enough toning exercises you need to tone"". Again I know she's just trying to look out for me but the comments are chipping away at my self esteem constantly after nagging me to exercise and now I started exercising it's the ""wrong exercise"". 

She had been nagging me to do other things during the lockdown so yesterday I made some brownies by myself from start to finish without her hovering over me and she said I burnt them. They were slightly burned on the very edges but if you cut that off they were fine. Then she went back on her comment when my dad (45M) came home from work and said they were really tasty so I didn't really know how to feel.

I've been criticised about other things as well like not eating enough/eating too slow, showering too quickly, being too clingy (asking for hugs too much), not doing uni work (my uni has stopped giving me work), and loads of other things. I know both my parents are trying to help and have my best interests at heart, but sometimes it really hurts me and when I try tell them that they say I'm being too sensitive. 

I know it seems trivial and not important but it happens a lot and it really chips away at me and makes me feel bad about myself and my body. They complain about my lack of self confidence but I feel like it comes from them.

I don't really know how to ask them to stop whenever I do I'm just being sensitive. They are concerned because I'm on anxiety tabs and I bite my nails down to the nail bed and pull my hair but the criticism doesn't seem to stop. 

Sorry for how long it is and if it's in the right sub or not feel free to point out a better sub if you have one. 

Thanks:)"
"My (24f) bf (25m) and I have been together almost 5 years and I don't know if I he's as invested in me as I am in him First things first, I love my boyfriend. That's just a fact.


I recently got off hormonal birth control, BC, because I knew it was affecting my mental state. I was generally unhappy and I could never seem to get to the peak of the emotions I had in high school. I thought this was just a part of growing up, but very clearly it's not. I'd spent a cumulative 3 years on it off and on in the span of 5 years. It's changed the way I feel immensely. I have a lot of hope and confidence and have the ability to fight for what I believe in again.


That said, it's making me see my relationship with my boyfriend in a new light. I don't think he appreciates me or thinks that my needs and wants are as important as his. It's hard to condense a 5 year relationship into one post to give impartial information about what matters here, but I'll give it a try.


He has a lifelong condition that isn't really the reason why I'm questioning things. I say ""really"" because while I don't care that he has the disease, it might be the reason why he acts the way he does. 


The first year, we dated casually and we both had other people we were seeing. I never mentioned my hookups, but he couldn't seem to stop himself from implying he was seeing people. That didn't really bother me, but maybe I was just failing to see a bigger issue. He had this really huge desire to impress people and maybe he thought that I would want him more if I thought he had options. I've since asked him to stop mentioning his exes that he just had to talk about all the time, and he's stopped for the most part.


Then I caught feelings. I wanted to stop seeing him because we'd talked about how we weren't ready to be monogamous, so I thought the best thing was just to stop seeing each other. But he said he was willing to give monogamy a try and that we did. 


Things were smooth sailing for quite a bit, but when things started to get more serious, I started noticing things and I brought them up with him as they came up, but things have never really changed. First, he was and still is pretty selfish in bed. I wasn't a very sexual person so at the beginning it didn't really bother me, but now (probably BC related) I don't want to be in a situation where I have to convince someone that I deserve pleasure.


He spends a lot of time in his head just thinking about things all the time which I don't mind. I think it's good to know what you think and feel about stuff. But this means that he never notices anything. He doesn't notice that dishes are dirty, or that he left the bathroom light on. I've been calling him out on this for years at this point, but he only just started to change this a bit. I think being on BC made me quite insecure about what I deserve so I didn't push on it too hard and now maybe he thinks it's ok to push those boundaries. 


We don't technically live together, but he was supposed to live with me temporarily while he found a place to live closer to his job. I have a studio that's quite expensive because the housing market is trash so there's not a lot of space for us right now. But he hasn't made any effort to find a new place. He was recently hospitalized (not pandemic related) so I get that it takes some time to get over that, but he's so bad at making a timeline and committing (or at least trying) to it that I'm not certain he'll get it done without months of dragging his feet. 


He's accused me of cheating on him at least 3 times seriously and is quite insecure about that in general. The second time, he woke me up in the middle of the night accusing me of cheating on him with a high school acquaintance I was reaching out to for help with housing. I was very depressed at the time and I showed him my texts with the guy to get him to come down. I have never cheated on him and I never will.


He won't plan dates. Or he will ""plan"" them and won't follow through. For example, after years of asking him to plan something (and yes, I've been the planner in the past), he ""planned"" a dinner for Valentine's day at a restaurant that of course would be packed on that day and thought we could have just walked in. 


Then there's the issue of my birthdays and other days that are important to me. He has never done anything for my birthday that I would consider kind of on par for what a birthday merits, which is the other person taking the time to focus on the person whose birthday it is. For the last one, he bought tickets for a musical we had to miss because he had to run an errand he just had to put off until he literally could not anymore and it of course coincided with the date for the show. He didn't go to my college graduation and didn't go to my company's winter parties. He has a lot of anxiety about getting me fired from my job, but won't seek help for that.


I've tried getting him to come home (a 3 hour flight) to visit and meet my family a few times. But he just won't commit to a plan that's more than a day away.


There's other things too that have been on the back of my mind when he had to go to the hospital again recently and I had time to enjoy being by myself again. I didn't have to remind someone all the time to pick up after himself or clean up. I don't want children and I don't want to be treated like a mom.


I don't think that my boyfriend is a bad person. He has been there for me through really rough times, but I've had to convince him that I'm not ok before he'll help. I've been letting things slide for so long that I'm not sure if I'm overreacting now that I have less hormones in my body. I know that I can be judgemental when people don't have skills that I find simple and easy to do, so I'm not sure if that's what's going on here. Are these things that people just have to learn how to do after years or are these things I should expect from a partner?


TL;DR: After years of hormonal birth control and stopping, I'm starting to think that my boyfriend is not as invested in me as I am in him. Am I overreacting?"
"Should I just give up? My [19m] girlfriend [20f] is in love with someone else even though I still love her. My girlfriend has been growing distant from me in the last few months, and it's not just because of our state's ""stay at home"" order.     She's been sharing a house with a bunch of other guys since September.  

We had a rough patch in September, but since then she has grown to resent me.  Afaik, she is in love with someone else she can't be with.  I wanted her to come over the other weekend and she blew up on me because she was sick of watching my roommates and I play video games while she was stuck doing nothing.  She was sick of doing what I wanted to do on our free time off while being too chickenshit to do the stuff she liked.  That was when she said that she wanted to dump me.  She says she can do better than me.

I don't want to do that.  I love her.  I really do.  She was this funny, nerdy, kind of dorky girl when we met and now she wants to dump me?  But now she doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore.  She won't even respond to my texts any more.  

Should I just give up on her even though I still love her?"
"did my brother sexually abuse me as a child? I’m 20 now and for the past two years since I lost my virginity at 18 I’ve never enjoyed the feeling of sex. I’ve never been able to climax during sex.  I’m gay and have tried being the bottom and the top.  I’ve tried many different positions with all different kind of guys (age, race, build, etc).  Sex to me is an outer body experience.  During sex i’m thinking about literally anything else and even when I try to focus on the person and the feeling I just zone off.  Sometimes i’m thinking about literally nothing at all just zoned out and waiting for it to be over.  I never stop because I want the other person at least to finish.  For the past year I thought maybe i’m bisexual or straight and like girls but have never really been sexually attracted to them like I don’t ever see a hot girl and want to fuck her.  I’ve never had a relationship with a girl that was more than platonic so the idea of me being bisexual was really confusing me.  It wasn’t until this past week that I thought maybe what happened to me as a kid has something to do with my current sexual experiences.  It sounds dumb but I really thought that what happened was just weird and I was fine and it didn’t really bother me now.  Then I googled and I experience all the things of someone that’s been sexually abused.  I’m promiscuous, have a hard time saying no, confusion around my sexual identity, disassociation during sex etc... When I was 10-12 and my brother was 12-14 we would do sexual things.  That entire part of my child and honestly my entire childhood prior to 13 is a blur.  I have shit memory now but I think I can’t remember much of it because of the hardships like the abuse and troubles at home.  But back to the point I don’t recall my brother ever forcing me to do anything but again I literally can’t remember a full timeline of anytime the sexual things happened it’s truly a blur.   I know they happened but to paint a picture of how it started what happened during and after I really couldn’t.  It’s just like random still shots of what happened without dialogue or motion.  I’m not sure who initiated it all to begin with.  Me and my brother come from a really big family and we were the closest in age and we were the closest.   He was a really troubled kid tho and I was always a goody too shoes and I got in trouble a lot because of him.   I would lie for him.  I’d do things I knew were wrong but he’d convince me.  One time he burned me with boiling water just because and I never said anything because I didn’t want him to get in trouble.  I’m not sure what my question is.  Is that abuse?  Is that affecting my sexual relationships now or have I just not found the right person?  Has someone experienced something similar?"
Can’t take it anymore!! Is it just me or has everyone been fighting w their significant other lately? Idk if it’s the stress of everything going on in the world? But I’ve been arguing over nothing w my boyfriend and I’ve been feeling like absolute shit about myself
"I broke a girls trust and I dont know how to make things right again So I’ve started dating this girl about 2 months ago and we really got along, when we started dating she told me she doesn’t hang with people that use drugs beacuse she has bad experiences from the past about it, i never really had problems with drugs i smoked a joint now and then but I was willing to let it go for her since it wasn’t important to me anyways so i told her im not smoking again. About a week ago my dumbass decided to smoke with a couple of friends it was really random and i just kinda went with it...I told her and she told me i broke her trust and dont know if she can continue this..i understand her thats why it scares me most...I really dont want to lose her beacuse of a fucking joint (sorry for the language ). She told me we can meet next week and clear things out...what can i do to make it right? She is my first with wich i really want to be and dont want to fuck it up...I appreciate any advices. Thank you."
"My parents make me anxious and contemplete my life. Hi, so i (18M) don't really know where to start, my stepmom is overall just horrible to me and always manages to manipulate me by making me feel bad and guilty in everything i do. And then there's my father, who basicly just lets this happen and doesn't really do anything about it while my relationship with my dad has always been good.

I have always already had some emotional baggage i guess? With a psychotic, bipolar mother that has been away for most of my childhood and has (so far) been 4 times forcibly admitted to mental health centers.

Now maybe a couple months ago, i said fuck it. Packed some clothes and moved in with my Sister and her Boyfriend. I have pretty much always had a good relationship with them but they fight alot. And today i woke up early but decided to stay in bed and heard them yelling at each other for the so manieth time. Overheard my sister boyfriend shouting thats he wants us both gone, again for the so manieth time.

Now obviously this has happened before so i know this will probably go over, but just the thought of having to go back to my stepmom and father makes me so anxious and honestly makes me have suicidal thoughts sometimes.
I have managed to live with them for a couple years just ignoring the bullshit but my stepmom couldn't handle all that and would do very childish things like throwing my worn dirty clothes under my bed refusing to wash them (we have a laundry bin, everyone throws theire worn clothes in after things like a shower), or have her trying to confront me about some total nonsense and when i go in for the discussion she will cry, play victim and go up stairs to her room while stomping her feet on the stairs like a child, it basicly just feels like emotional abuse being in that house.

I have managed for a couple years but i feel like i dont really know how to manage anymore

It just feels like life is so unfair and the whole situation just makes me feel hurt, and i am honestly having a really hard time focusing on something else or have to have/find something that brings joy to me.

Any advice on what i could do maybe?

And sorry for the grammar, i am not a native speaker."
"Groomed by a teacher  

A long time ago I think j was a 12-13ish boy. I was groomed by my Female teacher, through... a lot of incidents. She was very fond of me. She did things no teacher should say or do to their students. I have shared this story before, but never to a real person who knows me... like I've always kept it locked away, nothing ever happened but it was a little uncomfortable but... a part of me really liked it ... like to the point where I wished something had happened... and I do feel a little ashamed about that but I dont even know if it's normal or not.

I told this to someone really close to me, but i didnt tell them that i wished something had happened because it felt wrong...

They did find out because they found a post where I talked about wishing something had happened and they were really upset with me and I dont know what to do...

I actually also wonder if its normal to feel the way I felt... idk..."
"Boyfriend(28m)’s stepsister(33f) sends “attractive” selfies to him Like, kind of a lot of them. Typically with duck lips, heavily filtered, there was one with her tongue out... with language and emojis that seem almost flirty, like “💘”

I grew up with brothers, and I personally would not feel comfortable doing this. Interestingly, this person was not all that close to him growing up, and apparently doesn’t do this with her sisters...

I’ve already expressed that I find it inappropriate, with mixed responses from him. It’s clear he’s not going to stop her, and the pictures are maybe getting more explicit? What started out as the occasional smiling pic has lately been like once a week kissy face selfie, most recently it was 2 pics back-to-back, like wtf. I genuinely wonder if she has some twisted interest in him. How do I deal with this?"
"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (19M) of 6 months have had a rough patch lately, I read his messages and he’s been flirty with another girl. We met over PlayStation (I know) and we're in a long distance relationship. We were drifting apart recently, but things have been better the past few days. When we met I was obese. Although I’ve been losing weight, it’s a slow process. I’m losing weight of my own volition to make myself healthier &amp; he isn’t forcing me, but I know my excess weight makes him feel uncomfortable.



We had a series of arguments over the past month that culminated in us talking about this on the 7th May. He mentioned that he felt like this was a relationship he saw himself in forever, and he was worried about spending it with someone he wasn’t fully attracted to. He said he doesn’t want perfection, he just feels uncomfortable with me still being overweight, which I totally understand. We videocalled, and he felt relieved that I was looking better. Since Thursday 8th, he’s been super affectionate and we’ve both felt like the issue was resolved &amp; we’re back on track.



He’s recently started playing with a new group of people, including one girl. He started talking about her a lot &amp; spending time with her. He told me when he was going to hang out with her (not that I expect him to) and it was all cool. It’s worth mentioning that I actually really like this girl.



However, something about the timing of everything &amp; the fact he was hanging out with a new girl made my crazy jump out a bit, and I decided to read his messages on psn while he was sleeping. They started messaging on the 5th, then on the 6th he sent a photo of himself and she called him cute, said he should make an insta account and follow her. He NEVER sends people pictures. The messages at this time felt super flirty. They talked about another friend’s accent &amp; she asked “do you like Irish accents?” To which he replied “Irish is cute, but british is hotter” (her and I are both british). This sent a chill down my spine bc he mentioned that he thought her accent was really funny &amp; he liked it. On the 7th, he mentioned that they’d had a discussion about what they want from their futures, and he said it was pretty different, but the fact they’d had a conversation like that while knowing the messages they sent makes me feel sick. She sent a picture of herself yesterday and she’s so pretty. This was after our conversation together, and he told me she messaged him at the time bc we were in party together.



After we talked everything out on weds/thurs, he spent a lot of time with me. He’s been less flirty with her &amp; not made any more comments like that, but I’m worried that bc he was so affectionate yesterday that he feels guilty about messaging her like that. Is that crazy? I feel like I’m going insane, nothing like this has happened before.



My theory is that bc we were arguing &amp; he wasn’t bringing up his issues with my weight, he started to get close to this girl as a kind of escape. He mentioned that he felt trapped &amp; after losing weight himself, he didn’t want to be with someone overweight. I told him that it’s something I’m working on, and we kind of both broke down and told each other everything that’d been making us upset about our relationship. Perhaps he’s being super affectionate towards me because he feels guilty about messaging her? None of the messages were anything unforgivable, but it definitely seemed like he was exploring.




I feel sick about reading his messages because it goes against all my principles, and it’s a total invasion of privacy. However, my gut instinct was right. I felt like I trusted him and now I know I need to talk about this, but I don’t know if it’s worth bringing up with him, or whether I want to risk him knowing I read his messages. I’m trying to think of a way to ask him about this without him finding out, but that also feels shady. What should I do? Let it go, or bring it up?




P.S. I’d prefer you to be gentle about the weight situation; he isn’t happy with my weight and I’m not either, that’s why I’m making this change. He was also overweight when we met and he knows the mental toll it takes on a person."
"Quarantine hurts like hell I (22M) had a good relationship with (20F), we were basically in love and all. I really love the girl, making efforts in order to make it work. then the quarantine came, first month was cool, we were talking, sweet texts, facetime from time to time. things were interesting, spicy, cute and loving, it was good, kept me holding on in this quarantine. At the start of the second month, she became a bit distant, she wouldn't answer as quickly as before, and not in the same way. She wouldn't share things with me or compliment as she used to.. I confronted her about it, she tells me that she doesn't know how she feels, she has a strange feeling I do not know what that means. She does say that she loves me tho. Yesterday, she sent me a test, relationship test, our results were different, I told her that we still can understand each other, she told that maybe we don't anymore. That broke my heart. I do not know why she became so cold with me, for once I invested my emotions in a relationship.. I want her back, I want things to go back to the way they used to be. Please, help me. I already lost a lof of people that I love, and don't know how I would survive another loss."
How long did it take you to get over someone you felt you did wrong and they gave you the world? No need to be mean people Make mistakes. I recently got broken up with the love of my life for being a ass for self detrimental reasons. We dated for 4 and lived together for 2. Right now we haven’t talked in about 3 weeks since I want to respect her space. She said she wants to talk but once she isn’t angry anymore. So I’ve just been self improving and working out and trying to mentally get better. Problem is I love this girl so much. I know how can I when I’m the reason she left but sorry I’m human and fucked up. There isn’t a day or hour that goes by she doesn’t go through my mind and I relive what I could have done different but can’t and so many other things. Anyone one else experience similar things and if so how long until you got over it and did you get the girl back?
How long? I have been in a relationship for 2 years we’re both in our 20s. How long does it take to get over a breakup
"Love affair with the games consoles. So due to the lockdown my partner (26) has come to stay with me as a family member of his is high risk and he has to very occasionally work at the moment. He has also been asking me for a while to move in with me. 

It’s been challenging for me as it’s just me and my daughter usually. I’m used to doing the work that’s involved with looking after myself and one toddler that’s it. As a result of him being here I have loads of extra house work and he just doesn’t tidy up after himself most of the time. Typically if I don’t do it, then it doesn’t get done, and if I ask for help it’s usually a very delayed response also, usually because RuneScape is so important he can’t stop whats he’s doing for another 20 minutes. I’ve spoken with him about how it makes me feel. Honestly some little changes have happened but I’m still really bothered by the overall lack of change. 

This is where my main problem is though. 

Since he’s moved in, I said he could play on his PlayStation at mine as he kept begging me to. (He was trying to play call of duty while my young child was still awake so I’d always said no beforehand) This has resulted in spending less than 4 evenings with him in the past 4 weeks. 

He speaks to his friends all night, that’s cool it makes him happy, I just mind that I’m not getting a little more time with him in the evening when my little one is asleep so we can actually have us time. If he isn’t on the play station, then he has my tablet which he has essentially taken over with RuneScape. If it’s not the tablet then it’s runescape on the computer. I’m fed up of feeling like I’m trapped in my own home, with my partner, who would rather play games and chat to his friends nearly every night than have a little time with me when it’s just me not in mum mode.

He plays the PlayStation until 10/11/12 at night (until his mates all go offline) and then he will come over and ‘spend time with me’, all while sitting down on the tablet playing RuneScape. Being a mum, with health conditions that effect my energy levels and body in general, I don’t have a lot of time or energy to give after 9/10 as I’m knackered. Occasionally he might consider not playing if I suggest we might have some fun in the bedroom but that’s about it. I asked for a cuddle over two hours ago and he is still sat there bellowing to his friends down the microphone. While I don’t expect to spend every evening with him, I’m feeling really resentful that I’m trapped in my home with someone that just wants to play video games 24/7... I don’t even know what the point is to this. I just feel that whenever I speak to him about it what he says in response makes me feel like I’m too needy and I don’t know if I’m justified in my feelings or not. It’s making me question our future and I don’t know if he’s right when he’s saying I’m being overly silly or not"
"Should I confess to him again? Hi all,

Tl;dr: he liked me and chased me for a few months, I was unsure and careless, he stopped and said ""he doesn't feel the same way anymore"", and I realized my feelings for him, tried to save what we had, he rejected me. Now it's two months after, quarantine happened, and I still have feelings for him. We started talking again for a week now. Should I confess my feelings to him again?

My fears is that I'll come off as annoying, have no self-respect, and tone deaf if I confess to him again. We've talking in long paragraphs. This can't be just platonic? But I've been noticing he's been staying up late, and I feel like this means he must have a girl he's talking to into the night (this was what we used to do before)"
"I’ve found the love of my life, but she’s taken I need your help

tl;dr: I’ve love this girl more than anything ever, she knows that, and tells me how much she likes it, she says she’s had dreams of us kissing which she liked, and enjoys when I tell her about my dreams, but she has a toxic boyfriend 

—



So I (M17) know this girl (F16), we’ve been taking for over a year, and I love her more than anything. She has a boyfriend and they fight a lot but then he’ll show the littlest bit of affection and she’ll swoon for him. She knows I love her and I tell her everyday and she’s fine with it, she’s said she’s had dreams of us kissing and making out and when I say so have I, she says she loves them. I’ve tried for months to get her out do my head but to no avail, it won’t work, It needs to happen where we get together, I have limited time since we’re in different grades, preferably before summer. It can’t be actively trying to get them to break up, because that’s mean. And for reference the advice should be for when they’re strong and he shows tiny bits of affection. I don’t know what to do here I can’t live without her. Please help me."
"For those who got back with an ex, what was the in between time like? About 5 years ago, a questions like this was asked. I am curious to see what other stories people have about this. I want specifically hear stories about exes that moved on from another and then got back together in the future. Statistics show that most exes reconcile within 6-12 months after a really messy break up. What's the validity to this claim? Really, I just want to hear your story!"
"I feel like no one cares about me 
Hello, I’m 17 yo guy and I feel like no one cares about me besides my mom or close relatives and my best friend.


I started thinking about this when I got a sad time back in November and I started using drugs even at school.
It seemed like no one didnt care, I was literally popping pills in class, sipping stuff I shouldn’t and everyone that saw me was like: “wow cool”.


Are you kidding me? I dont find it cool and I believe that if I’ll ever see someone doing that I’d immediately try to help that person.


I believe that people that I consider friends are not real friends, maybe due me not going out that much, should I cut off my friendship with them?"
"Should I ask my female Chinese friend if she can set me up with any cute female friends of hers? Just wondering if asking about it is rude. I have a bit of a crush on her but unfortunately she already has a boyfriend. Might not be completely one sided though, considering she did apparently not want me to know she already had a boyfriend among other things. In any case I do quite like really petite Asian girls like her so maybe she could introduce me to a friend of hers? 

Or is it rude to ask that considering she might have a bit of a thing for me?"
"Girlfriend won't dump female friend who threatened her. I am 26, my girlfriend is 21. We call her J. I am from Europe, and she is an African who lives in Kenya. So it's a long distance relationship. Yesterday, she was hanging out with her female friend, Lydia. While doing so, she was carrying her phone while she went to the supermarket, and then it got lost. She doesn't have any money, so she couldn't buy her a new phone. I also didn't feel responsible to send her the money, because I think it was between her, and her friend. At first, I had a calm and sensible conversation over a phone call with Lydia, and we discussed the matter in a mature way. But then the call ended abruptly, followed by Lydia using my girlfriend's phone to threaten both me and my girlfriend over Skype. She used my girlfriend's phone to text me things like how she wanted to squeeze my girlfriend's neck, and how she was friends with a guy that was previously stalking her and bringing her in danger, that she wanted to call to come for her. I wrote to her, how paying for a new phone for her would bring me into economical issues, but she showed no mercy, and eventually, I had to end up sending the money to her for a new phone, before she would let my girlfriend leave her place. After sending the money, I got to talk to my girlfriend again over the phone, and she was clearly scared, and she almost couldn't talk. It brought both me and her into a lot of stress and concern.

Today, she is back home, and Lydia has travelled somewhere. The problem is, my girlfriend still has pictures and videos of her hanging out with Lydia on Instagram, facebook and tiktok. I have told her to delete the images, but she won't because she claims to have deserved it all, and it was her mistake etc. I just don't think her unintentional mistake excuses her friend to start threatening us and even worse, making my girlfriend scared of her life. It's like my girlfriend doesn't have enough self-respect to delete those pictures, and dump her friend. And it's bothering me a lot. I hate the face of that girl, especially because of how hurtful it was for me to hear my girlfriend scared over the phone. 

How do I convince my girlfriend to woman up, dump her friend Lydia, and delete all the pictures and videos she has of her on social media?"
"I texted an old crush. What should i do? I messaged my old crush with an empty new account and he was cool about the fact i had a crush on him we talked and i think the crush is back, talking to him felt good. But he wanted to see my picture and i told him I am shy and maybe i am afraid of him showing my pic to others. We didn't talk again (since 3 days ago) and i left his msg on seen what should i do? If his message me i will show him my pic, but he showed me a screenshit he texted his friend (who was my classmate to ask her about a girl named (my name) I think she insulted me to him cause he didnt message me again"
"I (21M) no longer feel satisfied or happy all the time with my relationship with my girlfriend (20F) but I don’t know what to say or do anymore. So my girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 3 years, and I’ve been super happy with her. I’ve struggled with symptoms of depression and anxiety and she really just made everything feel better.

Recently though I haven’t been as happy with our relationship. I’m a very social person, I love to go to parties and be around large groups of people. We’ve argued and had conversations about parties. My girlfriend is not at all as social as I am, and I have a larger friend group than she does. Even smaller gatherings (kickbacks, for example) started arguments.

Sometimes she tells me that she’s just jealous of how many friends I have and that’s why she gets so upset when I go out and she stays in, but it isn’t like I exclude her. I invite her to come with me to parties and smaller gatherings, but they aren’t really her thing. Other times when we argue she tells me how worried she gets, even though I always limit how much alcohol I have, and I always make sure I’m sober to drive or that I have a DD. I know how to take care of myself and keep myself safe.

The bottom line is that I really enjoy going to parties and being around my friends, and she always starts and argument about it. I feel like I’ve been pretty fair with her, I never have a problem with her going out to be with her friends, and we both trust each other fully. I’ve already talked to her about how I enjoy going to parties and I’ve cut back on it. I go to a party like once every 2 months if that. I don’t go out and party often at all, but I do drink and occasionally smoke when I’m with a small group of my close friends, but we don’t leave where we’re at and we just chill out for the night.

I also realize that drinking or using weed should ever be prioritized over my relationships, but I very much enjoy the social aspect of it with my friends. I limit how much I use alcohol or weed. I smoke MAYBE once a month, and as for drinking my girlfriend has expressed that she doesn’t have a problem with that since she enjoys to drink too.

I’m also dissatisfied with our intimacy, but I understand that everybody is different and she just doesn’t have that high of a sex drive. I would never cheat, and I never ever want to make her feel like she has to put out just to satisfy me, I want sex to be a special thing and I want her to enjoy it as much as I do. I always make sure I don’t come at her like I’m attacking her. I want us to be able to talk about our sex life and it feels like I can’t. 

Lastly, it’s been getting hard to express my feelings with her. It feels like every time I try to talk to her it results in an argument or her crying and I just end up feeling like an asshole. I’ve brought up wanting to be able to go out with my friends without her fighting with me about it. I feel very tied down. She gets jealous, upset, and freaks out a little bit when I even mention wanting to go to a party or a gathering. I can’t even talk about parties, different things to spice up our sex life, or even my feelings without feeling like I’m making everything about me. It’s like whenever I’m down and want to talk the subject changes or she also get sad like it’s some sort of competition and I end up having to comfort her. 

For example, recently I told her that this pandemic and quarantine is getting to me, and it’s been making me feel depressed and immediately she begins going on about how she doesn’t feel like she has any close friends, or how she never gets invited to anything (which might I add isn’t entirely true but I get where she’s coming from). Then after I comforted her I tried to bring up how I felt, and she just changed the subject to something else focusing on her.

The TL;DR is that I feel like a selfish asshole for wanting to go out and party, talking about our sex life, or trying to talk out my feelings. I feel like an asshole for wanting to be able to talk to a lot of people, male or female. It just feels like I’m stuck and I don’t know what to do and no matter what it is, I ALWAYS end up feeling like a selfish POS in the end.

I just need advice on what to do, I’ve tried talking/arguing it out and even though it feels like we make progress I always end up feeling dissatisfied and like I can’t have anything for myself."
"Convincing myself to move on - help! TL;DR Recent breakup, but I seem unable to convince myself it is the end and move on. Any advice on how to proceed, please?

Hi, everyone!

Just a bit of context: my partner (30M) and I (F27) have been together for over 5 years now. Beginning was great, lovey-dovey and all that crap for a couple of months. Then we went LDR for a while. That's when things started to go caput - lots of message discussions, jealousy and resentment on both sides.

We eventually got to living together, but things were already not the same. We decided to keep trying, however, and on and off things were fine, but not amazing. We had several fights in the mean time and promises that both sides would change and try harder, and I guess in some ways we have improved in the relationship dynamics. Saying that, there's still a lot of resentment in between, mainly on my side, which obviously does not work out well.

We are both very different people, and I innocently thought we could complement each other. I am an introvert, he is an extrovert. I love reading and studying, he loves PC gaming. I love baking, he loves his TV shows. I like some eventual romance, he is more the brute type. We are both extremely stubborn and not the best communicative people. 

Now, you see where I'm going with this. He earns less than me, which is not a problem by itself, but he does nothing to try and grow in life. He seems quite comfortable in having a mediocre job and settling there. My job involves lots of career progression, constant studying and dedication, so I am not happy that he cannot try any harder to grow in a career. I also resent the fact that he spends pretty much all of his free time playing and drinking, and doing nothing else with himself (he has all the free time in the world now with lockdown). Plus, I have to nag him all the time to do house chores - I do have an OCD issue - and he says I'm always annoying him about that. So these were some of the reasons of previous fights, promises he would improve and I would relax a bit regarding the house and his gaming. 

We got to a point where the anger was constant and I made the decision to end the relationship a few days ago. He accepted it well, has been on his game room the whole day and we have been sleeping in different bedrooms, until lockdown is over and he can move away. 

The problem is that I'm not dealing well with this all, I feel paralysed and crying around the corners, while he seems so fine playing. I know there's still love on both sides, and although consciously I know this is the end and that we have tried time and time again, deep inside I hope there's still a chance for us to be together and well. It itches me to go back and 'cancel' the whole breakup thing, keep trying to work on it.

Therefore (and I'm sorry for the huge post), how can I convince myself this is actually over and start to move on? Does anyone think this relationship can still be fixed? 

Thank you."
"I (19M) can’t bring myself to get close to anyone Context: 5 years ago my ex messed me up BAD. My head still hasn’t fully recovered from all the games she played with me.

Used to be a really scummy person and a bit of a player. Trying to leave that lifestyle behind though.
———————————————

Can’t believe I’m here, but why not. So about a week ago I went on this date with a girl I’ll call Sam (23F). So our date goes great, no pressure for anything or high expectations and she’s a really nice girl, but out of the blue she started talking bout this other dude (30ish... this isn’t important just not clear on rules) and she talked bout how she had a bunch of options and by the end of the night, we decided to just be friends after I convinced her to give the other dude a shot, although she was apprehensive at first. 

It’s a weird feeling really, cuz I regret being easy for a while because I was trying to discover myself, and because of that, I feel like I don’t deserve love/ marriage/ relationships in that regard etc etc etc. I don’t know if it’s because my ex’s influence and how toxic we both were still is floating around and I just need more time, or if I should, as my cousin said “Man the fuck up and stop being a pussy, always running from love.” I always tend to get lost in working out or songwriting to where I try to convince myself I don’t have time.


Advice? I’ll give all the info you want. I’m desperate."
"Am I overreacting or what? So before work I'll sometimes go to Starbucks and get an ice coffee. In the past month I've gone maybe 5 times, so almost once a week. Yesterday this girl that gave me my drink asked me if I usually get a frappuccino, so I told her yeah because I didn't know what to say for some reason. I don't know if she is someone I've seen before there because it's hard to tell because she has a mask on, because of the whole coronavirus stuff. 
       So today I went back and got another coffee and she asked what my name was and I told her mine and she went and got my drink and said ""See you next time *my name"". The reason I think she might like me is because I go there like once a week and the fact that she remembers me and asked for my name and stuff is interesting. I don't know if she's trying to be nice or is kinda giving me the sign. We couldn't talk much because the drive through is always busy, also she is pretty nice haha. 
     Also I know this sounds kinda dumb of a question, it's just weird that she remembers me specifically etc. I don't know if her asking for my name is a sign she is kind of into me or is just trying to be nice."
"I (22M) don't want to marry my girlfriend (21F) My girlfriend and I met around a year ago at work. We hit it off as close friends really early on, spending a lot of time together even off the clock. For several months, I told her I wouldn't want to date her (she made it very clear she was interested very early on) due to various reasons that I suppose I never really made clear to her. I didn't find her physically attractive and I don't want to spend my life with someone who can't take good care of herself (she's 5'4 and \~270lb). I didn't think we were particularly sexually compatible, and spending extended periods of time with her often wore me out early on.

 Eventually I decided I was being shallow and we started dating, which was fine for the first couple of months, but now we've moved out into our own apartment and I'm having some regrets. Before we moved out, she told me the only thing keeping her from having sex was her parents asleep in the next room, and assured me that as soon as we moved out she'd be all over me. As soon as we moved out, though, she completely changed her mind. I'm not sure exactly what prompted that, but now we've also got roommates and one of them has herpes (on her elbow) and my girlfriend has massive anxiety that she's going to catch (or spread, she thinks she has it even though she's been tested negative numerous times) herpes. She says now during the quarantine is too much stress for her and she doesn't want to throw the stress of sex on top of that, but to me not having sex is stressing *me* out. She had me convinced that we weren't as sexually incompatible as I thought, but I'm completely doubting that. She also told me she was losing weight, but she seems to have completely given up on that as well. It's really not about her appearance so much as her lack of self control- I'll just randomly catch her eating total garbage and she never has an excuse for it (not even ""i'm hungry"") and I don't want to  be a dick by calling her out for it. She has temper issues, she lies to people (including me), she has no apparent creativity or interest in thinking deeply about anything, she doesn't like to learn new things, she's lazy, and she still keeps bringing up ""why haven't you proposed"" and similar questions, even though she's basically said she wants to put progressing our relationship on hold due to the COVID19 situation.

I have 7 more months on the lease and no spare bedroom here or anything. I don't want to marry her. I couldn't imagine doing that right now- she has so much that she would need to change before I could even think of having her raise any future children, like so much that I honestly feel I'd be better off finding a new person. Because of the whole corona/living together situation I feel completely trapped. We share a bed, but that's about it. She still loves me and I still care for her and don't want to hurt her, but how am I supposed to even explain how I'm feeling without destroying her? What am I supposed to do about the next several months of rent if we break up and one of us has to move out?

I'm completely lost here, I really hoped this one would be the one and I don't know what to do now that I feel like she isn't."
"How to break up with someone you love? Long story short, i have to break up with my current girlfriend we have 8 month long- distance relationship. But i love her and get used to be with her. I think i am addicted. I have heavy depression and sometimes can’t deal with considering she is not with me. How can i end this? How can i get rid of this bad, weak feeling? Some people just move on their lifes or make new hobbies but i don’t want to do anything."
"Should I ask to dtr even though I’m leaving the country? Kind of long, so bare with me! 

This guy (24m) and I (23f) have been hanging out for a month now. And not just hanging out once a week, like hanging out every night for a month. The first night we just talked for hours and then had sex and it was a couple days where we were having a looot of amazing sex. Then all of sudden he stopped wanting sex, but would still ask me to come over. I tried not to push it because he said he needed a break from sex. Thenn it had become a week of no sex, but still sleeping in the same bed every night and even started a Netflix show we watched together and finished. Like went over to his place to watch it and get high. I should note, even though we weren’t having sex he would still flirt with me, grab my ass, fill me up and cuddle me while we hung out or when we’re in bed. It started to become confusing af because I just wanted sex and it seemed like that’s what he wanted too, because he had just gotten out of a 2 year relationship! That he also mentions and talks to me about CONSTANTLY. It’s honestly been really getting to me. That’s when I kind of was like I need to start prying a little and ask what’s going on. Apparently he had been with some other girl and thought he had chlamydia (he did) and didn’t want to give it to me if I didn’t already have it from the unprotected sex we had already (hard eye roll). Thankfully, I was negative and got medicated. But then it made me really think, “wtf are we?”. Like if I did have something, it would’ve been for what? Some guy who just wanted a rebound fuck??  I also around this time started noticing he was snap chatting  a lot with the same/ different girls a lot even while we were hanging out and he had asked me to come over. It started making me feel weird and kind of had been ruining the mood when I was over there. Especially because one of the girls he’s been talking to gave him chlamydia!! Like why are you still talking to her?! Especially after trying to convince me he was over her and was taking a break from hooking up, but still wanted to kick it with me because he likes my company and we get along really well. He’ll even say little things like how he loves having sex with me and it’s the best he’s had. But that he also likes just being with me without the sex and so have I. It just hella seems like we are headed that way with out any boundaries and it’s bugging me. 

But the gag isss, I have no place to stand because I’m moving out of the country in like 3 months. so why ask to dtr, if it could only be for the summer. I’m starting to realize I really like him and wouldn’t mind seeing where things go. But he’s fresh out of a relationship, trying to find validation through hook-ups so he just wants to talk to mad girls Because it feels good after a break-up and I don’t want to keep him from doing his thing because I want it. I completely understand that he might not be ready for a relationship, but I don’t know why he acts like we are. I’ve done the hooking up and it’s just not my thing anymore. But I don’t want to keep him from having fun because I catch feelings for boys who are nice to me! 

Also we have never kissed in the month we’ve been together, even during sex. (I love kissing, so this has been a big intimacy problem for me. I’m just honestly really confused about what we are and what he wants from me. I want to have fun, but I don’t want to be hurt. Especially now that I’m catching feels. When should I dtr or should even say anything because I’m moving??"
"Husband (33) crossed boundary. Why is he reacting like I'm (29F) the bad guy? Long story short. Husband got a happy ending massage. He had done it in the past and I told him he should talk to me about it if he felt like he needed to do that. He did not talk to me this time just came home and confessed when he had been gone much longer than a normal grocery trip should take. I told him that he knows I told him to talk to me before hand and suddenly it turned into ""you don't give me intimacy"" ""what's the difference if I ask before"" ""I shouldn't need permission"" ""its your fault"" ""if your ex and me both cheated on you then you are the problem"" ""you make having sex not fun because you say it hurts"" (he lasts a long time due to what I think is deathgrip and I start to get dry after a period of time)

For the record we do have sex fairly regularly, we literally had sex the day before he did this. What kind of crazy mind games is he playing by saying I made him cheat? Is that ever possible?"
"My mom (56F) and sister's (23F) behavior has significantly worsened my (19M) mental health during quarantine and I don't know what to do. I (19M) am a 2nd year (almost 3rd year) college student living at home with my mom (56F), dad (57M) and sister (23F) because of the quarantine forcing my peers and I off campus.  To say that being in quarantine has generated family drama would certainly be an understatement.  Before I get into recent specifics, I think it would be best to give some context to the family drama.

First off, my sister is Bisexual, and when she came out with a girlfriend to my mother, her reaction was certainly not the most supportive.  My mom is generally socially liberal, but having her daughter come out surprised her in the worst way possible.  She cried, and my sister has never forgotten or forgiven my mother for her lack of initial support (my mom doesn't care anymore, it was mostly a shock reaction I guess).

My sister and I were relatively close growing up, but as we got older, my sister became a lot less dependable and a lot ruder.  When she was with her first girlfriend, she hardly ever came home, staying at her house basically every night in protest of what she saw was a lack of support from my mother.  Because of this, most of the frustrations in the house were placed on me from both my parents.  Whenever my sister would do or say something that they didn't like, it was always a ""I can't believe how disrespectful both my children are to me"" even if I wasn't involved.  Because of this, I have dealt with severe anxiety and am constantly apologizing (my friends are trying to help me get out of this unhealthy loop).

On New Years, my sister backed her car into my car and caused almost 1000 dollars worth of damage, and instead of owning up to it, drove off and refused to pay me, citing that I was family and how could I, her brother, make her pay.  She avoids me, and refuses to talk to me.  However, my mother and father have enabled her by not forcing her to pay me until she has the money (which she already has but refuses to give in spite).  My mom is constantly telling me to bury the hatchet and talk to my sister, which is something I have no interest in doing.  Her reaction to the whole situation is something that is going to take a long time, and effort on her part to get forgiveness for.

A couple of weeks ago, my sister came home and begged my parents to allow her to adopt a cat that she found with her friends at a local Chipotle parking lot, and despite me and my Dad's clear desire to not adopt another cat into our house especially in lieu of my sister's immaturity and disrespect, my opinion is overshadowed as my mom is always telling me that I don't own the house.  However, my dad caved in to my mom because they feel for some reason that they need to appease her so she can like them again.  This was all at the beginning of quarantine.  My sister also plans to move out soon, so the cat would not be staying the house, so as long as it didn't affect me or go near my belongings, I was annoyed because of my sister's involvement, but generally fine.

However, my sister simply does not take care of the kitten.  It is only 5 weeks old and my parents enable her by doing the work for her despite constantly scolding her over text and by phone.  My mom consistently asked me to see the cat (which I didn't want to do because I don't want to form an attachment and what it represents to me in terms of my sister).  After saying no, and arguing about it constantly, I finally caved in and visited the cat once.  That was it.

Today, my mom asked me whether or not the cat could go into my TV room in order to ""explore the house"" (even though he won't even live here for long).  I said no because that room contains exclusively stuff that I have bought including my own TV, couch, PlayStation, Fire TV, Posters and chairs.  I have spent hundreds of dollars of hard earned money on this room  This is my one haven in the house to escape from the constant tension revolving my sister and my mom.  When I said no, my mom kept asking why to which I explained that I don't want it near my stuff and that they promised that its existence in the house would not affect me at all.  She kept asking and asking and I snapped as a normal human would do when being constantly asked why, why why.  I hate to say this, but dealing with my mom sometimes feels like I am dealing with a little kid who won't stop until they get their way.  By saying no and holding my ground however, I am an ungrateful little shit and have brought nothing but pain to my parents lives.  Somehow, I am disrespectful for valuing my belongings and for wanting my mother to honor her promise regarding the cat.  She always plays the victim with everything and again, groups me together with my sister for being such ""assholes.""   

I have been dealing with my mother my whole life, and she has never apologized for anything, and my dad is such a pushover that he just nods his head and lets my mom get away with everything.  During the arguments during quarantine she has made numerous deeply hurtful comments regarding my relationship that recently ended before quarantine, blaming me for it.  Being at home has made me miserable, and has contributed to a depression that I have held to myself for at least 2 years (the beginning of college really was the beginning of the peak of my mental health issues).  Despite working a stressful essential job as a pizza delivery driver during this pandemic (partly to get out of the house), I feel no relief when I get home.  I feel so lost and I don't know who to turn to or get help from, especially during this unique situation we are in globally.  I have never felt so hopeless or lost before in my life, so please help me Reddit.  What should my next steps be?"
"I (26M) have a depressed partner (27M) who has depression and I can’t cope anymore. Hello everyone,

I am hoping to get some insight and advice from anyone here on what I need to do.

To give you some background, my partner has been suffering clinical depression for quite a few years and generally has small period of highs and lows but over the last 12 months have been very trying for him, myself and our relationship.

My partner is originally from overseas and was originally in my country to study but due to issues, he has had to suspend his studies which in turn means he has stopped working and now we in a difficult process of him trying to get permanent residency.

Over the last 12 months, due to him not working, not studying and plus going through the massive hurdles of trying to get him permanent residency, he has consistently been saying that he is worthless, a burden to others and feels helpless. He has mentioned suicide a few times and how he doesn’t want to live anymore and believes he’s a burden. It’s been a constant theme and it’s been making me feel incredibly anxious, nervous and I feel that I’m spiralling into a case of depression myself and I feel like I need to end the relationship otherwise I feel like I am going to end up unwell myself.

I have tried really hard to be the best, supportive partner I can be by checking in on him often, asking him questions and ringing. It makes it difficult at the moment due to Coronavirus because of restrictions, I am not able to leave where I am to physically go and see him.

My biggest concern is that if I was to end the relationship to not only to make myself focus on my mental health, is that he may cause potential harm to himself and if something was to happen, I know it would make me feel too guilty.

Is it morally wrong to leave someone who is suffering from a mental illness to save your own mental health? If I was to end the relationship and cease communication, should I feel guilty if something does happen? I’m stuck and I’m unsure of what to do."
"Forever alone belief system I (28F) used to play when I was a kid that I wouldn't get married. I was always a single mom during playtime and if I got married I would always, by the end of the pretend, get divorced. My parents have been married for over 30 years, ups and downs like everyone else, but sure they are a couple to follow the example. 

In my adult life, I have had more than 4 serious boyfriends and even one girlfriend, been on the edge of marriage two times, lived with 2 boyfriends and I feel like I'll be alone for the long run. Sometimes I want to get married, I dream about having a life long partner, but always at the end, this belief that I will be alone is stronger than anything else.

I have no idea where this comes from because I've felt it since I was little and had no understanding of the real thing. Digging deeper today, I have many rational ideas about marriage and how it could or couldn't work, but can't seem to shake off the belief that has been in place for so long.

Is there a psychological explanation for this? Can I overcome it? Do I surrender to it?"
"How should I (21F) ask my SO (32M) to be more ‘intimate’ with me via online? Hi!

Not a throwaway account; I’m still new-ish to Reddit and thought it was cool to add ‘throwaway’ in my username then I saw the rules about such accounts and died in the inside as I realized it’s stuck as my username forever—

But that’s not the point, I’m here to ask how to talk to my SO about being *sexually* intimate with me online. 

We don’t live together and our sex life was hip and cool until Covid-19 decided to drop a fresh one. The closest we’ve ever had any spice going on is me sending non-Christian photos of myself. That’s literally it.

I’m really not sure how to bring up to him the idea of ‘camgirl sessions’ (me fuckin around on FaceTime) as he’s not a fan of video calling. Neither of us are also experienced in phone sex.

If you have any sexy ideas, please feel free to tell me! I really appreciate this and I hope you’re having a sexy time wherever you are!

Edit: Cashing in on that update, we talked and now we’re fresh and cool again! Still, feel free to comment any ideas : )"
"My boyfriend makes me feel bad about denying him and having constructive criticism for our relationship My boyfriend has always been great, for the most part. However, I’ve had a few problems.
Every time I’ve decided to come out and tell him what’s troubling me in our relationship because I realize that communication is key, he makes me feel so guilty for thinking the way I do until the conversation ends with me apologizing many times for believing what I did. It sounds bad when I word it that way, but it really isn’t. He just calls himself a horrible boyfriend, insists that he loves me in every way and that I should never doubt that, and punishes himself for making me think somewhat negatively. I always feel really bad, so I take back everything I said afterwards. Whenever I deny him anything - sexual things, mostly -, he sulks and tries to guilt trip me until I eventually give in. I know he’s doing it somewhat jokingly, because he whines and says ‘you don’t love meeee’. I’m not typically a spineless pushover, but I end up doing whatever he wants in order to make him happy, though I struggle sometimes because I get satisfied in different ways than he does. He always has sex on his mind or whatever, but I’m the type of person who is content with hugs and a nice conversation. He struggles to make a conversation with me that isn’t just flirting. I know we aren’t totally compatible, in our sex drives, love languages, sense of humor, moral beliefs, etc, but I do love him and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts or advice."
"I told a girl I liked her, she didn’t like me but now she does. I don’t like her anymore. TLDR: I liked a girl, she had a bf we stop talking, they break up a year later, I tell her I liked her, she flirts with me, she likes other boy, she confesses to boy but gets rejected, she likes me now, I don’t like her. I don’t want to be someone’s last option.

Important stuff- I’m asexual homo-romantic, she’s bisexual 
Extra stuff- she always pretends she’s smarter than she is and undermines my opinions and views on stuff because “I’m an art student.”
More extra stuff- she knows I’m asexual but she doesn’t believe me because “I’m too young to know”. 

I have been friends with this girl for years now and she has always been flirty with me so I developed feelings for her. I felt like I could never tell her about it because she had a boyfriend and we stopped talking because of him. 

A year later she breaks up with him and I tell her I stopped talking to her because of her boyfriend and that I had feelings for her. We started talking again and went to a Christmas party together where we apparently “kissed” (I don’t remember). She starts holding my head and cuddling with my and it weirded me out because we have only been talking once a week for 2 weeks, we went as close as we used to be. I then saw on her Snapchat she was doing the same things to other girls from a mutual friend, this made me quite upset but I kept it to myself. 

Once college stared again we saw each other more but then she tells me about this guy in her class who she has a huge crush on, all she spoke about was him for weeks and I say she should tell him how she feels, don’t get me wrong l still liked her but it felt like she didn’t like me so I had to let her be happy with him instead so I let her go, I had to be a supportive friend (that was what I was thinking anyway). 

Weeks go bye and I haven’t heard anything from her (I was also dealing with a lot of depression at the time and had to leave college because of it). I decided to visit her in case her phone broke or something, there was nothing wrong with her phone she just didn’t want to text me back. She then hints that she wants a Valentine’s Day present and we watch some tv, she starts cuddling me and holding my hand again and I just let it happen (I was very uncomfortable, I froze like a statue). 

I decided to buy a good buy Valentine’s Day president (I know it was a bad idea) I got her flowers and said “I know you like someone else and I hope you 2 end up together goodbye”. After that things felt like they were back to normal like how things used to be until mid March, I saw on her story that the guy she liked didn’t liked her back, she wanted me to come over to cheat her up but it was 1am and I wasn’t allowed. 

She stopped talking to me for awhile then the big bad virus happened, she again refused to respond to my messages so I gave up trying to talk to her. 

This week I got a text from her say to return her cloths I borrowed from the Christmas party, I agreed and I gave it back (I was wearing my mask and cloves don’t worry... she wasn’t but I brought extra for her). We decided to go for a walk together to catch up. She try’s to hold my had and Instinctively say no (because of the social distancing stuff), I then come out with my true feelings, I told her to stop send me mixed messages and if she likes me tell me and if to it’s ok tell me. She then ignores me and changes the subject, I get pissed, I pretend a phone call and go home. 

No YouTube Redditor people read this on there channel please, she watched those videos."
"Is it inappropriate to pursue younger men? I (27F) teach courses at a rec centre close to a college campus. All throughout my classes I act as professional as possible, because I love what I do. One of my students (20M) grew on me, and at the end of the course I realized I was very attracted to him, and not just for his looks, but I managed to maintain my professional composure until the course was over. 

Just as the campus was beginning to shut down for quarantine, I gave all of my students options to submit remaining assignments through email, or to drop by during any of my last shifts before the rec centre closed for quarantine, if they were comfortable with it, to do so in person. All of my students chose to email assignments except him, and I was freaking out wondering if he would make a move, or if maybe I should make a move, or if I was reading too much into the situation. Certainly a young jock-type guy like him wouldn't be interested in average-weird-girl like me, right? It is difficult to convince myself we had a connection when I consider myself out of his league.

I decide to play it by ear, and we make small talk about classes (I started college last year, but at a smaller college in the city) I can tell he is visibly nervous while I am filling out some forms for him, which I find very enduring, and he was not generally this way during classes either. I ultimately decide I don't want to chance ruining our professional relationship unless he explicitly wanted to at this point, and I don't ask him out.

I understand I am intimidating, because I have been told by partners my age before, but I try to keep my work demeanor friendly in hopes that I invite questions about the topic I teach. I would say I am bad at flirting too, which is why I generally do end up making the first move by being direct and suggesting a date. While I feel like there was a sort of chemistry between us, albeit an awkward-because-I-have-to-be-professional one, I am still mulling the pros and cons of asking him out in my head, and the biggest of the cons being the age difference.

I found out he plays in a band, and I am considering going to one of his shows once this quarantine business is lifted, so I can play it like I am just there for the music if the situation goes sour, but I am still concerned about coming off as creepy or cougarish if I show up there. It has got to be my biggest worry as I approach my 30's. 

Do any older women who have or have had relationships with younger guys have any advice on dispelling sleezy cougar stereotypes and pursuing younger men? Do I just have to accept and embrace it? And younger men, how open are you to the possiblity of being with older women? What can I do to not come off as a grandma (or mother or aunt)?

TL;DR Attracted to an awkward but handsome man 7 years my junior, who was once my student, and too nervous to go to his band's show to possibly ask him out."
"Is it ok for me to be bothered by my girlfriend seeing other guys dicks? I've been told it isn't a big deal and I'm overreacting, and maybe my reaction is due to how I've been raised but, it makes me extremely uncomfortable whenever say, her and a friend go on a sight like omegle and see a bunch of incels jerkin. Is that ok or am I just being stupid?"
"Am I being a controlling girlfriend? Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any advice :) 

Backstory: my partner (24M - let’s call him H) has a history of issues with drug and alcohol use. I (23F) rarely drink - I’ve always been pretty hesitant with alcohol because of my family’s history of addiction. We’ve been together about 9 months, and he let me know early on (before we were officially together) about his past experiences with addiction. He’s always been really clear that it’s a part of himself he doesn’t like and has done major work on himself to get him where he is now, including going to addiction counselling. Because of his honesty with himself and his strong desire to continue to improve, I felt comfortable to be in a relationship with him (I never thought I would consider a relationship where there are addiction issues involved, again, because of my family history). In the early part of our relationship, before I fully understood the seriousness of his substance use issues, I would occasionally go out to party with him but after seeing him get unbelievably wasted every time and then hating himself the next day, I started feeling uncomfortable. I wasn’t sure how best to help him, and I always found myself questioning what role I should play in this. I ended up deciding that I was never going to tell him not to go out, not to drink, etc, but would try to encourage other activities first, and if we were in situations where alcohol was involved, to try to keep water coming his way, getting him to dance etc instead of hanging out at the bar. I would also encourage counselling and let him know I’m an open ear. His addiction issues were nothing we ever discussed in the context in our relationship, I just tried to be nonjudgmental as he slowly opened up to me about his past. This pattern continued until about a month ago, when he went out partying one night without me. At the time, we were temporarily living together and he told me he wouldn’t be out too late. Basically, he called me once early on in the night to just check in, and then around 1-2 am I called him. He was super wasted and I could barely understand what he was saying, and he wouldn’t reply to any of my questions about when he’d be home. I tried to text him to see if I could get clearer answers, but not answer. I fell asleep and woke up to him stumbling into bed around 6 am. 
I was feeling upset at him the next day and when he woke up he was just laughing about being out all night. This was the first time I ever felt genuinely upset about how his substance use affected our relationship. I felt so conflicted about his behaviour - in past relationships I had never had an issue with that sort of partying on occasion, because none of my ex’s had a problematic relationship with alcohol. This was different, because I knew he was not only hurting me but mostly himself. We ended up having a major discussion about it and I ended up telling him that I’m trying my best to support and encourage him but in the end, I can’t tolerate binge drinking and him completely disappearing for a night. He apologized and said that he agrees I shouldn’t be treated that way and he would work on being better.

Current question/issue:
So yesterday he’s working, we’re not in contact much during the day but he lets me know that he’ll be home around 7.  Around 6:30 he lets me know that he’s going to have dinner with his coworker (35ishM) and he’ll be home a bit later. No issue, but I ask if he’s going to be home late. Three hours later, he lets me know he won’t be back until early tomorrow. I’m confused so I call him and he picks up super drunk. His coworker is joking around pretending to be H, and when I finally get to speak to H I can hear his coworker yelling at him to ‘just hang up’.  Im upset with H and I ask we he couldn’t have replied to me earlier. He responded with ‘live your own life’. Somehow I eventually get back on the call with his coworker and he tells me H has had too much to drink and he’s gonna put him to bed. I’ve been concerned about this coworker for a while now (another story), and since him and H are good friends, I ask him if he knows about H’s history with alcohol, hoping that if he did, he wouldn’t be encouraging H to drink as he has been. He doesn’t answer the question, instead tells me about how hard and how well they work together and that it’s not his fault if H comes home drunk, which I agree with. He then starts telling me I should come over for dinner tomorrow night so I can see that he’s actually a good guy (we’ve never met), and that he has a wife and children and that he provides for them very well financially. I start to say that I don’t think making money for your family necessarily makes you a good person, and before I could tell him I was not trying to attack him personally, he yells at me saying that ‘if you think I’m such a terrible person you should call someone else’ and then hung up. Admittedly I probably WAS throwing a bit of a personal attack in there...
I call my partner a little later in the evening, hoping he’s sobered up and can talk to me properly.  No answer. Today, no contact from him all day. Later in the evening he says we need to talk and comes over. He asks me to recap what happened last night (blackout). I tell him I’m upset because we had a serious conversation about this before and he said situations like this wouldn’t happen again. He defends himself saying that I shouldn’t be creating rules for him and that it’s his own choice to make. He also defends what his coworker was saying, saying that I was ‘threatening his ability as a man’. He says I’m controlling and we break up. So I need some unbiased perspective - am I in fact being controlling? I’m having a hard time finding the line between being controlling and setting standards/boundaries for myself."
"How do I approach asking my sister to move back out? My (30F) sister (29F) has been staying with us (boyfriend, 31) since lockdown began. She only lives half an hour away but would have been on her own the whole time so we invited her to stay with us, naively thinking it would be a couple of weeks. It’s been 8 weeks now and we have had our ups and downs, like everyone has I’m sure. Sis and I have been keeping ourselves sane with regular exercise (we have weights and stuff) and healthy living, apart from weekends where we have pizza and wine (crazy crazy times). We also get on really well with our neighbours and have been having social distancing drinks with them. I feel like my sister has really got used to the new routine and lifestyle and fear that she is in no danger of moving out any time soon and bf and I really miss having the place to ourselves (2 bed flat with garden in London, not massive but not pokey). We haven’t asked for any money or anything as she’s still paying for her own place and she’s hard-up for cash like we all are. I can’t see the current climate changing drastically any time soon so she will have no concrete reason to move back home - how am I going to approach asking her to move out? Or should I just suck it up and let her stay?"
"How to cope with being a former abuser? A few years ago I was informed that I had sexually abused someone in high school (2012). This made me so physically upset that I botched my apology, and this caused a lot of problems. I have done a lot of work to understand proper apologies, to redeliver it as best I could manage, and to understand where I've come from and how I could have acted so callously. I think I've made a lot of progress except for one thing:


I cannot forgive myself, and knowing that I abused somebody at all makes me want to die. 


I was told that we could heal and become friends, but I can't look at her without feeling guilty and self-hatred. She was very close friends with my now fiance, who knows everything. She was abandoned by most of her friends, including the girl I abused, for staying with me knowing what I had done and how poorly my apology had gone. 

I just feel so much guilt. My fiance says she doesn't blame me, and she doesn't see me as that person, she knows I wouldn't treat her that way. It's wonderful to know that I can still love and be loved, but I feel like such a shitty person so often. 

Advice request: how to move on from being an abuser that fractioned my fiance's friend group? (Besides not existing anymore)

Edit: the validity of the abuse is not the concern."
"My GF(F21) seems upset about me(M24) making a Grindr Throwaway account lol

Recent quarantine got me and my gf pretty bored. So we did what any rational couple would do, become sugar babies.

We started with some dating sites for sugar babies and sugar daddies and of course, she started getting attention and money just for texting and sending pics of her(no nudes). At this point of course with me being a guy I have made nothing. So I hear from a friend of mine that he has gotten quite a few sugar daddies on Grindr and of course I decided to try my chances at it.

So I get on Grindr and start chatting and trying to find my sugar daddy and tell my gf about it and my friend's success stories. She seemed pretty upset and just went straight to bed and hung up on me saying she wasn't upset when I asked but just saying she was tired.

Did I do something wrong? I don't really think I'm in the wrong here for doing the same thing she has been doing but on a different app."
"He won't understand Ah shit here we go again into another fight, he again saying the same shit as always. He again blaming me on god-knows how many shit there is in our relationship"
"My girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) have been together for 5 years and have still not had sex, but our physical intimacy is decreasing. I love my girlfriend a lot and I know that she loves me. We've been together since our freshman year of high school and are going pretty strong through college. She makes me happy and I feel that I make her happy too. We spend as much time together as we can and often talk on the phone and text when we're apart. We're both young, fit, and decently attractive people (her more than I but I don't think I'm ugly).

Our love is mostly emotional love for one another, rather than more physically sexual love. While we haven't had sex, we can still be physically intimate and sexually satisfy one another in other ways. When our relationship first started we often engaged with one another when we could and we're active in that regard. She has not wanted to have sex yet because she's not ready. Her mother had her at a young age and she not only doesn't want to end up like her but she also wants to have a chance at living life before having the responsibility of raising a child. She has tried birth control but she doesn't like the way that it makes her feel and she doesn't seem to want to try using condoms either. I completely respect and support her reasoning and I would never try to argue with her on that. I love my girlfriend and I would never pressure her into doing something that she was uncomfortable with or does not want to do. While I would like the experience of having sex I respect her decision and will continue to stand by her.

My issue began around the end of the third year of our relationship as she became less and less physically intimate with me. We didn't argue any more than we used to (which wasn't too much anyway, just small arguments here and there) and we didn't have any sort of family crisis or tragedies happen. It seemed that most of my sexual advances were just beginning to be rejected as she was not in the mood. At first this was fine as I understand that our sex drives are different but it seemed to get worse over time. Every advance I made was rejected and the rejections began to hurt more and more over time as I felt ""too ugly"" or ""too horny."" I began to look at my sexual urges as a more primitive feeling that needed to be controlled as I started to feel like a creep that only wanted one thing. 

With time my libido decreased and I no longer crave the physical intimacy that I once did. Sometimes when it does spark up I'll occasionally remember the feelings of rejection that I would get and my sexual urges will pass. On college breaks (and now due to quarantine) we stay at her mother's house and sleep in the same bed. When her mom is away my girlfriend will often sleep almost naked and will walk around the house naked but recently when I see her like that my ears just kind of perk up but I don't try anything. Should I try to engage with her in these moments? I can tell when she's in the mood and we engage when she does which is usually once but sometimes twice a month (in the span of months we see each, like on breaks). 

We have talked about our different sex drives and their importance to us but nothing really changed after that. I want to be respectful to what she wants but at the same time I don't want to feel like an old married couple that is done with sexual intimacy. I also don't know when or if we'll ever have sex and if doing so would increase her desire to be sexually intimate with me. I'm not going to pressure her into having sex or begging her to, when she's ready then I'll be ready too. Should I try to talk to her again about being more sexually intimate? Or should I try just making more advances again and brush off the fear of rejection? I love my girlfriend and I know she loves me, I just don't know how to handle this and I want her to feel as happy and comfortable in our relationship as I can without compromising some of my desires as well. Any insight or advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated! :)"
"How do I ask my boyfriend not to smoke oui’d around me? My (20f) boyfriend (21m) smokes a lot to help with his anxiety and insomnia. I’m glad it’s something that helps him, but the smell of it really triggers me. He has only asked a couple of times (with no pressure) if I would like to smoke with him, but his friends are very pushy about weed and other drugs too. I endured a lot of trauma as a really young teenager and as an adult through sexual/violent assaults, all 3 times my attacker has smelled heavily of marijuana. The smell of it brings me back and makes me sick to my stomach. I know it’s something he uses for his mental health, and I’ve tried to push him to make edibles to the smell would be masked or something. So far no luck. I’ve stopped spending the night because he smokes while I’m asleep and I wake up having panic attacks. I’m supposed to go stay with him and his family for a while after I am tested &amp; clear of covid, and his family lets him smoke so I know I’ll have to either deal with it there or tell him how it makes me feel. I don’t want him to feel bad about all this time he’s been smoking around me and I don’t want him to have to stop smoking, I just wish he would do it outside. I’ve asked before but he still stays inside. I don’t want to pull a guilt card to force him to change but I need him to understand why I react that way to it."
"hi, i am an absolute coward I, (17 F) has a huge crush on this girl (17 F) but i can't seem to have a courage to dm (direct message) this wonderful girl. My friends tried and tried to push me to dm her but my coward ass just stays there. I am so afraid if i tried to chat her she would find me weird or she would lose interest in our conversation and i don't want that to happen. She's so wonderful guys she sings these songs  so beautifully dkajdksks it's like she's an angel sent from above. I really want to get to know her more. I want to know how her day went. I want to know what music she listens to. The small things idhfjss. I also want to knoe how her mind works and all that stuff. I just don't have enough courage to said hi. I mean what if she says hello and that's it? I am afraid what the outcome would be. God i am so hopeless djajjdsj hELP ME"
"I think I am emotionally dependent on my boyfriend, want to gain my freedom. My boyfriend (23 male) and I (24 male) met 5 years ago in college. During that time i was going through a very dark period of my life.
Growing up as a child I was constantly exposed to domestic violence. I think now that my mother would often experience paranoia about somethings then would blame my dad for all of that. I was often asked (as a child) to take part in the conflict and state which one of my parents was right in the fight. Anyways all the trauma
I was exposed to made me into a super depressed, angry, malfunctioning teenager.
Because of the stigma we associate to depression and because I lacked of objective knowledge about mental health and mental hygiene I wasn’t able to ask for help or even recognize my problems and quickly fell into deep a depression which peaked in my 20s

When I met my boyfriend I wasn’t interested in a serious relationship (although i had previously looked for one, with very bad results), i was just at a point where I would let anything go and just not fight anymore about anything (not even all things that had always mattered in my life such us my main interests in science, arts, music,... I would spend my days in bed feeling empty, not even sad). Since the time he met me, it was super clear that he was very interested in me, much more than i was in him, but i was letting it go, so we would basically meet once a week regularly to see each other.

Not long after, he declared his love to me, and I lied saying that i was also in love with him. i think my depression made me do it, again i was just carelessly letting everything go).
He had other guys before me but it was just a sex thing for him and never actually fell in love for a guy before me. I instead had faced multiple romances before this and had a really disenchanted pov on relationships.

5 years later I think he is the best thing that ever happened in my life. Thanks to him I was able to ask for help, go to therapy and now my depression is no longer a constant in my life. I still go through periods where i struggle and sometimes i still see traces of my traumas in my behaviours  but I feel so much better. I finally got back to working for the things i think matter the most to me. And of course i fell deeply in love with my savior. Maybe to a certain extent, i might be dependent on him and that’s where the problem begins.

Attending the same college we spend a lot of time together. Now that lockdown has come to us we basically live together since march. His presence is so important to me it really makes me realize when my thoughts get really inappropriate and toxic. It gives me an objective point of view on my behaviours and how to change them, and of course i take care of him too. Now that depression is no longer an issue i was able to find how much joy we can harvest from taking care of the ones you love.

Lockdown rules have now changed and we are able to go back to our parents house, but eventually we won’t be able to come back to our college town. He’s going to go back on monday.
I’m truly devastated. I’m worried that without him i would go back to visit those very dark places i used to be in when i was all alone.
Going back home for me could be an option, but as you might imagine i don’t think i belong there. Too much trauma. I mean, I forgave my parents, i don’t blame it on them for what i’ve been through, i think we are all victims to a certain extent. My parents are now “grown up” don’t fight anymore (still live together) but greater issues have come: my brother and I facing huge depression and compulsive behaviour, my dad fighting cancer for years, still going through chemiotherapy these days, my mum being the only person in the home everybody feels like blowing off steam to. I don’t want to be another huge weight to carry for her and I’m not sure I would be mature enough not to let any psychosis overcome my strengths. So i think for me going home without being able to come back to my college town anytime is not an option.

I’m gonna stay here alone, trying to focus on my graduation and last exams but i know it’s not gonna be easy. It’s gonna be like going through withdrawal from all the support i would normally get from my boyfriend. He’s going to be well, his family is one of the cutest and full of true love. I’m gonna miss him.

So i just felt like sharing my story. If any of you guys ever felt dependent on their significant other and managed to gain their freedom please share your story. It would be very helpful to me. 

Thank you"
"My bf calls me cringy yet he is super cringy himself! My bf is 21m and I am 21f. He calls me cringy over stupid things that aren't even cringy, he's just embarrassed since he is kind of socially awkward. I assume this is why he calls it cringy since he feels weird and needs to point it out.

I could show him something and he won't be afraid to call it cringy and basically make me feel bad about myself.

Yet I can call him out on so many things that are cringy about himself. He plays video games and I get mad bc I hear him acting super cringy on the headset with his friends being ACTUALLY cringy and yet I don't call him on his shit.

This really fucking makes me mad bc I have told him before to stop calling me cringy. Like how can you be so insecure to the point that you have to call everyone cringy.

It's like he needs to say it to make himself feel better.

Advice pls bc im pissed over here."
"My (22M) boyfriend (22M) is acting distant due to personal issues and I don't know what else I can do to help (I also posted this on a different subreddit, but I'm trying to get different opinions and such)

Fist of all - technically he isn't my boyfriend. We went on few dates, hooked up twice and in general are showing strong romantic interest in each other (we used to send each other ""cute"" texts through out the day, would talk about missing each other etc.). Calling him my boyfriend in the title was easier than ""maybe soon to be boyfriend""

But let's get into the actual issue:

We've been talking/seeing each other for about 4 months now, and everything seemed to be going well. However he's been acting very distant lately - taking everything from 6h to 24h to respond to my texts and usually he only responds with one, very short sentence that ""kills"" the conversation before it even starts. Or he ignores what I said and says something unrelated. I decided to point it out to him at some point and he did admit that it's because the anniversary of the death of his close family member is nearing. I apologized and told him that if he needs anything I'm here for him, whatever it is. For the next few days I kept on asking if he's okay and if he wants to talk about it etc. He always replayed saying that he's fine, that's he's just chilling, but he continued on being super distant. I tried giving him space without asking how his doing, not double texting or anything like that, just waiting for him to respond and then taking a moment before responding back (that's something I appreciate when I'm not feeling mentally well) but he still does not hold conversation in any way. I tried ""flirting"" a few times (just stuff that we did before he got distant, like using pet names, saying that i miss him etc.) but he always pretty much ignores those attempts.

Maybe if we were in an actual relationship I would feel confident to talk to him about it, but because we're \*not\* I feel like I'm not allowed to ""demand"" anything of him. Basically I care about this guy and but I feel like I can't really do much in this situation relationship-wise without looking clingy. There is also this additional layer of the fact that we're both guys and even though I know it's stupid, I feel a bit emasculated by this whole situation (constantly trying to get him to talk to me about feelings, seeking affection with the flirting, getting attached to the point where it seems like I might care about this ""relationship"" more than him etc.)

TLDR; Guy I like is distant (probably) due to the anniversary of the death of his close family member, and I tried different methods of helping, but it's been now weeks and he continues on instating that he's fine, while also still being distant. I care about him but as we're not actually dating I feel like there is not much I can do."
"Broke up with my first love **hey guys this is pretty long so if you just want the jist of it theres a tl/dr at the bottom


I (F16) broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years (M17) a few days ago. He was my first boyfriend and first love, and I honestly still care for him a lot, but we started dating in the second half of our 8th grade year and then only got freshman year together before I suddenly had to move away. I remember telling him one day after summer school before I moved that, knowing myself, ""i might not be able to take it"". It being having an ldr for so long. I've never been good at making friends, or keeping them, so when I moved and suddenly my bestfriend ghosted me and I was alone in a new school again it hit me bad. I became really cold and rude to everyone, like I was a wounded dog barking at everyone near it. Not my proudest time. But surprisingly I was not only able to keep my relationship with him, but it helped having him with me, even if it was ldr. I started getting better with the support I had from him and my sister and by the end of sophomore year I had a few friends, though we arent very close and can be really judgy, they are friends none the less. Junior year comes in, I have friends now and I'm starting to be less cold but it's hard getting back to how I used to be especially since the people at my school arent really that open minded. They worry about clothes, the next trend, famous people, etc. Basic normal teenager stuff. I worry about the worm they step on with their fancy shoes they all brag about, about the bee everyone runs away from and tries to kill when it's not only quite a few feet from them, but just getting pollen from a flower. I want to talk about the state of our world and what we can do to change it, but that would be too much for them and ""cringey"". I'm a bit of an idealist if it isnt clear enough. A romantic I guess? But I get it, even I myself would feel weird talking about that stuff with them (though I wish I had someone to talk to that about), but I still appreciate them for making me tag along and making me feel less alone. Emphasis on less. The more my junior year went on, the more I realized how alone/unsure I felt. How much I was unsure of and how much I wanted to do and see and live but couldnt do and was told not to do and told I couldnt do (parents don't agree with what I want to be and do with my life unless it falls under the category of doctor, or lawyer.) And everything piled up and has been stressing me out for months. And with all that came two realizations. I've been feeling this way for a long, long time without knowing it, and that I already had my future set in stone. My parents want me to be a doctor, and have been getting me into things to prepare me for it. I'm in a health academy at my school, I regularly go to medical things (conferences?) At universities like UCLA, UCR, UCI, (which are open to the public and are actually kinda cool cause I get to learn new things but I also have to socialise and that scares me), and then me and my boyfriend had already talked about kids and marriage and all that stuff since early in our relationship, even his parents brought up how we could get married and then  move around together once he gets deployed into the army. And all this brought about another, yes another, realization. I dont want that. Well better thing to say is I dont know what I want. I've always been drawn to the arts but I've been shot down whenever I've brought up working in the art field to my parents, no matter how happy I'd be to tell them and the tears I'd cry afterwards. ""You cant live like that. How are you gonna pay rent and buy food and pay for college? When you're a doctor you get paid good and get to help people. What else could you want?"" And after all these years of hearing that ive begun to belive it in my subconscious. I feel like I'll die if I try to go into another field and that I'll fail in anything other than being a doctor. I truly do. Being a doctor seems so easy compared to everything else, I know it isnt and I'm not trying to belittle the harsh days and nights medical students face trying to make it as a doctor but I've been exposed to enough of that world that I know what I'll go through and I know I'll get through it. I've literally been trained into being a doctor since I was a kid. Both my parents were doctors in a third world country and used to show me pictures of people they'd work on that day no matter how bloody or gruesome it would be, so I'm used to blood, I get excited to see an autopsy to see the parts of the body irl to see if I'll recognize them- almost like a test to myself- while the rest of my class cringes and gags. My parents rarely came home from how much they worked (again, third world country, they worked way over 40 hours a week and basically lived at the hospital) and when they came home it was usually just one of them that came in to change their scrubs around 3am only to leave so the other could take a break and come home to get some clean scrubs and leave again. I've heard plenty stories of how much my mother had to study and how my dad had to get help from her cause he sucked at studying yet got pretty good marks (until he didn't, but that's another story and this is getting too long), so I'd say I have a pretty good idea of it. Its familiar. It's safe. But I dont think it's what I want. My dream job would most likely be a job where I can be creative, like writing or acting (though i can be a bit stage shy, but I still got through 3 years of drama class from middle school to freshman year and loved it.) Or being a comic writer/artist. But that's unknown and scary and the part of my mind that sounds oddly like my mother's voice tells me I wont be able to live in a good house or have good food or go to nice places (I also want to travel the world by the way so theres that but I get scared of that too cause I'm a woman and my mom has told me stories of her almost getting raped and all the men who have touched her or pointed a gun at her and shes told me how dangerous it would be for a woman to travel alone and I believe her). And then we finally get to the main point of this, my boyfriend. I met him in 6th grade. 6th!! That seems so tiny from my 16y/o brain though I know I'm not that old and one day I'll hopefully look back and think how tiny I was at 16...anywhoo, we were so tiny, so young. But we both liked each other immediately and dance around each other until our 8th grade year where I devised a plan to get his number (something I did so smoothly he never believed me when I said I planned it out (must be the actor in me)) and then he revealed he liked me and asked me out. Everything after that moved so quickly suddenly we were holding hands, hugging, kissing, and then planning our wedding??? Bitch. what. the. fuck. It scares me thinking about it. I dont want to get married young. I want to live and see the world and learn about myself and work on my dreams and just live. I dont even fucking know if I'm straight for fucks sake. Dont even know if I like sex for that matter. I dont know anything. The only thing I did know was that I wasnt (and still am not) in the right head space for a relationship, I was(am) too confused, too indecisive and worried, just too much. By the point I realized this our relationship had kind of flickered. We had never been really good at talking and mostly covered it by being more physical (something I did when I got nervous something was wrong, hence why I dont think i like sex or being too physical for that matter, because i mainly think of it from panic. That I have to do that or else its gonna be weird or awkward since we cant fucking communicate) and before I get told this, yes I have tried to talk to him, be open. I've told him so much about myself and hes been so supportive and unrealistically perfect and accepting about everything I told him about myself that it all seemed unreal. But when it was his turn to share he acted aloof and indifferent. ""Well theres nothing much to me"" ""I'm fine"" ""eh I feel that too I guess"" ""I'm not mad"" ""I'm not sad"" ""its fine"" and his most frequent/favorite response, which was my most hated response from him,  ""idk"". I had to dig and dig and dig to get something out of him, and I get it's hard to open yourself up to someone but we've been together for years by then, and I had time and time again laid my soul bare for him, but nothing. Only sometimes he opened up in response when I have a really bad day and he shared his experiences to cheer me up or show he related and that was sweet and all but is it bad that I wanted more? It was like I barely knew him really. Like if you asked me why I loved him I'd say ""hes unrealisticly nice and good to me"" sounds good right? But that's kinda it. we've never had a fight and I've never heard him complain about something I did unless I dug it out of him and even then itd be something silly to change the subject and distract me like  ""you have more of a mustache than I do"" and it'd be so funny and slightly insulting that it worked to distract me. He always made me smile and was always there for me, which is something I'll always be thankful for, but our relationship felt weird now. I had realized so many things in so little time I felt different. I wasnt the 13 year old declaring she would marry her 14 year old boyfriend when they turned 25 and then they'd have a few kids some years later that she would support with her medical job. I was (still am) just a dumb 16 year old so confused they can barely choose what to eat in the morning. So I asked him one day, and this was really the beginning of the end, ""dont you think we moved too fast?"" He was confused what I meant and once I explained he said no. It made me feel bad but I tried my best to explain everything I had been feeling and he pointed out that it sounded like I wanted to do things I couldnt do with him as my boyfriend. And what could I say to that? He was right. I was being selfish and rude. But I've told him many times before that I was selfish so I hope it wasn't too much of a shock.... I really do feel and felt bad... so after telling him that and hearing that (reading cause this was through text) I got really emotional and told him to give me time to think, he said he understood and to take as much as I needed. A few hours later I came back apologizing over and over. And he said he understood and wasn't mad, sad, annoyed, nothing. I honestly didnt and dont know what he truly felt. I tried getting things back to normal, but then I (once again for gods sake) realized our normal was talking every few hours about something random like, ""the candle in my room smelled really strong"" and things like ""hyd? I'm ok hbu?"" ""I'm fine"" ""wyd?"" "" reading hbu"" ""videogames"" ""nothing"". This kinda woke me up again and reminded me why I tried breaking up in the first place. Even if I was scared of losing him and scared of hurting him by breaking up, this wasnt a good relationship anymore. We weren't toxic or rude to each other... I feel like we were just burnt out, like some flame that flickered and then died but you refused to admit it and claimed you could still see some sparks. I didnt want him to be in a relationship like that. He deserved(s) so much more in life and someone he could truly talk to and open up to, even if that wasn't me. And I knew I had to break up with him for me as well, and because he surely wasn't going to, even if he saw we haven't been good for a while (which he did see and told me himself he had). I had to take the lead. So on may 4th, I told him straight up I wasnt in a good place (I've been really depressed/suicidal and stressed these past few months I had to talk to my own mother about it (well she somehow noticed and talked to me) and she saw how bad I was that she told me I could actually get therapy after the corona stuff is over which was really shocking to me since she doesnt like the idea of therapy at. all. ) and I had to end things with him. He said he saw it coming and (somehow?) understood. At this point were still talking and considering ourselves friends but I still have a lot of guilt and worry if I made the right choice. I never wanted to hurt him.... but a break up will always hurt. I'd appreciate to see what other people think of my situation and if it's me being crazy for leaving a pretty good relationship and being so confused or if I'm somehow ok in what I'm doing? Just some basic advice and opinions would be appreciated. Also thanks to those that have read this far, I didnt mean to spill most my life story but here we are lol.

Tl/dr: I broke up with my boyfriend of three years because I was confused about life and myself and have been feeling depressed/suicidal for a few months (I usually feel depressed but this time it hit me hard)"
"Failing to move on- need help I (25F) broke up with my ex (25M) on the new years eve of 2018. I was at his place, we were supposed to spend the new years eve and the day of new years together. We were doing long distance at that time as he moved to a different university and i was in a different university. 
Let me give you some back story: We had been together for 7 years on and off, I was the one who broke up with him always. I had my valid reasons- he lied to me constantly, flirted to different girls in different social media, used to talk to his ex gf, the girl who was the love of his life, he kept her pictures even after 2 years of our relationship. He was never good at communicating regarding anything that bothering him, instead he used to stop talking or just keep his distance, he made me give up my friends brain washing me to think they were wrong and they never liked me. I lost my friends then i lost my family.. He used to act like my sisters didnt like me or cared about me. I stopped communicating with my sisters and i created a world inside my head where there was only me and him. He didnt have any friends. I moved to the US on 2014 and he moved to the US the same year from a differenf country. He left his family to be with me because he felt that he needs to be close to me inorder for him to trust me. Here is the thing, I never cheated on him, unlike all of his ex gfs, I stopped talking to my friends even my guy friends. I tried to make him understand that he didnt have any reason not to trust me. 
After he came to the states, i spent as much as time and money on him for him to comfortable over here. So that he didnt feel left out. I spent all of my waking hours with him other than work, so that he didnt feel lonely. I spent all my hard earned money so that he would get what his father couldnt send him. I boughy him the camera and lense, which he uses now to photoshoot, even the laptop he edits in was my gift to him.. I bought gifts for his family too so that they get happy when he visits them. He is a broke university student..the point of me stating all of this is because after everything when I broke up with him, he told me that I never appreciated him, or the fact that he moved here. According to him it was my fault that he doesnt have a great relationship with his family including with  his little brother. Fast forward to the day I broke up- I woke up early because I have a hard time sleeping into places other than my own bed. He was still sleeping and my  phone was dead, i placed it on charge and i took his phone to pass my time playing games. When I noticed he doesnt have any of the games I used to play. He uses Android, so if you go to the play store and go to reinstall, you find all of the previously downloaded apps. As I was searching for the games I used to play I found bumble, tinder, hook up apps. I thought maybe he used it when we were broken up but my guts told me to look what was going on. I went to his emails, I found his conversations in Tinder and bumble and his profile too. He used it the week before I was supposed to come vist him. When i found out, I woke him up and he make some excuses that it wasnt it was his cousin, EVEN THOUGH THE PROFILE HAD HIS NAME. I left his apartment on dec 31,2018 at 7:00 am found an hotel for myself and cries all the way there. He didnt stop me. He was worried to create a scen. He called me later and came over to explain himself but I gave him too many chances and I didnt trust him anymore. I know everything I need to know not to be with him. But why do I feel like I am nothing without him, I will never find someone who will be stupid enough to love me.. Its been over a year we broke up. He moved on, has a girlfriend since last year. And I am still stuck and the worst part is that I have a terminal disease which makes things worse for me. I wish i could find someone to love me so that my insecurities and doubt myself went away. I have a good relationship with my family and I am working on making friends but who do I still feel like this. I want to and i need to move on- I need someone to tell me that I will stop feeling like this because it hurts. I hate myself for reminiscing him.

Sorry! My English isnt so great, please excuse my poor grammar!"
"Am I insecure or just not into poly? Me(25f) have been with fiancè(26m) for 5 years. 

Last year fiancè expressed interest in polygamy which I was unsure of at first but since he only expressed interest in pursuing men, I agreed. Our communication is pretty good and I expressed any concerns I had and we worked through them together. I said that I didn't think I'd be comfortable with him having female partners. I'm not really interested in having other partners myself but have said that should the opportunity happen I'd talk to fiancè about it. Eventually I became fully (I thought) on board and even enjoyed talking about his other partners with him. I said that if he met someone and there was a ""moment"" I was ok with any decision he made (because he'd tell me he's going out to see xyz beforehand).

Until he met ""Maddie"" (24f) online. Fiancè and I met online aswell so it's not unusual for us to have online friends and talk to each other about them. Maddie lives in another country and is also polygamous. Fiancè tells me that he has feelings for her and thinks that she has feelings too. I was a bit uncomfortable but I don't think that I said much about it at the time. One night he said that they'd exchanged sexual messages/pictures and it was a bit of a shock. I felt he violated my trust because he didn't mention anything really since the initial conversation and that he didn't talk to me about it first. He said he thought it was okay because it was ""in the moment"". Clearly I could have communicated better but I digress. We talked it out. 

Later he told me that Maddie was really special and he wanted more than friendship with her but that he wasn't sure if it would work because she hadn't told her partner that she is poly and that she actually has other partners (online only). I think I could have put more thought into this but he seemed so happy I said I was okay with it. She's overseas after all. 

However now I'm starting to feel a bit left out? I don't feel like my needs are being met and I'm starting to feel a bit jealous of the honeymoon phase they're going through. He's sending her really lovely messages (things he used to do for me) and spending a lot of time online to talk to her. Now I'm getting really in my head thinking that I'm not good enough and I need to compete with her despite knowing that he'd give up all his partners for me. Which is frustrating because I feel like I'd be taking happiness away from him. I've told him how I feel but I don't think anything has changed. 

When I'm living from my heart I love that they love each other. I participate in helping their relationship grow. But when I'm feeling a bit down, probably due to my needs not being met I feel terrible. 

I have noticed that I may be a bit codependent on my fiancè so that's something I need to work on but will focusing on my own interests help? Is there a better way for me to communicate my feelings? Am I just insecure or am I just not okay with polygamy? 

Please know that although I haven't painted Fiancè in the best light we do have a great relationship. 

I feel very confused. 

TLDR: Fiancè is in to poly and I'm not sure I'm ok with it anymore."
"Was finally able to speak up and say I don’t love you anymore. Now what? Over the past few days I’ve had the same text and verbal arguments with my SO that we’ve been having for years. I won’t bore with details because honestly, I’m sick to death of the repetition and have found closure in my feelings. I’ve been unhappy for years in the relationship and have stayed because of kids and financial ease for all of us. 

The last few days I’ve finally said enough and expressed clearly I want out. 
Unfortunately, I’m stuck living here for the summer due to our lease. 

Now he’s texting insanely, making threats of custody battles and insulting me, my parenting and spending habits. He’s making demands on how I need to treat him while we still live together and doing it in an arrogant and threatening way. 

I’m looking for any advice on how to stay calm and not let him manipulate me into exploding and backsliding on my goal to gtfo. 

How have you dealt with someone that purposefully pushes your buttons and manipulates you?"
"I’m in an exclusive relationship, and his anxiety is starting to take a toll. Do I make it official or end it?       I (F18) met my potential soon to be partner (M19) in mid January. In the beginning, it was great. He would constantly check in on me, shower me with attention, compliment me, etc etc. We talked non stop. We would have meaningful conversations and would FaceTime for upwards of 4 hours a day if we couldn’t hang out in person. He told me about some of his mental health issues and I made sure he knew that I was ALWAYS there for him no matter the circumstances. I was true to my promise and comforted him in times when he needed support. Even when he didn’t need me, I took it upon myself to make him feel wanted. This boy treats me like a QUEEN. 



We started saying I love you pretty early on. I mean in all fairness, we’ve only been talking for 5 months so it wasn’t too long ago that it started. I always tell people that I love them if I truly mean it. I told him about this, and he said that he had no problem with it as he felt the same. Now, we say it every night before bed or throughout the day if need be. He is extremely respectful and has never brought up anything that has made me remotely uncomfortable. Things seemed too good to be true. I was on a deeply personal level with an attractive individual who cared for me just as much as I cared for him. What more could you possibly want? His anxiety and other mental health issues never phased me. As a person who used to have severe separation anxiety (that has diminished greatly over the years with a change of mind), I could sympathize with him. I knew exactly where he was coming from. The anxious side of him that he had shown me was nothing I couldn’t handle. He apologized to me constantly over the smallest things. I would never get upset with him, but if my tone sounded even remotely off or if I took a few minutes to respond to a text or phone call, he would apologize profusely. Each time this happened (aka every five minutes), I would reassure him that it was okay, and that he didn’t need to apologize to me as he did nothing wrong. He would also constantly ask if I was mad at him which I never was. Once again, I would reassure him that everything was okay and I would make sure that he was doing well before we continued the conversation and changed the subject. 



Lately, things have taken a turn for the worse. It seems like all of a sudden his anxiety has spun out of control. What used to be chronic apologies has turned into full blown panic attacks and hyperventilation. He doesn’t care so much if I don’t respond right away, but if I show the slightest bit of lack of energy or enthusiasm, he FREAKS out. We’ll be on the phone and all of a sudden he’ll panic and start having a full blown melt down. Whenever this happens, I maintain a calm attitude and listen to whatever he has/needs to say. Ranting usually helps him and I really don’t mind listening. I give him my full undivided attention and give extremely thoughtful feedback and ask what I can do to help ease his stress. He always calms down after a while and I make sure that he’s  good before it’s time to go to sleep. 


I have no problem being a support for him, but I’ve noticed that whenever I need someone to talk to about any problems I’m having, he usually assumes that he is the cause of my unhappiness  and we get stuck in the endless cycle of him freaking out and me comforting him. In doing so, I can never get the support that I sometimes really need. He usually realizes what’s going on, and then proceeds to feel guilty for putting the attention on himself and tells me that it isn’t fair that I can’t talk to him about my problems. I tell him that everything is fine and not to worry, I don’t need anything in return, I just want to help you. 


As much as I try to be there for him, it’s EXHAUSTING. I’ll be in a good mood and then be swept into the therapist role in seconds. I love him. So much. This is just A LOT. Especially with everything that’s going on right now, I find it hard to keep myself sane, let alone be responsible for his sanity. We both REALLY want to make it official. We’re just waiting for things (ahem, corona) to improve so we have a happy start. I really want to date him. He is such a sweetheart and treats me better than ANYONE I have ever met, the only downside is that I can feel myself slipping back into a dark place that I just got out of. I guess I’m scared that if we do date, it’ll all be too much for me. Don’t get me wrong AT ALL, I know how much harder this is for him. Constantly thinking about the worst case scenario has got to be AWFUL and I have an insane amount of respect for him being able to hold it together sometimes. I NEVER make him feel like it’s his fault because it isn’t. I just keep second guessing whether pursuing this relationship is right for either of us."
"Heartbreak Crazy how even when you know you're better off and the relationship was toxic you still miss them like crazy. 

My ex and I were together for only 8 months but their are some moments I wish I could go back and feel that way again. We had a lot of the same bad habits mostly including alcoholism which would always lead to drunken fights. We broke up so many times but always went back trying to get better but this time the breakup is permanent.  He was addicted to porn and once I came across that I havent been able to shake the feeling of not being enough. It's been a week since we've talked but we work together and I'm scared once we open back up I'm going to cave and try and get him back... I guess what I'm asking for is advice on how to be strong??."
Am I wrong? I told my boyfriend I don't like being cornered or play fighting because I have been extremely abused and sexually abused as a child and he thinks I'm over reacting to his playful actions. He says he never has hit or hurt me so I shouldn't feel like that. I don't want to be sexually active a lot because of my abuse and he makes me feel guilty saying it makes him feel like I don't love him. Even after I've explained my abuse to him. Because it's been so long ago I shouldn't feel that way. Am I wrong?
"My (24M) girlfriend (22F) politely and enthusiastically asked me if my ex was better than her in bed. I said yes. Now she's mad at me......for being honest? Did I get baited? How is that fair? Am I just supposed to lie? 

My ex had more experience which is what I calmly explained to her. She just stormed off.

Is it normal for people to ""bait"" each other into saying something that will piss the other off?"
"My older friend is upset over his girlfriend posting about her dead boyfriend So my older friend, Who is dating my cousin is upset over her posting about her dead boyfriend. I am posting this for advice for him like I said he’s older doesn’t know phones well. Starting off my cousin is a good person she’s a tough woman but kind and works hard. Her boyfriend died in 2014 I believe from cancer, He was a really great man and her kids loved him a lot as well. She was emotionally distraught well to this day she makes plays about him. She remembers the day she met him etc like they were in love love. Well today is the day she met him for the first time ever and it made her emotional. So she posted like 10 years today is when I met the love of my life she even went as far as to say I’ll be with you soon. My friend is hurt by these posts these are off and on posts. I’m not going against my cousin but to this day she loves this man so much. If he was alive she would not be with my friend. Do you think my friend should leave he feels so bad about it? He’s been off on with her for like three years now. She hasn’t moved on she really loved that man..."
"a message i wrote for my ex, should I send it? [our story:- me and my ex best friend met 2 and a half years ago, we were together for a year, i told her i had romantic feelings towards her, she said she can't. 
and told her i understood, but i felt heart broken. i needed time 2 refresh and to push those feelings as far as possible because i wanted to be the friend she needed. but at what cost, 
a month later i got back to her, after completely having her cut off, to find her dating someone, someone that me and her used 2 talk shit about, that we hated. 
that someone manipulated past conversations of me and them to make me seem fake, and my best friend believed them, 
but after us getting back together i was able to find proof and my best friend broke things off with that someone, we stayed together...we were good...the closest we've ever been, till she started to talk less...n less.. till one day we stopped talking, i reached out to her after a few weeks.. she seemed cold. didnt wanna hold a conversation and i blocked her out of rage. contacted her after 2 months she told me she was being productive and didnt need me. its been a year and a half...and on all her social medias shes posting about how happy she is with the person that manipulated me. they got back together.] so if i were to send a message here's what i got, because i cant find it in me to move on. 


////""you really hurt me, you ghosted me....and u didnt feel sorry about it, why would you think its okay 2 do, did u think id get over it..within weeks? months? because its been a year and a half, and i can still feel hreatbreak. thats cruel...so fucking cruel, you never apologised, u dont even think ur wrong...like hurting me is equivalent to what i did, which neither of is know what that is, you just make me feel so fucking guilty for caring, you wanted me until u didnt, and put the blame on me so you could have it easier, its all my fault tho...our fucking friendship started by me saying ""i want to get 2 know you...i dont want small talk anymore, i want us 2 be close"" while you were making excuses to keep distance...thats already a red flag there, and i was 2 stupid 2 see it, you only let me in because there weren't anyone around u that showed thoughtfulness, concentration and affection.
thats why when someone else showed up, the second i was too tired to hold on, you picked them within a heartbeat. told me i wasn't good enough for you, and i wasn't as good as them. and it ate me alive, because these words came from the person i cared about the most, i reached out 2 u...telling you thank you for the lessons i learned...i was truthful as i always have been...but i lied about not telling you how much i missed you, i only texted you then so that you could tell me youre sorry, i wanted to hear ""this isnt you this is me"" crap even if we both know its bullshit, i just wanted to hear it. but all i got was ""I've been so productive...better off without you"", so please. please. tell me what i didnt do wrong...because theres nothing in me left to love because of you... tell me why you thought i deserved to be left out like that. tell me i would listen..i just need you to tell me.""////


can someone please tell me just how other way i can move on, because the person i love is too cruel, for me 2 get a caring answer from.

time wont heal shit, i feel the same ache from a year and a half ago. 

i can already see the comments about ""you need to love yourself to know yourself worth,"" and i get it, i promise you i do, i do know i dont deserve all this shit, but what must i really do?"
"I feel lost in my relationship On mobile, sorry for the format! 

Basically me and my bf met when I was F16 and he M15. We were classmates and had the same friend group. I had a crush on him so I decided to go for it and talk to him. At the end, I gathered up my courage, confessed, needless to say he felt the same, so we got together. :) 

Recently we changed schools (we’re not classmates anymore but we see each other a lot at school). During this time, we started our real fights (before fighting was nonexistent, ps. I know it’s a good thing to fight since its a sign that we’re going out of our honeymoon phase :)) 
All of our fights can be stemmed down to his jealousy and my apparent lack of attention for him at school. [Context: I’m not fluent in the language so I cannot express myself as good as I do in other languages + I have a bit of a shy side (which is a separate issue that I’ve already started working on, my progress has been really good so far :) )] Basically he didn’t like that I don’t interact with him as much at school [to which I had tried to explain to him that me being a foreigner + shy meant that I’m very reserved in public spaces]. I told him that I was trying my best, but it’s just that I’m not comfortable with interacting with him in public, not that I’m ashamed of him, it’s just that I’m afraid that people would think I’m not good enough for him( I know, it’s dumb, but bear in mind please that I’m a foreigner that sometimes speaks in broken language so I’m insecure about me speaking).My social media acc also posed a problem to him, the fact that I was following guys led him to believe that I was fishing for compliments and trying to basically replace him. (he basically accused me of this)I clarified to him that I used this only for school, but I’m not sure if he really believes me.  [Let me be clear that I have not once shown signs of being a cheater, due to me being timid, I rarely ever talk to other guys.] [Though I’m best friends with this guy who can speak my language so I always hang out with him (I explicitly asked my bf if he would mind if I hang out with him, he was okay with it) There were a lot more times that he would just get jealous, and I would feel bad and constantly say sorry. But if it were me who became jealous (which is rare, I trusted him so idk I think I just fake it), he would be happy because he thought it meant I loved him. But I don’t want to force myself to feel bad just for him to feel validated. 

His point of view in all of this is he would just feel constantly pushed aside, as if I put more importance in the relationship I have with my best friend that with him. He feels neglected that I don’t interact with him at school. 

I can’t fault him for feeling this way but his way of confronting these problems is what I can’t handle. He would just shut off entirely if something was wrong, ignore me for days and say nothing if I ask if there’s a problem. This made me really insecure ngl, I questioned my worth a lot during these times. It affected my grades too and school is really important for me.
Afterwards when he would finally cave in and say what’s wrong, even though I told him that his behavior is not okay, he justifies it as him wanting to make me feel what he felt. [Correct me if my thinking is wrong : I think it’s cruel as I hurt him unknowingly but him he’s doing it to me deliberately so it’s not really justified] 
We never really got around to solving this behavior problem, he just keeps repeating it. 
Basically it’s precisely this that triggered me to feel lost in all of this. 

So I was having family problems. I relayed to him that I was needing some comfort/ and maybe support for this whole situation. He reassured me that he would be there to comfort me. Prior to this moment he was already showing signs of having a problem with (avoidance at school, though I had asked he said nothing was wrong). I had asked for his company, to just be with me for awhile. When it was time for us to hang out, and you know just be together for awhile, he wasn’t texting me back. This went on for about 20 min until I just decided to forget about it. 
When I confronted him about it, he said that it was intentional that he didn’t want to hang out with me because he was annoyed at me (for something that I unknowingly did again). 

That was kind of the last straw for me. I feel as if I’m with a guy who doesn’t know how to communicate nor how to deal with emotions. I keep telling myself to get over it, because I feel like I can’t really blame him because I’m his first.
But I just can’t help but feel like my feelings aren’t validated. [I told him that I was really putting in effort to interact with him more at school but he basically told me it didn’t seem that way] [Told him, I just try to show that I appreciate him by making him handmade gifts, but he told me those were easy to make]. 
Now during the quarantine, I try to do activities with him so we feel close but he said that he doesn’t like those activities [i wanted to call, to play silly games with him online, video call]. So I don’t know anymore, am I just being dumb about this guy or what. The only thing we do now is text. And it’s draining me, I told him I wanted to feel closer to him since we’re far apart and since we’ve fought before the quarantine so we didn’t get to feel close before. He told me we didn’t need to do these activities to feel close. And I’m just sad, that’s all. 
It just feels like no matter what I do, I’m the bad guy? Or that I’m insensitive to him, that I focus too much on how I feel and that I’m toxic. 

Please tell me if it seems as if I’m in the wrong here, or if I haven’t given enough information (I’d be happy to clarify more). Sorry :( I’m well aware I’m not a good storyteller :( apologies !"
"I don’t want to deal with my best friends roommate anymore. I am still sorta new to Reddit in general so please go easy on me. I guess this has been a long time coming. My (21F) best friend (21F) has been in a bad relationship with her boyfriend (21M) for a little over 3 years. I say it’s bad because I know he’s cheated on her, though she won’t believe me because the account wasn’t under his name specifically. “No solid proof it was him.” Even though he was giving me very specific details about her (pretending to be her) when I messaged the account (she had asked me to). The details of that are another story. Other than that he’s been very controlling in the past, even guilting her to go to bed when he does saying that he wont sleep until she does and he’ll be tired for work and keeping her from seeing her other friends, including me. Though I guess things have gotten better in that department since it happened. He’s also always hated me despite literally never having a real conversation with me. Calling me names, going on about how I’ll never amount to anything, how much he hates me that I hear from her every time she brings me up. He nitpicks things he doesn’t like about her friends, I guess to isolate her. I’ve been pointing out the red flags since she started telling me about them but usually just writes them off. When I caught him cheating (above) she almost broke up with him but he somehow convinced her that she was crazy and it couldn’t have been him and they stayed together. Since then he’s always used the excuse that I somehow tried to break them up and he’s sorry if he hates me for that bc she means everything to him. Like a year and a half later, earlier this year, she convinced herself to break up with him and he basically proposed over the phone. He again talked her down to working on their relationship. Basically denying everything and making her feel crazy for even suggesting it. I’d been pretty adamant since that (more so than I always have been) that she deserves better than someone manipulative like that and that wasting 3 years was better than 5 or more. Though ive always been supportive when they were happy hoping that they had worked out their problems. It’s not my relationship and I’m not her mom and can’t tell her what to do, just support her decisions. Then tonight happened. My bf just so happens to have a sorta sporty car and when her bf heard he took a huge interest and insisted on adding him on sc right away. This was sorta the straw that broke the camels back because I’d been trying to at least get to know him since I met her (a little after they started dating) but like I said, he hates my guts and has never made an effort to even have a convo with me. When I told my friend I was upset about that she basically said that she asked and that he never felt I had made any effort whatsoever and I didn’t care about him. Despite the fact that I had always tried to at least say hi when he was over before he locked himself in her room, invited both of them to the kitchen for snacks, suggested we go on a double date etc. It really felt like she just sided with him right away saying that he said hi to me once and I just stared at him and it was awkward.  And even wrote me off when I pointed these things out to her. So now I basically don’t want anything to do with him and I don’t want to try anymore. Why should I when he’s always hated me no matter what I did? He only agreed to try to be civil since she almost broke up with him. But I can’t be around him bc he’s high risk for being a carrier for covid and I take care of my mom who would probably die if she caught it. And now he wants to hang out I guess. I love my best friend to death but I’m just talking to a wall. She won’t even really be mad at him, always asks for his permission. And evidently, won’t defend me to him. Sorry for the rant, I guess I’ve been letting this build for a long time and couldn’t sleep till I got it out. I’ll probably try to talk to my friend tomorrow and probably tell her I don’t want anything to do with him anymore. Any advice?"
"My 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend is coming up and I need some safe ideas on what to do I want to be safe, but I really miss dates with my boyfriend. So instead of going on a date, is there some fun games or something we could do at home? We honestly can't seem to come up with anything interesting. The past few weeks have just been us playing our separate video games or watching Netflix together. I was thinking about going to the park for a walk but I'm not sure how dangerous that would be. Any ideas on what we could do at home? Or do you think going to the park is okay if we keep our distance from people? It's not really that big a deal I would rather stay safe then worry about going out with my boyfriend, I'm just trying to do something different."
"I (35f) sent a funny YouTube video discussing a poly 4some to my SO (50m) Not on a throwaway because idc if my SO sees this. 

To give some background, when I met my partner 10 years ago, I was in a poly relationship. He didn't like it, so I left everyone and dedicated myself to only him.

I follow a YouTuber that watches these little docs or TV shows about different alt lifestyles and makes (what I find) funny remarks throughout. I don't think his comments are destructive. They're simply observations about the specific people that are in the show. 

I sent one that I found particularly entertaining about a poly 4some to my SO. They said they didn't find him funny. I said I wouldn't share his videos with them again and I thought we'd moved on from it. 

The first text I got from them today was a detailed documentary about what it's really like to date poly. 

I sent them a long detailed message that hits the following points:

- I have been poly, which they should have remembered. I appreciate the extra info but it wasn't really necessary of them to send me the documentary. 

- finding his video funny doesn't equal intolerance where I need to go enlighten myself on the lifestyle. 

- I think it's irritating that they're ignoring or have forgotten my past so that they could preach at me about something they've never taken part in. 

I feel like the fun has been totally sucked out of me because of this. Like I can't even share things I find funny if my SO doesn't because then I'm intolerant and they have to hold my hand and show me the light? Idk how to communicate to them that their reaction to this makes me feel like I can't be myself with them now. Like I can't laugh about anything I've ever done because they might shame me and paint me in this false intolerant light. I really don't know how to approach this now. I just feel like they've ruined alot of my comfort with their condescending behavior when I was just trying to share a laugh with them. 

Also, I'm not going to link the video even though that may be an important part. I'll pm to anyone who wants to watch it."
"OK: Does he like me or is he cutting me off slowly? Follow up. I need some balanced views on this. I'm really not cut out for this shit. I'm hormonal now and going from thrill to depressed. In a couple of days I'll get back to my senses, but still, I'm not cut out for flirting. I'm over 40, had my share of long term relationships and many short failures. But definitely I can't understand men when I like them.

[After this](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gfy8pv/i_think_hes_losing_interest/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) happened (in short: I was a bit cold and then froze when we finally saw each other after so many flirting  - we don't see each other often at work - we finally had a somewhat successful encounter) I wanted to see if after that he would say something, but at the same time I wasn't sure if after my coldness he knew I was interested, so I did initiate the talk. 

We have been flirting mainly through messages (emails), because we rarely see each other at work, there's also not too much time to talk there, but when we do see each other there was a lot of sexual tension on both parts. That I'm sure I saw. He showed all the signs ""experts"" say it's attraction. 

Even in this encounter, he showed some signs: he came closer, leaned towards me, smiled, was fun, teased me, went to see me on purpose (he didn't have too) though he didn't go so early has the day before (when I froze). 

So I emailed him. I wasn't expecting an answer by then. I cried and tried to forget him.

Later at night he answered me. I was excited. But then

it can be my hormones talking but I suddenly read it as if he's putting me in a distant place. 

This is a work situation, rejection could result in awkwardness and I believe no one wants that. I get it. We have to be subtle and make sure the other is realllllyyy into it before we make a bold move.

BUT...Now I feel like he's cooling it down to a professional level. 

I told him that I've made it, I was proud of myself. After my silly reaction the day before, I managed to act cheerfully as I should when I saw him and even performed well at work. And he too got a bit closer, which was good (we have been joking about getting too close to each other, how inappropriate it would be and so on). 

He answered all laughs and memes (so kudos for the effort): that I never let him down, I excel at work, and everyone at work likes my looks and friendliness so keep it up. He asked how close can we get with the pandemic happening? He wasn't so sure. Ended with a have a nice working weekend. Kisses (abbreviated to xx). A joke in the end with laugh to tears emoji about something else I said. 

Ok, so this first sounded good, but after reading it again I see some distancing language: 

I perform well at work (nothing about my reaction to him, how it made him feel). My team likes my looks and attitude (nothing about how he feels and what he thinks - it's always the others, the others like, the others think I'm nice, the others think I'm pretty). xx (nothing warmer)

I won't answer. I'm trying to move on. I know I'm in a down moment so anything I say will have a negative vibe. I'll be focusing on my work and life. I'm sad."
"Should I step out? I (20f) have been with my boyfriend (21m) for 2 years but I'm now wondering if I should be leaving for both of us. 
I've been staying at his house with his parents during quarantine and I thought that everything was fine between me and his parents but his mum had company over the other day (his family) and they called me by his ex's name before his mum corrected them. I wouldn't normally have a problem because we really don't see his family too much but they said that ""so they have one more year"" 

Am I supposed to take this that when we have spent 3 years together he's going to be done with me? We have our arguments but nothing over the top and honestly I have never know anyone in a relationship to not argue with their partner."
Long Term Girlfriend I have been Dating my Girlfriend for over 18 months and have had a wonderful relationship. I am lately feeling that we have been hitting a wall as we haven’t ever had sex together of any kind. I want to be able to take the next step in our relationship but she has said she isn’t ready for penetrative sex but wishes she knew how to please me. I am wanting how I should go about progressing our relationship.
Childhood friend I recently found my childhood friend whom I haven't spoke to since she moved away. (We were like 7 or 8 at the time.) Should I text her out of the blue? Is that weird? She's 17 and I'm 16. This is kind of embarrassing to ask help for.
"should i give up on a guy who enthusiastically makes plans with me only to cancel them this is my first time posting here, but i’ve been lurking for many years and you always seem to give very good advice. Sorry if it’s a bit long. 

I (32F) met Matt (33M) 6 years ago at a social thing, we hit it off instantly. At the time we were both going through some mental health struggles, him probably moreso. He’d make plans with me, such as a phone call, a video call or an actual date (we didn’t live close enough together to meet regularly) and he’d cancel the majority of them very last minute, the excuse was always family related ...his mum is ill and she asked him to visit her ...his brother had an accident and needed taking to the hospital ...his sister in law ended up coming round because she needed to chat. 
Every time it was a family emergency or event. Which made it very difficult to say anything other than “I’m sorry to hear that, I hope they’re ok”. I kept allowing this to happen as the times we did meet were really magical. 

This charade of him cancelling the majority of our plans went on for about 8 or so months, before he said he needed space to get his head sorted. I was going through similar emotions, and although it hurt, it was the right decision. He was incredibly hard to get over, it took quite some time as it felt so intense. 

About every 18 months since, he’ll check in on me via a message. We’ll chat for a few days and then leave it. Since lockdown, he messaged again but this time things felt different. He’d gotten therapy and was in a much happier place (as was I) and he missed me. We’ve been messaging and calling and video calling each other pretty regularly for the past few weeks and it had made me excited about future possibilities once lockdown is over. 

This week he arranged a ‘date’ via video chat. He suggested we dress up, have some food and drink remotely but together then maybe watch a film via netflix party. I loved this idea and I enjoyed spending the day getting myself ready like it was a real date. We were due to ‘meet’ at 8pm and I see a message from him flash up on my phone at 7.45pm. I don’t open it, I just read it from the notification window. He needs to cancel the date as his brother in laws dad who was in remission has just been taken back into hospital, his sister and brother in law live next door so he went round to comfort them. 

I felt so foolish. I’d spent my day happily preparing for a virtual date that he’d arranged. I didn’t feel angry, I felt disappointed in myself that I’d trusted him again. 

It is now the next morning and I still haven’t ‘read’ his message but he will have seen that I’ve been online maybe. I honestly don’t know what to say to him. If the situation was truthful, then I need to ask how they are, but my trust in him is now zero. What should I do?"
"How do I talk to my gf about masturbating? This is a throwaway account.

But ok so my girlfriend and I are both 20. For the past few years now, but especially lately, I’ve had a pretty big addiction to masturbating. I’d do it a lot like multiple times a day, especially with pandemic going on. My girlfriend and I still see each other but not often. But my masturbation addiction was getting in the way of our relationship. So about two weeks ago I told her I’d stop, cold turkey. I mostly wanted to stop for myself because I just didn’t like how often I was doing it. Well I made it a week without doing it. The next week I was at her house and while I had to use the bathroom I got the sudden urge to masturbate and I did. I thought about just trying to initiate sex but she was doing work, which I knew she had to finish and I knew if I did initiated it she would’ve went along with it, and, honestly, I just didn’t wanna have sex at that moment. I wanted it to just be quick so I did it. I told her about it because I didn’t think it had to be something to hide. Plus I was feeling a bit guilty since I do wanna stop. After telling her though she got very upset and accused me of lying to her when I initially said I wanted to stop and saying I didn’t care about her since I said I’d stop for us. I tried to explain to her how much of an issue masturbating was for me in the past and how even a week was an accomplishment for me but she disregarded it as BS. Now, I’m well aware that going cold turkey and never doing it again is gonna be impossible at least right now. But I’m nervous about doing it again because I don’t wanna upset her. And I don’t wanna lie about it. But I’m not sure how to approach this conversation. Any advice?"
"Ex was totally forceful, kept going and didn’t stop again. My (F21) ex (M23) is over my house and we are hanging out. He started kissing me out of no where and started fingering me vaginally and anally at the same time. I kept grabbing his hand and trying to push him away but he just kept going and increasing in intensity. I kept trying to push him away but he grabbed my wrist and held on really tight saying “No no no, you got this”. I said “no I don’t” and kept trying to push him off. He kept grabbing my arm and not letting me move. This went on for like def more than 5 minutes. I said “STOP” after he really started jabbing me and he slowed down and stopped. Instantly he flew behind me on the bed and whipped my pants down. This is where it gets raunchy, so please forgive me. Before I could even reach behind me to pull my pants up, he starting eating me out and eating my a** at the same time. He did this super hard and THEN started fingering me vaginally and anally while eating me. His nails are sorta long and he was doing it SO fast and hard. I kept trying to push him off but he just kept moving my hands. I gave up. I just laid there while he kept at it. What was the use if he wouldn’t stop? He finally stopped and I was feeling grateful that it was coming to an end but then he pulled his pants down and JAMMED his d*** inside of me. Everything he did was with a lot of force. He kept going until he finished. Aside from having dealt with that, now I have to deal with cleaning his mess- literally. He finished inside of me. I instantly got up and went to my bathroom. I’m sitting here now on the verge of fucking crying because how bad my vagina and behind hurt. Mostly worse in my vagina. I literally feel like I just gave fucking birth again. Every time I move it hurt so bad. I’m crying. I feel so fucking stupid. 

I already know I’m to blame for this because it’s my fault I allowed him in my house after everything we have been through. I REALLY thought we could be friends. I just feel so disgusted and ashamed of myself right now. 


TL;DR- my ex just hurt me a LOT and I don’t know what the fuck to do.

EDIT: For the people commenting saying “What did you think Reddit would say, call the police or delete the post”— sorry if I fucking offended you. I needed a place that I felt safe to ask what to do because I feel I am at fault.

EDIT #2- No, this is not made up. I wish it was. Thanks though."
"I (20M) want to do something for my Aunt(60F) I have moved out recently to live on my own, I call my landowner my aunt because I really consider her my family. She goes the extra mile to really give me the care and love I need when she doesn't have to. I grew up without a mother because she threw me away when I was a kid, and she tries her best to make sure I have everything I need. I also feel bad because she does so much for me, but in return, I can't really do anything about it. So since Mother's day is coming up I would love to write her a card and give her flowers or chocolate. Is this weird or too much?"
"Would people say 'thank you' to floor grocery store employees for working during a worldwide pandemic if it weren't for some sort of social media influence? I know I'm about to start some controversy, but please try to be as unbiased as you can. I'm am a (F28) T.V News reporter dating a (M29) grocery store manager. 

We got into a heated conversation where he told me that he was annoyed customers were just now saying 'thank you' because of COVID-19. His words- ""What? You didn't appreciate us before?"" I said, ""No, before you were just doing your job like the rest of us."" I explained to him- we all have a thankless job. I suggested that people are now saying 'thank you' because the media has highlighted how grocery stores are slam packed and employees are working extra hard to meet demand. He started blurting ""fake news,"" (which I hate) because most of the time it's not fake news. Yes, there are corrupt journalists who put their agenda first but most do not. I admit I'm slightly upset that most people don't know how hard journalist are working to provide news content to the public. Again, it's a thankless job. I have accepted that. I believe there are the select few who would have the foresight, without media influence, to say, 'thank you' to those working hard during this time.

I guess I would just like to have the publics opinion... Would people say 'thank you' to floor grocery store employees for working during a worldwide pandemic if it weren't for some sort of social media influence?"
"My girlfriend might be moving out of state So me and my girlfriend are nearing 3 months of being together, we're so happy and our friends say we're perfect for each other. 

Her family is thinking about moving back to where they came from, a state on the other side of the country. 

Do you think we could do a long distance relationship? Can we attempt one or will it end in a dumpster fire? 

I really really don't want to lose her, but I have no idea what's best for us.

Can y'all help??"
"I (16M) Need Help With My Relationship, Quarantine has been hurting it a lot So, I’ve been having issues with my relationship as of recent. It’s been really strange because this is my first relationship ever and I love her so much (16F). She’s my best friend and I love talking to her and watching movies and stuff but ever since quarantine, things have felt off. Things were fine when it started, and up until around a week ago, we got to see each other for the first time in two months and it was so fun. We went on a walk around the local lake and I we finally got to cuddle n stuff again. After that though, this past week has been very strange. She told me around 4 days ago she’d be thinking of breaking up, and just today, called me about it because she felt distant from me. She asked me “should we even still be together?” She’s recently been more harsh to me and a lot more self centered. It’s been extremely strange because she’ll randomly text me “I miss you” and things like that in this past week too. After we called tonight, she said she felt better about the situation and really doesn’t wanna break up, but I’m scared this weird phase will just keep going on for her even though I feel fine. She doesn’t even know why she feels distant from me, she doesn’t wanna call or anything (we only called to talk about our relationship.) I love her so much and she insists she loves me too but this last week has been so weird and she hasn’t been talking to me nearly as much. We’ve been together for around 9 months now, and I don’t think that we should break up because when I see her again in person I feel like we’ll be just as happy as usual. I don’t know if these kind of rough patches are normal because this is my first relationship, what do you guys think? I know it’s only a week so far but I’m not sure if that’s short or long relationship wise. Her feelings fluctuate so fast so I never know how she really feels, even when she tells me. Right now she says she doesn’t wanna break up and the call made her feel better and that she loves me. I just feel uneasy and I really want to be with her still. Do you guys think it will be ok from what I’ve said? I talked to my Dad about it and he said it’d be good. Are weird phases in relationships like this normal, especially at young ages like mine? Thanks guys."
"Depression, sickness, 1.5 year old daugther. Where is the love? I (30M) have a sickness that affect my immunesystem and makes me tired.
My girlfriend (28F) have a depression and stress.
And we have a daugther 1.5 years.
We have been together for almost 8 years.

So on a daily basis it often feels like a battle just to survive each day. 

We care very much for eachother, but it's hard to feel the love. Sex is rarely on the table (neither of us feels like it) and when we have sex, well it's nice but also boring and hard to keep passion up.
We kiss and each night we cuddle up.

Her depression have lasted for over a year and shows no improvement and my sickness have very little chance to improve.

How to reignite the passion and love ?"
"I (26F) felt hurt by my boyfriends (27M) actions and told him. He dismissed me and blamed me. Am I in the wrong? Yesterday my BF planned to hang out with his friend after work and probably wasn’t going to see me. So, because we had no plans I decided that I would help someone out with catching a stray cat and taking it to a vet. I had caught the cat at 3:15 and was about to go to the vet when my BF texted me and told me that his friend cancelled so he was going to come over instead (we don’t live together, but he’s over frequently and has keys). I called him, no answer, so I texted him telling him the situation and that I wasn’t home but would be home soon.

I got to the vet and just as I was finishing giving them information he called me and I said I was just talking to someone and leaving soon and would be on my way. Texted him a few minutes later to let him know I was on my way. 5 minutes before I got to my house he told me he was going to leave and go workout at his house so I could spend time with this cat (he misinterpreted and thought I found a cat and was going to keep it). I told him I would be there in 5 minutes and I just dropped the cat off. He said he would wait 5 minutes. 

I show up to my house 5 minutes later (3:50) and he’s not there. I call him a couple times, goes straight to voicemail, so I text him asking if I upset him. He said no, his phone was dead. Then I felt upset because he was at my house and couldn’t bother waiting to just see me for a couple minutes when he changed plans last second while I was doing something. I struggled with telling him this but ultimately decided to just text him that I felt bothered that he left when he said that he would wait for me and I wanted to see him. He told me that I should have communicated better and wouldn’t answer me when I asked him what I didn’t communicate. 

I then told him that I just wanted him to acknowledge that his actions hurt my feelings instead of dismissing them, but he doesn’t feel like he needed to. 

Am I overreacting??

TLDR: My BF didn’t wait for me to get home and left just before I showed up and didn’t acknowledge that I feel hurt by that."
"I feel like she’s disappointed in who I am I’ve been seeing this girl for a little while. I like her a lot but I feel like she’s kinda meh about me. 

She was so keen to meet me and go on a date. When I met her I can’t tell if she liked me or didn’t. She slept with me on the first date and stayed out till 3am talking with me. But I just couldn’t read her. 

The next date she told me I was ‘incredibly shy’ on the first date. I think this was a bit unfair because I came out of myself once I got past the anxiety (I have GAD). She said she ‘expected me to be a man slag’ and I feel I almost disappointed her I wasn’t. 

She said what I wore on our first date to a wine bar was tacky. She said the white laces were tacky on my shoes. I wore black vans with white laces, dark blue jeans and a black tee with a white Santa Cruz label on the left chest. I don’t think that’s that bad? 

She said she wants to keep seeing me and I make her happy. But I also feel like I’m disappointing her. 

Not sure how to deal with this?"
"My(20f)“Best friend”(20f) of 10+ yrs ghosted me but I want to reach out and get closure * I am not the best at explaining so this might seem all over the place sorry *

Basically me and this girl never fought we would have healthy arguments and end up talking out our problems. As she started dating this guy (that I warned her not to) she became so distant. I don’t want to get into how HORRIBLE of a guy he is because that’s a whole other story but basically he was so manipulative that he got my own brother to stop talking to me for 3 whole months!! She claims she never knew of all the stuff he would say about me or my family to other people but I would eventually always find out. She’s never defended me against this guy and I didn’t say anything because I was so done with her anyway. It’s important that I bring him up because she was never like this before. Slowly, she would randomly stop talking to me for days and send very short msgs like “yea” “hi” “I was busy” to someone she talked to every single day for the past 10 years. I would then ask her what’s wrong what did I do? And she would bring stuff up from literally 6 years ago. 

Back in grade 6/7 she would vent to me about her feelings and what’s been going on with her (she’s had some mental health issues) I would of course give her the best advice I could but never knew how deep things were since she did share more with others than her own best friend (and I didn’t know what mental health truly meant until like grade 10) Honestly, at a point I got sick and tired of her complaining every single day about how a single inconvenience to her was like everyone is out to get her and one day I told her “just shut up” I was 12-13 y/o probably and having my own problems. I just wanted her to ask me how I was doing sometime but that would never happen and I guess I just had enough. 

Down the road I one day apologized to her about how I wish I could have helped her and handled  things better and am glad she’s talking to professionals who can actually help her and we had a nice talk 

Back to when she starts acting distant, she would have her phases on when she wanted to talk to me and when she didn’t. After 3+ years of this back and forth we finally stopped talking for good. She hit me up asking for her clothes back and we returned each others clothes. She didn’t give all mine back and I asked her to drop them off whenever and she never got back to me. I kept msging and she ignored it every time. A little bit after that, she blocked me on everything including my family and my other friends. I was so confused because there was no argument, no talk, she just blocked me WITHOUT returning my other clothes. 

It’s been almost a year since we last talked and I still think about it a lot. I have always been a good friend and wanted the best for her. The reason why I even thought to reach out was because a lot of people started Msging me months ago asking about where she is and if she’s okay since they still thought we were the inseparable best friends that we once were. I lied to them and just said she’s probably busy with exams. I even called her 2-3 times to check up on her literally going out of my way even tho we haven’t spoken for almost a year. She never got back to me. I just want to know what she has against me and why she decided to completely block me out of her life. 

I am debating on whether I should reach out and how or if I should just take the hint and move on??"
"He wants to wait Hello,  I'm pretty new here to Reddit and this is my first actual post. 😅  I have a question for you guys and I'm hoping that maybe you can help me out.  

 So, I have just started dating a new guy. He is really sweet to me. Makes me dinner after work, makes me drinks,  gives massages and watches shows I like with me.  He says he hasn't had a girlfriend in over 3 years and is constantly telling me how much he likes me.  He's very open and affectionate.


I have spent the night with him on 2 separate occasions and we have done quite a lot sexually, but he says he wants to wait to actually go all the way. He says he feels like he isn't going to last very long and that he wants to ease into it. Because it's been so long for him.  

Is this a thing? I don't understand. 

I have told him that I don't mind if he doesn't last a long time and that sex isn't just a means to an end for me. There are still other ways to get off without penatrative sex. I am totally fine with waiting because I don't want him to feel uncomfortable with me... 

 I guess I just don't get it because we've been very sexual with sexts &amp; pics and have hit all of the other bases.  I'm just wondering why he is so nervous. 


Thoughts? We've been seeing each other for 2 weeks. I'm 33 and he's 34."
"Can't stop thinking about this girl in my dreams So I will just go straight to the facts. (Btw I'm on mobile blahblah, english is not my first language blahblah)

I'm 25m and I have those kinda really realistic dreams. The can be some work days or something like that which feel real. And sometimes it happens that I get to be in a world which looks like earth, but not the parts I know. But what is always the same are the people I know in irl appear ind this dreams.
And there happens to be this coworker I had. In my dreams we have a pretty decent friendship and already kissed a few times. And now, cause my dreams feel so real, I can't get her out of my head, even tho I'm not in contact with her anymore.

Is there anything I could do to trick my dumbass brain to get lost of those ""fake feelings"" for here? Does anybody had a similar situation?
Thanks for any kind of advice!"
"Is it wrong that I’m mad because my boyfriend keeps saying I gave him an STD? My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months, and I do have an extensive sexual history but so does he. About 2 months ago these little bumps started showing up on his penis, no itching or anything just bumps. From day 1 he kept saying he has HIV and insinuates that I gave it to him. He says if it’s not true I shouldn’t be offended but I feel like not only am I offended that he keeps pushing that I gave him something but that’s it’s also hurting my self esteem because I feel “dirty” about something I’ve never even thought about before this. Am I wrong for being mad?"
"can't cum off bj's I am 36. I have had a LOT of blowjobs and I've never came off of one. The only time I have ever come close is during a 69. I get bored.

"My friend's life [17F] is falling apart Well i don't even know where to begin,

I met this amazing girl back in February and we got pretty close.

Well she opened up to me and everything is fucked up.

Her boyfriend [m17].  Hits her, has sexual intercourse without consent, takes condom off mid sex, degrades her, controls her 

Her mom has terminal cancer and her she can't go live with her dad because he's a POS,
And she thinks her step dad won't take care of her.

She has chronic 
leukemia but it's in very early stages so that's the least of her problems.

I recently admitted i have feelings for her and she said she felt the same way but doesn't know how to leave, since he has pictures of her etc, 

I don't know what to do, 

I'm not enough for her in the first place.
I take too much drugs and I'll just take her down the rabbit hole with me.

It's to much, to soon and i don't know what to do.

It feels like I'm in a movie.

I want to help her and i have but i don't want her to end up like me as well."
"Can being is an abusive relationship turn me back to being straight?  I'm gay and just got out of a two your relationship with my gf that was physically and verbally abusive. I was also forced into having sex when I did not want to. Now I can't look at girls the same and want something to do with them. This is resulting in me wanting a boyfriend and I can't stop thinking about boys?!?

I am a 23 year old female. I have identified as gay to myself for the past 7 years, and publicly for the past 5. I have never shown interest in men, not even before I knew I was gay. I always got along better with guys though and prefered to chill with them over girls, probably because they tend to be more laid back and match my personality. But the thought of being with them in any romantic or physical way has always made me uncomfortable. I did date a boy once and slept with him in highschool but it was sooo unmemorable and not enjoyable that I knew I was gay right after it happened. Ever since then I have exclusively dated woman and have been confident in my sexuality. But ever since getting out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend, I can't look at woman the same. I find myself looking at men and wishing I had a boyfriend. Is this just a weird ptsd thing from my ex? Or am I actually turning straight?  Has anyone ever gone through this?? Please help me!!!


To give you a little more detail on what my relationship was like.. 
I just got out of a 2 year relationship. (Broke up in January 2020, officially stoped talking April 2020) I lived with this girl for the 2 years and it was the biggest mistake I could of ever made. She was emotionally, physically, and verbally abusive. She was mentally unstable and needed medical help but was not willing to revive it. (She went to the doctor after we broke up recently and got diagnosed with bpd and possibly schizophrenia. Which includes manic depression, bipolar, and anxiety) But because she never got help, I became her solution. She became reliant on me for her happiness and well being. Which turned into me not being allowed to leave the house to see my friends or family, I had to lie and say I was going to work if I wanted to go home for a family dinner. I lost all my friends and didn't speak to a single one for the entire two years. I had to ask permission to eat, shower, and to use my cell phone. She did not have a job because she said she had to much anxiety for one, so I was providing the income for the both of us. But I worked as a server and could barely afford to fund myself let alone two people. I am now $30,000 in debt just from her. But if I didn't have the money for something that she wanted, all hell would break loose until she got what she wanted. She would have what she calls a black out, and scream and cry and throw things and threaten to commit suicide and hit me, drag my down the hallways from my hair until I gave her what she wanted. Then claim she didn't remember a thing because it all happened during an anxiety attack, or a ""black out"". She would tell and call me dumb, say I'm a fuck up, immature, that I couldn't do anything right and that shes amazed that I'm even functioning. She completely ruined my self-esteem and has made me the most anxious and shy person. I can't to out without thinking I'm doing something wrong. For example, she would scream and hit me in superstore for bagging groceries the wrong way and make me feel like a complete idiot saying everyone's probably starring at me thinking I'm some dumb young blonde who doesn't know how to bag food. Now I can't go shopping alone because I need someone to bag my food for me since I have to much anxiety about other people watching me bag food. I'm scared to go hangout with people now but I just get really bad social anxiety and end up staying at home. I also can't afford to go places anyways because I'm poor all the time because I owe so much money to so many different people and places. She also cheated on me multiple times during the two years. But if I confronted her about it, she would flip the situation around and it would become my fault that she cheated and I would be the one apologizing in the end. I'm a huge push over I know, but I hate confrontation and I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and like to assume the best in people. Her cheating made me not want to have sex with her, because I fell out of love with her. She forced me to have sex. I would be crying the entire time, but id try my best to hide it so she didn't notice or else she would of gotten upset. So because of all of this, I am fucked up. If a friend does something to me that makes me upset, I get confused. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to be upset for that reason, I have to call a different friend and explain the situation and ask if it's ok to be upset about this. I was so use to getting yelled at for speaking up about something that made me upset, so now I let people walk all over me. But it also has made me have major trust issues. But combining trust issues with me not knowing if I should get upset is a bad combo, and my mind is racing with a million different thoughts that I don't know if I should or should speak up about.


ANYWAYS. I could go off about shit she did for hours. Moral of the story is she left me fucked up, extremely depressed, feeling like I missed out of the last two years of my life, friendless, not able to or want to have sex with any female, anxiety filled, poor, and with zero self confidence. AND NOW I FIND MYSELF WANTING A BOYFRIEND.

I was watching that new Netflix show Never Have I Ever, and the boy Paxton in it was soooooo cute. And I couldn't stop crying while watching that show because everytime Devi got happy about something her crush Paxton did I cried and got jealous because I wished it was me! I wanted the show in two sittings. And cried the ENTIRE TIME the two days it took me to watch. Now I can't stop thinking about boys. To the point where I went and had sex with one again to see what it was like. 

It. Felt. Like. Nothing.

I didn't hate it and get uncomfortable as I usually do, but I definitely did not enjoy it. This guy was a friend of mine so I was comfortable around him so that could be why I wasn't uncomfortable. But I did not get off or anything. I felt the same before it happened then after it happened. But I keep looking and checking out guys now. 

I still am attracted to females, but I'm having a hard time wanting anything to do with them. I have a girl who is super nice and we have made out a bunch the past few months, but I just can't seem to be intimate with her. After the sex my ex forced me to have with her, I don't see sex in the same light. It's something I don't want to have with girls anymore. It gives me anxiety and the thought of it makes me panic. I almost had sex with this girl but I got nervous right before and asked to stop. 

I honestly never want to have sex. My next relationship I want to have no sex in. But with that being my opinion, it makes me start to think about how no one would want to date someone who doesn't like sex. Then the negative thoughts come out, ""I'll never be with anyone ever again"" ""no one will ever be able to love me"" and shit like that.

I am so certiain on not gaving sex with woman and not wanting anything to do with them, yet I can sleep with a boy so easily? And now can't stop thinking about wanting a boyfriend? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?! Feels like i am questioning my sexuality all over again and it's stressful. So if anyone has every been gay then went straight, please tell me how you came about that decision. Because if I ever decided I was straight I think it would be harder to come out as straight again then it was to come out as gay originally. Or do you guys think this is because of me resenting woman because of my ex and I just need to take time for it to pass? Because Paxton from that show is looking really cute and I can't stop thinking about it and getting depressed at the thought of my never being able to date him. 

HELP"
"Feel like my boyfriend lied about his past girlfriend He was with her for 3 years...he told me that he didn't want to marry her, but then he also said that - whilst he would not want a stag do before our wedding - his dream when he was 18 was to have it in Vegas. So, he's basically matured since then and is more sensible. However, they were 18 when they started dating... so surely he must've considered marriage with her then? Does it sound like he's lying to me?"
"Is this guy hitting on me, regardless of his girlfriend? This guy [26M] I took classes with at undergrad followed me recently on twitter. I quoted something of his a mutual retweeted so he liked it, followed me, liked about 2 more of my tweets. I followed him back, and that was that. A couple of weeks afterwards, a mutual posted him on his story so I followed him on Instagram. He followed me back.

A couple of days after that, he began liking my tweets, I liked some of his that were related to my interests, etc. I never thought it was strange since I mean, that's pretty normal. He has a girlfriend, I also have a boyfriend. I posted a story about a poll and he answered, and so we kept talking about the topic in our DMs for about 3 hours then I got bored and didn't answer anymore. A couple of days afterwards he posts something exactly related to that topic, so I react to his story, since we had spoken about the topic, and he answered some emojis. I answered, giving him advice about something related to the topic and then he started the conv again. He asked me to add him on FB to send me something (related to the topic) from FB so I did. We spoke for about an hour, then I didn't answer anymore.

Now he likes my tweets every single day. Even if it's a boring, nonsense tweet, he likes it. If I post a story, he's like the first person that watches and then minutes later I receive a notification that he liked a tweet.

My boyfriend feels his intentions aren't good and I feel that my part is completely friendly but can be misunderstood. What do you guys think?

TLDR This guy, who has a girlfriend, from undergrad I took classes with but never really formally met has randomly upped his interactions with me and I'm skeptical of his intentions and don't wanna come across as interested in something other than normal friendship"
"Advice on my rs My girlfriend (22f) and me (25m) are together for about 1.5 years. Every month during her period, she gets very cranky and says that I trigger her easily. And when she is upset she says I tend to say the same things (eg DONT want to lose you and I love you) triggering her even more. She also says I’m not interested in the rs and that there is no effort from me in continuing the rs. I really love her but I don’t know if how can I handle this on a monthly basis? I know we are suppose to be with someone at their worst and be with them. I have thoughts of breaking up but I have no balls but also I feel she is the one. 
Also last week, I Skyped with my friends to chat cause we were bored but I didn’t tell her and after I told her about it that night. She got angry with me saying I don love her because I did not update her and that couples should update everything. 
I’m at a loss and hope to hear from someone. 
Thank you."
"My boyfriend (25/M) has mild autism/adhd and sometimes he has unrealistic goals Ok so we are both 25 and have jobs but are not working full time so money is an issue. Since I have known him he has wanted to make a comic, he wrote 2. They are unique but not crazily exceptional (more important later). He is ok at writing and the backbone of the script is there with good ideas.

He has just invested a lot of time and money into getting artists to 'draw up' his comic characters. I don't even know where he finds these people. He used to hide this from me because he would easily spend $200 on a character to be drawn and we just did not have the money. We now have an additional joint account to ease my anxiety on his spending so I can see he is saving for us. He understands thats maybe it was a bad idea being so hopeful before but he is still very stubborn and doesn't understand the bigger picture. He also got annoyed when an artist didn't progress on his story for over a year. I knew this would happen as he can't expect people to do something for free. He has a person 'working on' another comic for him but I can already see the same thing happening. He already has paid this guy money to draw some characters, but no actual storyboard has been made.

He is quite good at drawing himself but denies it and will not make it himself. I have tried to persuade him but he just wont as he wants others to do it so it will be 'perfect'. The people's art are exceptional and there's no way this is going to happen because they think his story is good to draw, its just too much to do for free in this day and age.

He wants to make money from it in the future, which ok I understand and support but again, maybe he needs to step back a little? I don't understand why he wont just try to draw it himself with his touch and art style, as he has the vision and the time to do it. I also don't get why he can't just start as making it a little book to print off for his friends and family?

Any advice?"
"Married man’s intentions?? I (F 26) have been friends with a married man (M 38) for a few years now. We meet via consultancy work. 

We got along really well and had a lot of common interests. About a year ago, he started to complain about his wife. It felt to me that he was very unhappy and wanted an escape. 

Fast forward a couple of months (mid 2019) and he is still telling me about everything his wife does to annoy him and the issues they are having with one of their children. All about his childhood and upbringing. All of this was unsolicited. By this stage, we have gotten quite close and I started to have feelings for him (yes, I know. This is frowned upon). I told him this and he said he was loyal to his family. 

Through our work, we ended up spending quite a bit of time together over the next few months. Talking everyday either through text or calls. Seeing each other a few times a week. Our work was generally what we talked about. But he would still tell me all of the issues he was having at home (he definitely knew how I felt). He would flirt (my perception of flirting) with me and make inappropriate jokes. It was hard to tell if he was like that with everyone. When we would be alone together he was just his normal self. But as soon as another person joined our conversation he would begin some banter with me and making inside jokes that only we understood. 

Everything has died down a bit because of COVID-19 and we don’t currently have any work together. 

From my end, it seems like he may feel something towards me but I am unsure. What do others think?"
"After a long relationship, I’m trying to become a better partner in a future relationship. I hope I’m not breaking any rules but I would like advice on how to view relationships in the future.

	My(23M) ex(22F) broke up with me over 7 months ago. Between then and now, we have had a bit of back and forth about getting back together. I ended things one last time out of frustration a few months ago. It has been hard for me but I’m chugging along. One of the main consistent reasons for the break up was that I was too jealous and controlling. She would tell me this during our relationship as well. I tried very hard to control my feelings and actions but I failed. She was my first serious relationship therefore it was a new experience for me. I’m not looking for judgement on what I have done. I know I messed up with the way I acted. I grew up in a rather conservative household. I was taught old school ways of thinking about relationships such as being in control as a man. As much as I tried to, I couldn’t overcome my jealousy. At the moment I don’t have anyone to turn to for well rounded advice. I would like advice on what is normal in a relationship and what isn’t. I would really like to be a better person in the future and change my way of thinking. For context I will provide some examples of my jealousy. 

	I never had a problem with her past. All I ever asked of her was to be honest with me. She had told me about this guy who she shared her first kiss with. She was my first kiss. She lied to me about it and said I was her first kiss too. Okay we talked about it no big deal. I found out however she kept talking to the same guy. She claimed they were just friends. At first I shrugged it off but I lost my cool when months later she casually mentions going out with him. I told her off but she blamed me for overreacting and being jealous because nothing happened and they never really dated. We talked about it and made up. 

	She would get a lot of attention in the workplace. I wouldn’t mind since I get attention too. I had a problem with the way she responded to it. There was one guy who would give her rides and stuff and they even had a thing at some point. I found out about it when my ex showed me a message from her friend by accident. My ex had told her friend we had sex and her friend immediately assumed it was that other guy at work. She was even telling him she loved him well into our relationship. I understand you can love a friend of the opposite sex. But the whole situation had me dying inside. She would tell me about this cop that would come by and usually bought her a coffee drink. She even had his picture in his contact. She insisted that he was just a friend. In a new job she got she would go to lunch with someone who would constantly confess his love for her. I advised her not to but she claimed she talked to him and they were just friends. He even tried to follow me on social media at one point. Another man well into his 30s promised to take care of her with all his money. She would just let him talk to her like that. When I tried to tell her that I was uncomfortable with that, she defended him saying he was very respectful and didn’t mean anything by it. I lost my cool and even spied on her on some of these guy’s social medias. 

	The last year or so of our relationship, I got a new job to have a better schedule and spend more time with her. Shortly after, I noticed she would do anything to go to the gym or hang out with her friends and always put me after them. This would also make me jealous at times. I posted some pictures of us together but she rarely did. If she did they were quick ""stories"" that would disappear after a day. I talked to her about it but she told me she was a very private person. Okay understandable. But she would then go and post about her friends at the gym and the stuff other guys would give her. Again my jealousy got the better of me and I confronted her about it. We talked and made up again.

	Every time we talked about situations like the ones above, she would put all the blame on me. She would tell me that because I came from a conservative ""prude"" of a family I thought the same as them. She would make the point that no one likes a jealous person and how she is totally not jealous. Ultimately she gave me an ultimatum, either stop being jealous or break up. I didn’t want to lose her so I agreed. I didn’t tell her anything anymore and left her alone. Ultimately a few months later she broke up with me. She again made it clear that my jealousy was too much for her and that I didn’t treat her as an individual. She said that I was too controlling and that I was possessive. She said I would never change. She said all this up until the last time we talked. Even after I basically gave her what she wanted. 

	This whole time I’ve been beating myself up for being too jealous. I’ve been a mess. Again I’m not looking for validation. I’m looking for advice on what is normal for being jealous. I know I made mistakes by acting on my feelings. At times I was overbearing. At a certain point I did asked her to cut down her time talking to other guys. However, I do not want to make the same mistakes again. So I ask, should my partner be able to do whatever she wants? Should I be okay with them being friends with people who want more than friendship? Should I trust everything they do? Does jealousy have any place in a relationship? If so, what is acceptable?

Thank you."
"was my boyfriend (M22) being cold or was it an appropriate response to my (F19) text? in one day it will be a whole year since my suicide attempt and i’ve come sooo far since then. in may i realized how close it was to being a year since then and have found myself thinking of my progress. i didn’t realize the date until today and i texted my boyfriend of over two years who has seen me at my worst, that it’ll be a year since then and i wanted to celebrate (jokingly obviously... there’s a pandemic) but basically just said i can’t believe it’s been a whole year, how much things have changed. and his response was “how do u know the date” that’s it. am i wrong for thinking the response was cold? we haven’t talked much about my depression or attempt since... so maybe he’s not comfortable talking about it? still, just thought maybe he’d say something like “i’m proud of you” . Perhaps he’s right and it’s weird I know the date. I don’t know."

"Worried for my sister’s health and safety Before I (16F) start this off, although I know it’s unlikely, I just want to please ask that this not be reposted on any other social media (Instagram, Twitter, etc.) because I don’t want any family members knowing that I posted this. Again, I know it’s INCREDIBLY unlikely that this even would BE reposted but I just wanted to say it. 

Warning, this is going to be quite long. 

So, a bit of backstory. My sister (14) has always been a good kid, until she started hanging out with the wrong group of friends sometime around the end of her 7th grade year or the beginning of her 8th grade year. It’s gotten worse and worse. Calling people slurs, bad behavior in class, detention, causing drama, etc. It’s hurt to watch her change so much, especially when I know there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it. 

    In late March I believe, (the exact date doesn’t really matter, it was just fairly recent), she was caught smoking weed in our backyard by our mom. She was yelled and and had her phone taken for a day or two if I remember correctly. Getting caught didn’t seem to phase her at all. She thought it was funny. Still, I hoped that this would maybe steer in the right direction and she would get her behavior on track. 

   Nope. Two weeks ago, she snuck out at 4 AM while everyone in the house was asleep. She got a ride into town by a 16-17 year old boy that we know nothing about besides his first name. Apparently, she was sneaking out to meet up with her boyfriend who lives out of town. She called our stepmom to come pick her up, our stepmom then told our dad, who then texted our mom. I didn’t see how my mom confronted my sister, as I was in the shower. I got out because I heard yelling and asked my twin sister (TS for simplicity) what happened. “Oh, you didn’t know?” TS explained to me what our younger sister did and that now she was in trouble. We were both pissed and very glad she had got caught. My sister’s punishment was light. Her phone was taken away for around five days. 

   On Tuesday of the next week, the three of us (me, TS, and younger sister) left to go to our dads house (parents are divorced if you hadn’t figured by now.) My dad grounded my sister and told her she would not be allowed to use her phone while she was at his house. My sister lied to my dad and told him that our mom still had her phone and that she hadn’t taken it over. Of course, she was caught later on. My dad was angry and told her that my mom has to come and pick it up, as she was grounded. My sister told him that my mom was going to come pick it up the next day. The next day rolls around and my sister says that the phone is gone. I don’t have exact details on this because I didn’t want to get involved with her whatsoever. But I guess my mom has not actually taken my sister’s phone back and only said she did so that she could continue using it. 

   Here is where I need advice. Last night, I was sitting in our living room watching tv. My dad and stepmom had gone to bed and my sisters and I were the only ones up. My younger sister comes out of our room and tells me she is going out back to talk on the phone with one of her friends. I had a bad feeling and I should’ve listened to it. My sister went outside and I forgot she was even out there for a bit. There is a window in our living room that looks out into our backyard, it was open. I smelled cigarette smoke (you can see where this is going.) At first I thought it might have just been from being around my dad, who is a smoker. But, based off of my sister’s track record, I figured it was her. I was furious. I walked out back and found her smoking one of our dads cigarettes. I didn’t know what else to do. I yelled at her while she cried and gave excuse after excuse. She told me how sorry she was and that she was going to stop. I know that was bullshit because I heard that same speech given to my mom when she was caught smoking weed. 

   I honestly don’t know what to do. My sister said that she would tell my parents that I had sex with my s/o (which she has no proof of) if I told my parents that I caught her. To be truthful, I feel like I would get in more trouble than my sister if our parents found out. I’m just so angry and upset and disappointed in her. I don’t know what’s right. I don’t want her getting herself hurt. I’m hoping I can get advice from someone here. I apologize for the long post, but I figured the backstory was necessary."
"My boyfriend constantly jokes about porn. I understand it sounds petty. I just wanted another perspective on this, other than my own. 

My boyfriend constantly jokes about watching porn and thinks it is hilarious. He has a brother that is 10 years younger than him (just turned 13) and they have the same humor about it. My boyfriend is 24, and I told him you do realize you have the same humor as a middle schooler. He justifies it as his brother got it from him. Which I responded with how distasteful that was and unattractive, that he had his brother joking about porn at 11 years old. 

I’ve told my boyfriend I get it if you watch it, I know it’s a thing, I just don’t want to know about it. 

But when I told him how unattractive his jokes are and distasteful, he told me “Well I’m not going to change myself for anyone.” I told him I wasn’t asking him too, I was just disappointed in the immaturity of it. And I’m honestly not going to ask him to change himself. What I want to tell him is, good luck finding an adult relationship with a girlfriend who will find your 13 year old humor funny. I’m also not saying he can’t joke and have fun with his brother. I just, again, am disappointed in the immaturity. 

Am I overreacting? Should I tell him most girls won’t find that funny. Or do they? Am I just lame? And if so, perhaps we aren’t as good of a match as I thought. 

I’m not telling him to change, but I just thought a man in his mid twenties would be a little more mature about it."
"Moved in with boyfriend and his friends/roommates of 10 years Recently my relationship with my boyfriend and his roommates has become strained. I've lived in the residence 5 months paying an equal amount of rent. However, I tend to be dismissed during roommate discussions or issues. I've discussed this with my boyfriend, however he is typically tired from working 50+ hrs a week and gives me an irrelevant answer to the concerns I have.  The recent concern has been the older female roommate having her latest love interest over 3+ days a week (6 total in a 3 week period) unannounced). I'm uncomfortable with this and it is excessive, impacting me the most because I have to work from home. When he talks to the longterm roommate in question, she dismisses it and says he is only saying it because I have a problem with it. My issue is that 1) the roommate doesn't treat me like an equal paying roommate and my boyfriend doesnt confront in the situation,  and 2) that this is an ongoing theme. I express concerns when they arise (roommate issues, just having time together,  etc). They're often dismissed or turn into an event where he cries and opts to leave the discussion. I just don't know what to do anymore. The previous boiling point occurred when I lost it and went off the grid for 2 hrs, resulting in him finally bringing the main issue up with the roommate but giving her a ""heads up""and a disclaimer stating ""you didnt hear it from me"". I understand working so much is a factor, but there has to be some backing up on his end as well. I think I'll opt for a hotel for a few nights to get my head straight and be calm. Anyone have experience with a similar situation?

TL:DR: bf who has long term roommates that I now live with (10+ years over states) doesnt back me up in roommate issues that I should have a say in when I pay an equal amount of rent; bf does not separate me as a paying roommate or legitimalize my concerns in discussion. When he does, he chooses to give the roommate a ""heads up"" that I have a concern but separates himself from it (""you didnt hear it from me"")."
"What should I do?? Bf advice ! Me and my boyfriend have been in a long distance online relationship for a year. We took a break for a couple months bc I needed time off for school. But we got back together, and I noticed his followings, they were mainly really pretty models and porn stars. And beforehand he never followed anyone like that. Even really attractive locals. I’m a VERY insecure person. And it made me really jealous, irritated to see that. And ofcourse I brought it up eventually bc it kept eating me up as I tried to ignore it as completely normal. And thennn he told me he followed them to make me jealous when we weren’t together. I thought It was scummy, but I think he was lying as an excuse to just look at them. Plus if it was true, wouldn’t he unfollow them by now since we’re together? I know it’s stupid and most people would think I need to work on my insecurities but it’s just kind of a whole respectful kind of thing for me. I never do that sort of act, I never get attracted like that and follow males. It could be just me, but I do it bc I’m really in love with him. It scares me tho, my last relationship he followed models etc. and he kind of expected that sort of perfection from me which made me feel this way. I’m just very insecure in general. He does tell me he loves me and he’s only attracted to me but I think it’s kind of weird and dishonest since he’s following them? Idkkkkk, I feel bad bc I don’t wanna be controlling but it’s eating me and I love him, I’m scared to keep bringing it up as annoying. I just don’t think it’s okay to follow sexual accounts in a relationship. Even if it’s long distance.. I’m a fucking dumbass :("
"I may just be drunk at 3am, but am I in love with my best friend??? Okay so I’ve known this guy for like 2 years, and we’ve been so close since we met. He’s literally the male version of me. Same taste in music, films and art. I just got off the phone with him and I just started thinking while listening to the Modern Lovers like... damn. 

I did just break up with my ex so like also maybe I’m just spiralling? Maybe lockdown is just getting to me? Idk. 

The thing is like I’m not attracted to him, but like personality and character wise we’re like the perfect match. And I know like opposites attract and whatever but my ex was the opposite to me and like that did not work for me. 

I’ve never like considered a relationship with him before so it may just be because I’m 6 beers in but also??? 
Also thank f*** for auto correct (idk if you can swear on here, please enlighten me). 

Also like 6months ago he did say that he loved me more than a friend when he was drunk, but then when we talked about and he said he didn’t and I believed him. 

I’m p confused.

Another hinderance (ooo boujie word for a drunkard damn Im impressed myself) is that we now live like 400 miles apart but honestly like even so our friendship has like not been hurt from the distance so would it if we were in a relationship?

Also Don’t Marry Her by the Modern Lovers is such a jam"
"I (F40) caught my son (M14) masturbating yesterday and I realised that he watches porn and masturbates too much (multiple times a day). ThrowRA account. I (F40) caught my son (M14) masturbating yesterday. We both live in a small 1.5 bedroom house (1 bedroom and 1 small room which my son uses as his own room), and we have only 1 bathroom in our house, which means that both I and my son share the same bathroom. Yesterday morning, I was cooking in the kitchen and my son was in his room studying. From the kitchen, I saw him enter the bathroom with his tablet and earphones, but I didn't think much of it. I brought him that tablet exclusively for his studies, but he also watched a few YouTube videos on it. He usually showers in the evenings, so I thought that he was going to use the bathroom only for a while. After around 20 minutes, I wanted to use the bathroom. Thinking that my son has finished using the bathroom and is now in his room studying, I didn't knock the door and I just entered. There I saw my son sitting on the toilet with his tablet in his left hand connected to earphones, and he was vigorously masturbating with his right hand. He was enjoying it so much that he didn't even realise that I had entered the room. 

I didn't want to shock him, so I silently shut the door and came back to the kitchen. I couldn't take in what I saw. I wanted to unsee what I had seen just now. After a while, I saw him coming out of the bathroom with a smile on his face and I wasn't really happy about it. But I thought about it for a while and I thought that maybe it isn't that much big of a deal and I should just forget it.

Later that night, I was very curious. I had brought him that tablet for his studies, I didn't expect him to use it that way, so I thought of checking out the tablet and looking for his search history to see what he was viewing. I sat him down on the dining table and gave him dinner and while he was eating, I thought of going and checking his tablet. I opened chrome history and I saw that he had deleted all history till that day, so I could only see that day's (yesterday's) history. I saw that he had opened pornhub 5 times already. He had opened pornhub 5 different times throughout the day! Now I really don't know if he masturbated each time he opened porn, but I'll just guess that he did. I also saw that he had opened another website called lovetreats and he had searched for ""male masturbators"" and ""fleshlights"". I later googled it on my phone and it was a toy that was used by men for masturbation and it was super expensive. 

It's actually really good that I got to know about this right now because we really can't afford those expensive toys and now I can take measures so that he doesn't use my credit card to buy things that aren't really necessary.

I was distraught after seeing his search history. I didn't know what to think. I thought that I probably failed as a mother. Now I'm not anti-porn or anti-masturbation or anything like that. I know that masturbation is healthy as I've done it before. Definitely not at his age, but I probably started masturbating when I was 19 or 20, plus, we didn't have easy access to porn at that time, so it was just me using my imagination and my hands to satisfy myself only once a week or two. If he does it that way now, I'm totally fine with it, but watching porn and masturbating 5 times a day with masturbator toys... Is it really healthy? I'm definitely sure that it's not healthy. 

The boy doesn't have a father, which means that I should be the one teaching him all that now. Any suggestions as to how I can handle this situation would mean a lot to me. Thank you

Tl:dr - I caught my son masturbating yesterday and I searched his internet history and found that he had opened porn websites multiple times throughout the day. I'm would love some advice and suggestions as to how I can handle this situation. 

No DMs please.

I've recieved some good advice! Thank you very much reddit!"
"Mother disapproves of my relationship?? I’m in a serious relationship with a guy who is only a year older than me. We love and trust each other and have about a year together. To continue together as a couple, I would have to move away because he lives in another country. We make each other so happy and trust each other a lot. I have looked into universities in Mexico (we are both Mexican but I live in the US) and we have both discussed me going there a lot. The plan for me is to live there with him and study there so we can be together. My mother is aware of our relationship and has an idea that I might want to go, and every time it has been mentioned she voiced concern about it. She says she doesn’t know him well and that monetarily it would be difficult. She says I can do what I want, but she won’t help out. After a lot of research and math, we figured out that with both of us working I’d be able to go there and arrive safely and we could start off from there. We live comfortably here, but unfortunately my boyfriend is not as fortunate. They have food and all the needed things in their house but it would be a noticeable living-style change. My mother has voiced concerns that I wouldn’t be comfortable in that situation either. Can someone offer their opinion? I’m certain it wouldn’t bother me. He lives happily but also admits to not having much money. I truly just want to be with him and be at his side. 

Also, should I work on leaving to be with him independently? Or, should I try and sit down and have a conversation with my mother and him and explain all of intentions to be together there? Any advice??"
"My girlfriend talks to a lot of guys on snapchat including guys she has been with in the past. My (18M) girlfriend (18F) and I have been together for 1.5 years.  Im not sure if im just paranoid, but a few nights ago i was playing clash royal on her phone while she was sleeping  since mine was dead and charging, and got a snapchat notification, I went on her snapchat and saw that she has streaks with multiple guys and has half her best friends list as random guys from our school and some idk from where. I know for a fact that she has had relationships/talked to atleast 2 of the guys she was talking to, and one of the messages from one of the guys(she had not opened it yet) said “you are just so pretty, I cant even handle it” and it wasnt the first message in their convo since it had the little emoji saying that they had been talking for a while next to his name. This makes me very uncomfortable and im not sure what to do. 

- Another thing, one time when we were together on my bed, she was acting a bit strange and angling her body/phone away from me while she was texting someone. I found out that this was a guy that she had slept with in the past and confronted her about it and she blocked him on snapchat. But a few days ago, he messaged her on instagram saying “do you still have a boyfriend” and she replied “yes” and that we have a good relationship. 

So with that reply it confuses me since the snapchat dms point in one direction whereas that convo she had points that she is loyal. 

Either way i feel like its really disrespectful to me that she talks to so many guys when I dont talk to any other girls, since I dont want her to ever feel paranoid like im feeing now. 

Can anyone please give their input into the situation , am i overthinking things, or do you think she is being disloyal."
"Does anyone here, also feel this urge for your girlfriend to acknowledge that she loves you every now and then? During this tough times of quarantine, I just feel that my girlfriend is distancing from me and not appreciating me enough for how much I love her. She says she forgot about how we were before and can't seem to remember. She thinks that we are not the same. But at times she does express that she misses me, but very rarely. But whenever she does, it relaxes me and makes me so happy."
"Feel like I'm fighting my girlfriends family Hi all, I've 20m been with my gf 18f for 2 years and I've never felt very welcome at my girlfriends mothers (where she lives). Weve been isolated together due to her not liking  the yelling and shouting that seems constant at her house.

Now onto the main bit, we've been at home together barring trips to the super market for my extremely sick mother that is staying with my sister with her new born baby, this is very important. As you can imagine, safety is on my mind at all times during now but others are a lot more lax about them, when dropping food off for my mum they disinfect everything we buy and we sit at the 1 end of the garden with them at the other. During this time we haven't been to my gf's mums house, today she got flowers for her mum and some toys for little nephew.

When we got there I reiterated that she has to stay away essentially, my gf said that her mother would want to hug her and she 'cant say no to her mum', she wouldn't elaborate further. So I said if she did try to hug  her I'd say no for her. Well that's what exactly happened, her mum held her arms out, I said I she couldn't and she replied 'I'm having one' or something to that effect and she starting going in for a hug and I pulled my gf away because she wasnt going to stop her or move. Her mum start telling at me and storms off, also calling me a prick on the way down aswell adding that 'I'm.not allowed in that house ever again'. I know I'm in the right and I wont be apologising to her mother.

My question is how does this bode for the future with my girlfriend? In honesty I dont really care nor mind not going back to her mums house but how will this play out in the future as I dont think there will be a resolution to this anytime soon."
I love my girlfriend but i think she's having an emotional effect on me. I try to help her in many ways and it can be hard some times
"Covid19 is breaking my relationship or opening my eyes? Since the start of the lockdown in the UK my boyfriend for over 1 and half years has decided to leave me home alone and self isolate at his parents house. I have told him that I was unhappy of his decision and that it was sad for me to be home all alone and for him to leave, but he didn’t care as he said to me that this is a “special occasion” a one in life time chance that he will get to spend a long time with his parents. He left 2 weeks before Christmas and sieve over 2 weeks at his parents house and left me alone over Easter. He then got back home to spend a week with me and departed again back to his parents because he wanted to Spend his 31st birthday at home with his mum and dad. It has been 2 weeks and he still at his parents house. We argue constantly about his behaviour but he likes to describe me as a big monster, who wants to separate him from his parents. The problem is that this is not the first time he behaves like this. He is always happy to leave me and run to his parents in fact he didn’t spend Christmas with me or any other festivity as his family is his priority. He keeps on telling me that he loves that he wants to marry me and  that I’m his number one, but he’s always ready to Ditch me and run back to his mum. I feel like he doesn’t care about me and that I am only good to keep him company whenever his mum is not there for him.  Every single time he then disappoints me he always come back with some present to apologise. I hate this behaviour as I feel like he wants to buy me. He keeps on telling me that he will change that I to be patient and wait and eventually it might happen but that is not fair on me!!! 
Every single time I express my feelings and disappointment towards me he is quick on telling me to end it and move back to my house. He also suffers from serious anxiety and is constantly thinks that his parents will die soon maybe that’s why he has this obsession to always spend as much time as possible with his parents??!?!
He refuses to go and see a doctor about his anxiety and blames me for causing him stress.!
I’m starting to feel drained by this relationship I can’t sleep anymore I’m constantly unhappy and worried. I feel like I’m wasting my time with someone who will never change and always treat me as his second best. I feel like I can’t trust him, he has shown me that he is unreliable and capable to leave me on any occasion. I’m very upset and sad I don’t know what to do, my family doesn’t live here and I feel completely isolated!"
"Feeling lonely in my relationship I'm a 27f and my boyfriend is a 23m and we've been dating for 2 years now. We live together and we never have sex. Maybe once every other month--if that. He's otherwise a very kind person but I feel so trapped in my relationship. We've talked about this issue and he simply says that he doesn't really need sex to show me he loves me. He always promises that we'll ""be ok"" and that we'll ""have sex more"" and that day just never comes. I've stopped bringing the whole sex convo up since March and still no sex. I'm starting to associate sex with stress and tears so I've been definitely avoiding the topic altogether.

I really don't want to sound like some sex crazed person. I just don't know what to do. He comes from a broken family (abusive parents) and I've tried to be patient these past two years but oh my God...we sleep next to each other every night and I feel this deep sadness inside my soul that keeps me up at night. I'm tired of initiating intimacy just so he can say no, that he has a canker sore or that he's super tired. I'm worried that if I break up with him, he will go back to his abusive parent's house and that hurts because he really is a nice guy! Has anyone been in this situation? What do I do??? Am I being selfish for considering ending because of this?"
"Wanting children My husband(29M) and I(29F) have both said we wouldn't be having kids for the foreseeable future, however, recently I've felt this terrible urge for many reasons. It hit me that not only will I be turning 30 next year but that my dear old dad (77M) won't be around forever, and the one thing I would dearly wish to give him is a grandchild. I'm so torn because I know it would impact my husbands mental health. Quite frankly I don't even know how to broach the subject of children with him at all. How did couples on here approach the subject?"
"I feel sick with worry...  I'm not very good at dealing with emotional things to be honest and I'm in quite a dark place. I know I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion but this is my last stop for help I'm at my wits end.

 I'm a married man. Got married pretty quickly after meeting, to be honest there was never a great physicality to it, but I cared for her deeply. We've been married now for 9 years in total. For the last 3 years there has been no physical relationship at all, not even kissing. I have been just keeping quiet for a few years but yesterday I snapped and asked if she even found me attractive, she said she does not.

 This alone would be bad enough but like a 2am infomercial... Wait there's more!

 So over the last week or so I've realised that I'm utterly infatuated with one of my friends. This makes me think if I can feel that for someone else then I don't love my wife.

 Maybe this is all a midlife crisis! I just can't even think straight right now. BTW I'm not expecting anything to happen with this other girl even if I ended my marriage. She is waaaaay out of my league anyway, I'm just besotted with her. I don't think I could risk telling her in case she no longer wanted to be my friend.

 So ummm, there you go. It's currently 3am and I can't sleep (getting about 2-3 hours on a night). I spend all my time worrying about this and what I'm going to do. If we broke up I'd struggle to find somewhere to live, we have a pet together, it'd be a nightmare."
"I [25F] feel like I need therapy because of my relationship So my boyfriend [36M] and I have been dating for going on 6 years. Just for a little background, I'm black and he's Asian (May be important moving onwards). We met at work, got along great, and soon starter dating. I want to say this was around the time a large amount of shootings took place against unarmed black males. It was like these stories were coming out almost monthly. It hit close to home since I'm black and have black male family members. I would often talk about it hoping to strike up a conversation but he would always suggest there's more to the story or have the general demeanor that he couldn't care less. He also said my ""people"" should just get over it and slavery. He even once mentioned that he worked in retail prior to meeting me and seeing the amount of theft by black people was making him racist, so he left. I believe he was racist before that. He would make comments regarding my lips being big or my hair. He made a joke once asking if I wanted to buy his hair. I was invited to a party and he joked that there would be fried chicken and grape ""drank"".  To make matters worse, I guess, his ex was white. And so when he broke up with me he started chatting with her and telling her about our relationship like I was crazy. I wasn't perfect I must admit but nothing crazy. 



About a year and a half later. I met this new guy who was probably a solid 8-9 out of 10 (at the time) and this guy was crazy about me, come to find out he was a cheater and had a live in gf. 
Anyway my bf (ex at the time) found out and got pissed off. Asked if I was sleeping with the guy, to which I was honest and said yes. This cued him to want me back, badly. I'm still not sure why but I went with it and got back together with him. However this time he's different. He hasn't said anything racist, he seems nice enough but I still struggle with the past. I feel like I can't let it go and I just look at him differently. The race stuff isn't the only thing that I feel I can't get over. He also hardly ever compliments me. In fact he does the opposite sometimes and I feel like he doesn't even notice. He insinuated I wasn't as smart as I need to be to pursue a certain field. (I was in gifted and advanced classes in school but dropped out at 16). I have brown eyes but I do get compliments on them I guess because the shape? Anyway I always had low self esteem so compliments make me feel confident. This particular time I was complimented on my eyes and so I told him about it and how good it made me feel but he said they were average and poop colored but that's okay because so are his eyes.... idk. 





I feel like this man spent over a year destroying my self esteem,  self worth, and made me feel crazy. And now he's different but I can't let it go. He's been better these past few years but I'm having a hard time feeling secure and wanted. Not to mention we hardly have sex. Granted we don't live together but that hasn't stopped anyone. Last time was around Christmas. I'd feel like an asshole breaking up with him now because technically he hasn't done anything wrong. And more often then not I feel like I actually have an attitude with him. He called me out on it once and said I'm always negative towards him and I feel terrible but I feel unable to let it go. I want to go to couples counseling but he insist he has no issues. I'm not sure what to do.


Tl:dr my boyfriend was terrible the first few years we dated (so was I possibly), we broke up for a year and a half and now hes different but I feel like I'm still holding a grudge. Idk what to do."
"My (M 22) Best friend (F 23) is been sending me nudes Ever since I told my best friend that I have a girlfriend (F 22), she’s been sending me pictures of her in panties and being provocative, with the excuse that she’s just showing off his cool ass... what does that mean? Does she wants something with me or just being cool?"
"Rebound relationship turned serious. Think of my ex every day. I (28M) came from a highly abusive relationship of five years. I then went straight into another relationship for three months, that didn’t work out and now I’m in another. It’s been just over a year. 
 
In my current one, I’ve fucked up so many times. I wish I could go into details of what I’ve done but I don’t want to get ID’d.

The other girl, who was in between my current relationship and my abusive one contacted me a while back. We were messaging for a bit, I saw her once, nothing sexual. The other girl was asking me to go back to her, promising that I was the one for her. My girlfriend found out and there was a shitstorm, as you would expect. I was proved to be a liar and dishonest. It was embarrassing and I felt slimy. She is still working on forgiving me. The other girl told me she never wanted anything to with me again. Understandable...

I can’t stop thinking of the other girl. I think of her all the time. I feel bad that we didn’t ever give it a shot. I feel bad that I even feel like this. It’s unhealthy. I know that my current girlfriend deserves better. Even if there is no way now that I’d ever get near the other girl, I’m having those ‘what if’ thoughts. When I met the other girl, my last relationship was dead - I’d not loved anybody (except my daughter) for years. I had this feeling. And when she told me it wasn’t going to work out right now because of issues we both had, but maybe in the future, I was hasty and moved on. But I met someone and she is lovely. 

I don’t want to hurt anybody anymore and I need to make sense of my obsession with this other girl. Somebody has suggested to me that infatuation and idealisation can really take over but I don’t know if it’s more than that. It’s been almost a year. 

What should I do?"
"Struggling to get over a recent breakup. Feel lost and empty My girlfriend (26F) ended our 3 year relationship with me (30M) about 6 weeks ago, right before the lockdown started. It wasn't an ordinary relationship. We had been through a lot. We moved in together after only 6 months (which was maybe too soon). We met in Canada and after 12 months we moved to the UK together. I'm British and she's Canadian British. 

We had been going through a rough time for a few weeks. She told me she wanted us to break up a couple of weeks before that but I was heartbroken and begged for us to work on things. Looking back now, I don't think she ever wanted to. Those few weeks were strange, mostly because the virus was just kicking in and we couldn't go out and spend quality time together to work on our relationship.

As the weeks past, we began to bicker, and she was being quite mean and snappy with me (not like her)  and she asked me for some space again, so I decided to go home to my parents (couple of hours away). We agreed that  I would go back home for a couple of weeks and she said she didn't want to talk for a week to get space, although we did briefly text through the week. She did also text me in that week and told me she loved me and missed me. A few days later (now 6 weeks ago), she called me and said she wanted to end things and that was it, final. How can you say you love and miss someone and end it 4 days later, and be so sure? Her reason was that she loved me but isn’t in love with me anymore. 

I was heartbroken. I sobbed for 4 days straight. I did all the things I shouldn't do, I texted her begging for us to work on things, told her I could be a better person and a better partner. That I would do anything to have her back. That I loved her more than anything. None of this got through. It upset me because she seemed so cold and distant. I can't tell you how much of an opposite this is for her. If anything, she is usually the more loving person who was better at showing her feelings than i was . I truly believed she gave 100% to our relationship and that she really loved me, which is why i still find it so hard to understand now. 

I started watching YouTube videos on breakups and I learnt about the no contact rule. So after 3 days of me begging I decided to stop texting. I did the no contact rule for a week or two. She would occasionally message me about the apartment and I would respond but nothing like what I had been. By the third week, I decided to post her a letter I had written. I summarised all my feelings into this long letter that I thought would be better to send rather than being tempted to text again. That letter had everything I could possibly say, all my feelings, all my love, my heartache. Everything. She told me she got it and read it but passed no comment.

Fast forward a few weeks, I was starting to feel a bit better. And by that I mean, I'm not crying everyday. But yesterday came the real kick in the teeth. I drove down to get most of my clothes back. I wasn't expecting it to upset me, we had been arranging it for a week and I thought I was fine. But that all changed when i saw her. She seemed really cold, like a different person. It was as if I didn't mean anything to her anymore. She helped me pack my suitcase and gave me a hug. I cried but she showed no emotion. I just can't understand it. I asked her if she regretted the breakup or was having second thoughts. Her response cut me so deep. She said, ""honestly, this is the first breakup I have had that I do not have any doubts over"" . 

I drove back home with all my stuff in boxes. Got to my parents house and just broke down. I feel exactly like I did on day one. I tried to unpack my clothes and just sobbed. It's not only losing her, but I think it hit me, I no longer have a home or anywhere to live properly. Everything I knew and had has been lost. Feel like I have absolutely nothing and the boxes made it real. I'm working from home from my parents during the virus, but I know at some point I'm then going to have to find a new place, alone. I moved to London with her. I don't know anyone else there and I don't have friends there that I can even socialise with once this is over. I don’t know if in even want to be there anymore. I feel so messed up. 

I honestly can't put into words how upset I am again. I didn't think it was possible to feel this much pain. (I have been through grief before, broke up with exes, lost loved ones) but this feels different. Maybe because I thought she was the one. I just continually beat myself up. I blame myself for the relationship ending. She was always 100% commited and I feel at times I didn't appreciate her enough, didn't do enough things to show her I cared and took her for granted. I think I thought she would always be there. I told her in my letter that I know all my faults and I would work on them, I could be a better partner. I listed everything I felt I had done wrong and how I could make it right, if she just gave me a chance. I said that knowing my faults is half the battle and I acknowledge them. 

After I got home yesterday I texted her again, saying how sad I was and that I wanted things to work out. She said she's sorry and thinks it would be best to block me on social media. She said she’s not interested in making it work anymore.

I'm heartbroken and i don't know how I can move on. I don't want to move on. If she loved me, and I am willing to change and work on myself how can she completely reject me. Did she ever love me as much as I thought? I think the hardest part is that there were not any real warning signs up until the last few weeks, if there were I could have prepared for it, or done something to change. It went from all to nothing so quickly. Is that normal? 

Sorry that was a long post."
"Should I wish her happy birthday Me (M19) and my girlfriend (19) broke up and have had no contact for three weeks. She’s the one who broke it up because she said she needs to figure out what she’s doing and she just saw me as a friend, we were together for 2 years and she had a or two like that but it always ended up just being stress or not being able to see eachother for a few weeks because of school. I have a feeling she might reconsider later but I don’t know. Her birthday is tomorrow and I don’t know if I should say happy birthday. I feel like if I don’t then she will get hurt but not say anything about it because she’s self conscious herself and probably assumes I don’t care for her anymore but I do. But I also feel like she just might ignore it. What are your thoughts?"
"My (15M) girlfriend (17F) just broke up with me a second time. She was my first love, advice to stop the heaviness in my chest? We met in my freshman year, while she was in her junior. Our relationship really only started to pick up in 2019, and we declared our relationship that year too. She's the type of girl to spend money everyday after school, acts a lot in the drama program and doesn't care too much about grades. I almost never go to hang out with friends, straight 90+ student and would rather not meet new people.  Anyways we do generic stuff on dates like walk around, get food, make out in private but never sex. We were both each other's first relationships.  


She breaks up with me March 10th over text, saying that I wasn't for her and that we need to move on. After thinking about everything that I did wrong and searching for answers within myself, I cry in bed, play some games, eat unhealthy food. (Big thanks to these posts for giving me advice). BUT, she posts a story with nothing but a frowny face, and I ignore everything this subreddit taught me and I respond. We get back together after 3 days, and we're even better than ever.

Fast forwards to May 7th 2020. I say that I miss her (COVID really hitting us hard) and that I want to call tomorrow. We call on the 8th (as of writing) and she opens by looking at the floor, and saying that she wants to break up. Wow I've seen this before. I've grown since then, and I don't look for answers. I instead call her out, saying that I can't do anything, and that it's because she only agreed to be in a relationship because she wanted male attention. She hangs up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, without her for the second time, I'm thinking deeply again. I've already told my feelings to a trusted friend and he told me to recognize that I'm just as real as she is, and our relationship was 50-50 and not a power imbalance. I'm about to distract myself with League of Legends, but the weight stays, knowing that I will probably never let her back in

What's the next move? (Sorry for formatting, first post ever)"
"Would like to try a threesome at some point  Hi all,

I \[M25\] would love to do a threesome with my girlfriend \[F23\] and another male (or female). And eventually (after some years) maybe even a gangbang. We talked about it, but she thinks its nicer to do it just with me.  
How can I convince her to try it out at some point? Anyone experience with convincing their partner? Any help is welcome! A PM is also okay"
"(35f) My sister’s (32f) BF (30) asked her for an “open relationship."" She is 8 months pregnant with his daughter Just posted this on another subreddit but it was taken down as it concerned a relationship. So I hope this doesn’t get taken down.

I love my sister (Lianne) very much. We have a pretty close relationship in that she comes to me for advice whenever she’s worried, which I am more than happy to help her with. So when she called me crying at 2am last night it concerned me very much. At first I thought something awful had happened to her regarding her pregnancy (8 months). Then when she told me she had kicked BIL out, I thought it was him cheating on her or something like that. But no, it was something MUCH worse.

Apparently, BF has been acting a little “shady” and just not being himself lately (which she had told me about because she was concerned about him I told her it was probably him worried about the pregnancy). Well apparently, the reason is because he wants to open up the relationship (major scumbag move, especially as she’s SOOO close to giving birth).

I told her that it was a major red flag that he this is what he wants and he choose this time when the world has gone to shit and she is so vulnerable that anything can go wrong with her pregnancy that it was a total *dck* move and that she’s lucky he showed his true colors before they got married.

We spoke on the phone for about 2 hours until she calmed down and went to sleep. When I told my husband what had happened he agreed that he was an AH, but I shouldn’t involve myself in my sister’s business as she’s a grown women who can handle herself, and that there are some cultural differences between us and BF that we should let them work out the nuances of their relationship themsleves.

I don’t completely agree with him, but I can see where he is coming from. So I’m asking you RA, whats the best way to support my sister and protect her from this creep?

ETA: Thanks for all the feedback guys, I had a talk with my husband whose since apologised (he can be a little cold when he doesn't get his sleep and it's something we're working on). We have decided that my sister can move in with us until after she gets back on her own feet, and like many of you have suggested we have made an appointment with our aunt who is her OBGYN.

This will probably be my last post, unless you want updates or something big happens. Thanks again guys, I knew I can count on r/relationship_advice for some help."
"How do you get over someone you really care about. I'm at a loss here. I M(18) have known this girl F(18) nearly all my life and have had a crush on her for all of it. For the first few years it was a simple crush but around grade 6 it became more as I got to know her personally. She was very kind to me despite the fact that she obviously knew I had a crush on her for a long while and I was the weird fat kid in the class.

I switched schools around grade 9 and talked to her on and off since then. We still have rare conversations to this day but jesus christ no matter how hard I try, I cant get her out of my head. I've had differnt crushes over the years but it always returns to her. Sometimes I feel bad about it because i feel like I'm stalking or obsessed with her even tho I havent stalked her at all.

I talked with a friend about it and he said it makes sense given my history shes the first person in my life who genuinely cared about me and as I got to new her I saw all her good qualities. I read about how sometimes we are enchanted by others because we see only their surface but thats what makes this so hard because I really got to know her and her faults and I'm still head over heels for her.
What's worse is the entire class knew I liked her and she said ""it's okay if you have a crush on me"" as I laughed and awkwardly said no (I'm not a good liar okay).

So yeah bit of a haphazard post but anyway HELP. ME. PLEASE."
"Help with spouse who has PTSD Spouse just recently discovered they have PTSD. They are going to therapy and taking medications. We have been together for several years and we don’t have children. (Early 30s)

It seems like every time I turn around, something is a trigger for them. They tell me it’s not my fault, which I genuinely believe. But how do I not let it ruin my time? It impacts everything from dinner, to watching TV. 

I love them with all my heart. I know I’m not supposed to “fix” it, but love and compassion doesn’t seem to help either.  I just hope I can help them through the hard times. I just feel hopeless and I don’t want to make it worse by getting frustrated. Any help is appreciated."
"My twin is slowly killing herself and no one around me seems to care. I don't know what to do anymore. Our mother is practically useless, as she sees everything happening and doesn't do anything about it. It seems like she doesn't care. My twin (20f) doesn't really eat much anymore and is drastically losing weight. At the moment she's already 109lbs and wants to get to 100. This is not right for the height that she's at.  She has been having dizzy spells, nausea, and has turned into a completely different person (personality/mood-wise). I ask her why she's doing this to herself and she doesn't really give me an answer. I've called around some places for help but they all said I technically can't do anything for her because she's an adult and has to be a ""danger"" to herself. I'm losing my mind, it feels like she's literally dying in front of me and I can't do anything about it. I really can't live without her, she's my best friend. What can I do? I want to try to talk to her, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow I can get her to listen?? I admit so far it's been just me freaking out on her, which is probably not the best way to handle this, but  I'm having so much anxiety about this whole thing.

**tl;dr**: My twin has started drastically losing weight and nobody around me seems to care. What can I do for her?"
"My (28F) SO (29M) wants to do acid with a friend even though he knows I’m incredibly concerned about his wellbeing. He doesn’t like to “be told what to do”, and I want to give him his freedom - but this is a health concern for me, and makes me think about stability in the long run. He knows this is very stressful for me and still wants to go through with it. Am I overreacting? I’ve never done drugs in my life. We’ve been dating 1.5 years. Any advice welcome!"
"I (23F) feel that my friend (23F) only talks about herself and it's putting a toll on our friendship. I've known L for a couple of years now. Her and her husband are both friends of ours. When they moved across the country, my now-fiance and I helped them out. She's always been a bit difficult, but overall she's fun to hang out with. Not long after leaving, L got pregnant and they had an awesome baby boy.

We saw them again back in September when we went on a vacation together and L seemed different somehow? She had always been a bit self-focused, but it had gotten extreme. She has celiac disease and also couldnt have dairy at the time, so if we all wanted to go somewhere to eat she would be bitchy about it even when I did all the research for her via celiac forums for local restaurants. She did none of the research herself but complained about the lack of menu options each time. She was snippy with a waitress for giving her a paper straw without asking (apparently straws can have gluten?), she was rude to her husband for not going to bed the moment she went to bed, etc.  

Every time we talked about something that didn't have to do with her, she'd kind of wiggle her son around and say ""I made this!"" time after time after time. I love her son, but it did get a bit old- especially when we were trying to play board games! At the time I was starting a new job the week after that I was super nervous about, and while her husband asked about it, I didn't get more than a passing comment from L. She didn't really care.

Since then it's been long distance. I got engaged recently and aside from the initial ""I want to do your engagement photos!!"" all I've gotten are anecdotes about how she decided not to have a big wedding because it's a waste of money.. not a single question about how the planning is going or when it'll be. Her husband did the whole ""congratulations!!"" thing but not a peep out of her. When we moved and I mentioned getting a pet, she got preachy about what kind of dog to choose- no ""congrats! Where to?"" 

The most she's asked about me in months was a random text where she said she had a dream I was pregnant and asked if I was. I said haha I hope not! and she made a comment about how she'd ""make fun of me forever for getting pregnant out of wedlock""- which felt like a jab at me, since we're both religious.

And recently we got some kittens, which is super exciting to me since I've been waiting for years. I tried talking to her about it through the adoption process and got short responses so went back to asking about her son, which got me a tidal wave of baby talk. When we finally brought them home I tried sending her photos, only to get either memes she'd made for a show I've never seen or a selfie of her wearing a $1 makeup headband she's excited about. The most I've gotten is ""cute"" or ""babies!"". Or more often, left on read.

I feel a bit petty for being annoyed, but I just feel that I can't share my life with her. My fiance mentioned that she's always been insecure about failing community college and went from HS to being a stay at home dog mom, so that's probably why she avoids work talk, and I know she's mentioned not having a real wedding before, but I just wish our conversations didnt feel so one sided!"
"Redditors who were cheated on but decided to work things out with their partner, any insight? How do you know if it's worth it to try? I don't deserve to be hurt like this, and I know my self worth. But I know the man I married, I've seen his soul. He is deeply ashamed. I know he means it when he says he's going to change. He's going to see a psychiatrist starting next week. But I'm still terrified, because he has lost all my trust. We've had all the people in both of our lives talk to us, and he's told his friends what he did. They're all very shocked and disappointed at what he did, rightfully so of course. They all know me and care for me. My friends and family are hurting badly for me.

I know I must heal away from my husband in the safety of my loved ones first before making any decisions. But I would just like some insight. Is it possible to recover from something like this? Any advice? Thank you so much."
"im inviting a girl over(im a boy,14)  im inviting a girl over but i dont wanna make it kliché or weird n stuff. she is freaky(so she says) and yea any tips on how to make it not awkward, kliché and weird?"
"Weird housemate behaviour When I (24f) moved in to a house share with people I had never met before. I was excited to meet new people and experience living on my own for the first time!

During my first week, I noticed the 38 year old Bulgarian man who lives here, going into the garden early in the morning (not too weird maybe he was just getting some fresh morning air). Well once I saw him out there early and it looked like he was peeing! He had his back to the house but I could clearly see he was holding his penis. 

I went into the garden a couple of days later and noticed there was a patch of grass that just didnt grow there. This patch was exactly infront of where he stands. Ew super gross, he treats the garden like his personal morning toilet. I tried to make sense of it by thinking that maybe because its early he doesn't wanna wake everyone up by going to the toilet, as he lives on the ground floor... 

I always try to hop over the weird patch of no grass when going into the garden because I don't want to step in piss. 

Well today, I went into the garden about to hop over the no grass patch and there is a white liquidy semen-like looking thing exactly where I thought he was peeing. I'm so horrified!

He masturbates in the garden!?!?!?!!?!?!!!!!! 

What the hell!

I feel so uncomfortable. It's already weird being the only female sharing a house with 2 men (everyone else has moved out temporarily because of the virus) but this is just..... WHAT?!

Why not just wank in your room like everyone else?! 

I'm so creeped out. How disgusting!!!!! And to just leave it there for someone to step in as well. Ugh.

Why are people so disgusting?

What can I do about this? How do I bring up ""hey, you know I found your cum in the garden and I know it's yours because I have seen you there in the mornings before, please stop masturbating in the communal areas?!"" I DEFO DONT WANT THAT CONVERSATION!! WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO? 

GROSS!!!!!!!!!"
"Should I say anything I don't like my brother's girlfriend and I don't know if I should tell him or not. She is very selfish and fake but I don't know if he can see through her. My whole family doesn't like her either but no one has said anything.

I don't want this to come between our relationship and it's like I'm dictating his life. But I also don't want him to be miserable forever. What should I do?"
"I’m (21f) such a jealous person that it’s ruining my relationship with my bf (26m) My boyfriend and I live together. He got a second job delivering Chinese food. He once told me most girls that work there are “young and attractive” but he said “most males are programmed to be attracted to most girls”. It really got me upset and so hurt. In the past he has commented and checked out girls in front of me and I think that’s where all this jealously originated. 

Recently he keeps talking about how cool this one girl is and how he’s happy he got to see her once the company reopened.  He says her cooking is great (she brings in food sometimes) and he started comparing another persons cooking to hers. I looked her up in Facebook and she is 100% his type. I’m very upset and I feel insecure. I’m so jealous that I’m even considering breaking up with him because I can’t deal with feeling like this. 

Every time I try to tell him how I feel about it he gets defensive and calls me jealous. We even got into an argument because I didn’t trust him going to the Christmas party last year. 

Every time he goes to work I feel so scared he’s secretly with these girls. I just have a terrible gut feeling. I love him and my whole life revolves around him I don’t know what I can do to trust him since trust has been so broken from the start. I feel like I’m the crazy one and need help to fix my jealousy and insecurities"
"I compromise, he doesn’t How do I get him to compromise or show him that what he’s doing isn’t nearly enough? Here’s the background on it..

I (f/25) have been with my bf (m/22) for 4.5 years. About 1 year or so into the relationship I realized that we had opposing love languages. I need affection and touch and he likes his space and to do things for him. At first it was a really big deal bc I really needed to be loved that way and he wouldn’t budge. Basically what ended up happening is that I give him his space almost all the time and I try to never ask for any kind of affection bc it pisses him off, even when he’s in a good mood. I also get affection in forms that he deems acceptable like he won’t rub my back or lay with me, but he’ll sit on the couch and watch a 30min episode of something with me. Sometimes I’ll ask for a quick kiss and he’ll get pissed off. I try not to do it often, but that is my love language, I feel like I’m asking for 0.05% of what I actually need and he’s getting 99% of what he wants. I’ve compromised so much and I feel like he doesn’t show me love in my love language OR his.

Just right now we had dinner with his family and we came back home and we were talking (he was laying on the bed). I plopped down and said, “Okay, 10seconds please?” and he says no and is already annoyed. I say please and he’s like, “I DON’T WANT TO FUCKING CUDDLE.” and I tell him, “That’s not what I’m asking. I just want you to lay your hand on my head for 10 seconds.” That’s all I fucking wanted. Instead he smacks his hand on my forehead and I’m like, “Ow, not like that.” To which he replies, “I don’t fucking want to. What don’t you understand? It’s been this way for 4 fucking years. What don’t you get?!” Literally 10 FUCKING SECONDS, of basically nothing!!! I just needed him to rest his hand on my head. THATS ALL. And I told him, “I’ve compromised that whole time. I never ask for anything. It’s just 10seconds.” And the last time I asked for any kind of affection like that must’ve been at least 2-3 weeks ago. We live together and even in quarantine he stays in his room or separate from me almost all day. He doesn’t go to sleep at the same time as me so it’s not like we sleep together and get to cuddle or anything and even if we did go to bed at the same time he still wouldn’t. Like if he wants me to touch him and rub his back or play with his hair then it’s acceptable on his terms and I better fucking do it or he’s going to complain, but god forbid I ask for the same.

He never replied to my last comment about me compromising. I just laid there thinking how I had to beg for 10 fucking seconds and I didn’t even get THAT. Like always. Then he looks over and says, “Stop pouting. It’s fucking annoying. I’m not gonna fucking do it.”

What the fuck am I doing wrong or how can I get him to see my side of this?

When we’ve gotten into this before he’s said that he doesn’t fucking want to and he doesn’t like that all this other shit. He’s affection with our pets and his nieces and nephews. I feel like it’s just me.
Please help..."
"Is my autism over 9000 Recently i have been thinking, what is the point of being in a relationship? Obviously there are benefits to being in one, otherwise everyone would be just like me.

I [M29] used to be just like the average kid growing up. During elementary school days, from 5th grade i used to have girlfriends, quite a few actually. Used to change gfs nearly every couple of months if not less. Those days i used to enjoy talking to them for hours on end, raising up that phone bill and getting in trouble with my parents. Going to the movies, holding hands and on some occasions a little lip kiss.

Fast forward to middle and high school, relationships with girls lasted a few months before changing gfs. I didnt change gfs because of any relationship issues or arguments/fights. Its just that if another girl came around, and she was hotter and wanted to get with me, i would just stop calling the current gf and give the new one more attention. I didnt even like to tell the current one that we need to break up, i found someone else or that youre not attractive to me anymore, because i would feel so bad to break their heart. So i would just stop calling and avoid them in hopes that they would pick up on the hints and move on.

Fast forward again to college life and sex. Lots of sex with loads of random girls and by then i couldnt even be bothered to stay with one girl for more than a few days to a week at most. But i never played my gfs (you know, juggiling two, three on the side) or gave them false hope of being together forever, marriage or anything remotely close. Just went with the flow: if a hotter girl came around, i would avoid the current one and etc etc. Also i should mention, i never manipulated them for money, or made them pay for shit when we go out. Even the weed and booze i used to have with those girls, i would pay for the entire bill and would not ask them to contribute.

Recently i have been thinking, i cook my own food (my female companions seem to like it, so it cant be that bad); i clean my own apartment; when i get sick (fever, cold, food poisoning) i like to be alone. So other than sex, why the fuck would i need a female companion? Dont get me wrong, i wanna be just like everyone else and have a gf that i wouldve been going out with for, lets say, a year plus. Go christmas shopping together, go to each others' parents' house for holidays, and do all those other couplesy shit. But my brains keeps asking, what would be the point of that? I know society wants me to be like that, but if i make a decent living, have weed, booze and regular sex, why would i want to commit myself to one girl forever? How does that benefit me?
Some of you might come with, ""your future security"" bullshit, or ""who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone"" crap; but isnt that a bridge to be crossed much later on to be worrying about it now?

TL;DR not sure why i cant or dont wanna stay in a forever type relationship when, other than sex, i dont really need anything else from a girl. But the question is, is there something greater to be had from being with one person forever? If so, what is it?"
"Unsure of what to do Ive been dating my girlfriend for a year and a half now. In the beginning, everything was great. I loved having her with me, she gave me joy, my family adored her, and we had sex on a consistent basis. 

Fast forward and things are so much different. We now live together in an apartment because her parents move constantly and I wanted to give her a stable home instead of having a long distance relationship, I was warned that this was too soon by some of my friends and I didnt listen. The girl who once got upset when I didnt want to have sex sometimes now wants to be closer to God and wants to wait until marriage. Im not a sex maniac, but this isnt a lifestyle that I enjoy and I feel like I have to put up with it because I love her. Its been 4 months since we last had sex, and weve only had sex about 5 times since we got the apartment in November. She promises that once we get married, we can have sex endlessly and I honestly don’t believe her. Im only 23 and I feel that this pent up sexual frustration is affecting me, and I refuse to cheat. 

Theres also the problem with bills. At first, I was paying about 70%, because I had a better paying job. Now that Covid-19 has wiped jobs away, she has lost hers but refuses to file for unemployment, saying that God will provide the way. Im now stuck doing extra hours at a job I despise while she sleeps in all day peacefully. She gives me money here and there, but its not nearly enough to lessen the weight on my shoulders. We argue about it all the time, and says that im obsessed with money. Her family has also started talking smack about me and that they are even appalled that im asking for help with bills in the first place. This wasnt what we agreed upon when getting the apartment. I refuse to be late on bills, so I do side hustles on the side such as reselling popular items, and she gets upset that im constantly on my phone monitoring sites to get these items. She claims that im more worried about my phone then her, when all im trying to do is make sure that our total income doesnt 100% go to bills. 

She also tries to push marriage on me every single day, as well as moving to another state, claiming that once the lease is up she demands we move. My entire family and friends are here, whereas the state she wants to move in has neither mine nor her family. Last week she claimed she will go with or without me. 

I think im starting to lose feelings. Whenever we argue and she ignores me, I dont even try to make up half the time, even when I know im wrong. I sometimes find myself happy to sleep on the couch. Shes changed and no matter how many times we talk, I dont know if things will get better. Should I break things off or keep trying?"
"Cant get over him, no matter what I do. I'm not sure why I'm on here, seems like I have tried everything, so why would this work? But here it goes...
I (25F) was dating this amazing man (39M) 2 months ago. We had an electric relationship, full of so much passion, so much romance, so many things in common. He was so handsome, and the most interesting/amazing person I think I've ever met, plus the sex was AMAZING. We hit things off right away, and dated for about 4 months.

 And then we got in a big disagreement, because he wasnt being very considerate of my feelings about something, and he broke things off real quick. I still cant wrap my head around it completely considering how electric our relationship was, but from what my family has tried to help me understand, is that he just wasnt in it for the commitment, just the fun, and as soon as it wasnt fun anymore because of a disagreement, he bailed. And I've tried to make peace with that. 

But now it's been 2 months, and I feel like I have not made any progress on getting over him. I have tried everything, picking up new hobbies, throwing myself into my work more, read tons of articles/books on how to get over a breakup and move on with my life, trying to make lists as to why I SHOULD hate him, and even have tried dating a little. But I CANT GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD. I wish someone would just take a 2x4 to my head, and wipe out my memories of him. 

I think one of the scariest parts of all this, is that he has RUINED relationships for me. He was so damn amazing that I'm terrified I will never find another man as interesting/handsome/amazing at sex as he was. I'm terrified I will never have that electric feeling again. I've NEVER felt this way about anyone I've ever dated. 

But I know he doesn't want me back, he said I was ""too much work to be in a relationship with"", because I wanted to see him more than once or twice a week. He really likes his alone time, and I tried to respect that, especially in the beginning, but the more we dated, the more time I wanted to spend time with him, but he didnt feel the same way. So that's why he broke things off. 

I know I should be angry at him, and I try to be, and I try to think about how ridiculous it was that he didnt want to spend time with me, but hell, the times we did spend together were amazing. And I cant get over it. 

I dont know if anyone has real advice here, and so help me, dont say ""it takes time"". I'm so bloody tired of hearing that. I know it takes time, but it's been 2 GODDAMN months, and I still feel as sick to my stomach as the first day he left. I dont know what to do. Dammit, I hate being in love...😔"
"I’m so conflicted. Hi, I’m thinking of breaking up with my gf but I really don’t want to but I’m not happy. She keeps on ragging on me that I ignore her and always leave her on read. I never try to leave her on read and frankly I rarely ever do it, yet she does it all the time. Also I am very all over the place mentally and I forget she texts me all the time. This just makes me feel like she’s trying to criminalize me and make me a bad guy. I hate it and I tell her I’m trying to be better and she still says the same thing once a day. It all adds up and makes me feel like total shit.

Another reason I’m thinking about it is she doesn’t seem to try at all lately. We had a fight about a month and a half ago and I was very seriously considering breaking up with her and we came out okay. But it was all because I left her on read all the time and all the same stuff I said before, and I said I would try more and be better at that stuff; but I brought up my feelings as well. I told her that I don’t feel like she’s trying hard enough in this relationship to convey that she loves me. She’s had her moments when she’s shown her love but 80% of the time it just feels like I’m just some glorified friend. I am a person who needs physical affection and meaningful words of affection because I have large amounts of self doubt and I overthink all the time and I always assume people are trying to attack me. In result of this I can be very self inhibiting in the way I go about life but I also try to hold myself to an assertive standard. 

I have been feeling very neglected and I feel like I have been doing so much for her and I have gotten a fraction of it in return. I am feel so very burnt out and I just don’t want to have this kind of psychological link in the back of my mind all the time. I’m so done.

But I don’t want to leave her because she is so nice and pretty and all the things I could ask for. She has shown me she loves me but for the past 4ish months I haven’t been feeling it at all (we’ve been dating for about 1 year and a month). I am scared to leave her and say the things I want to say and I don’t know if I have the strength to do it. 

My mind has been a fog for the past month and I want it to be over."
"New guy I'm dating [40m] is extremely pushy/aggressive, I'm [29f] I met John\* (not his real name) on Bumble. He is uber successful, telling me that he was in South America for business (before Corona) and was VERY attentive and quick to text back.

Our first date I ended up drinking too much, so I don't remember the final parts of our date except that I stayed at his house. He said some odd, sexual comments. I'm a VERY open minded woman, but they just seemed weird coming from someone I barely knew. He said ""do you want to give you a special douche to clean you out,"" and he even texted it to me later when I was at home.

We had another date and when we left the bar he was extremely pushy. He pushed me against the wall (concrete) and aggressively made out with me. I said ""not in public"" but wtf, I didn't know how to react. Throughout our dinner he said ""Oh man, we would have beautiful babies, I can only imagine.""

It was time for me to get to my apartment so I leaned in to give him a goodnight hug. He pushed his way into my lobby and insisted walking me to the door. Once I got to the door, I had to use all my weight to lock the door against him he was trying so hard to come in. I said no plenty of times.

I woke up the next morning with a bruised (almost broken) foot.

I actually DID kind of like him... but I""m pretty intimidated. How do I gently break it off with him to not upset him?

\*\* throwaway obviously I don't want people to know who I am \*\*

tl;dr aggressive few dates with guy"
"My (21f) boyfriend (23m) thinks i lost my virginity to someone else (22m). I don’t think so. Please help. Hi everyone, (i have also posted this on r/relationships)

I’ve had a rough night filled with lots of tears and conversations and i don’t know what to do.

When i was 19, i “dated” a boy (20m at the time, 22m now. We don’t talk) for about six months. We were “exclusive,” but he never wanted to make it official with boyfriend/girlfriend terms. He was my first experiences for a lot, but i always knew i wanted to save my virginity for the first time i felt like i was in love. He knew this too. While we did sexual things, i never once gave my consent to go all the way. 

One day we were at his house, and we were fooling around. Things started to get a little bit carried away, and he ended up putting just the tip of his penis inside me. I told him no and freaked out, and he did pull out. It lasted no time, and i don’t consider it anything more than that. I did not have sex with him, nor did i lose my virginity to him.

About 6 months after i dated him, i started seeing my boyfriend. We are long distance, and we’ve been together for over a year now. I told him about my brief history, and that i was still a virgin. He was not. He lost virginity at a very young age, and feels as it and his other sexual experiences were huge mistakes. I did/do not really care that he wasn’t a virgin when we met. I don’t expect most people my age or older to be. It was a personal decision for me to wait until i truly felt ready and in love. I lost my virginity to him, and I’m happy with that decision. 

Well, a few weeks ago on video call, we talked about our histories. He asked me to list everything that’s ever been inside of me before. I listed a few things, but he asked me if the boy i used to date was ever inside me. I told him he already knows i was a virgin when we met, and not really and explained the above. He got really quiet and said “that still counts.” I explained my reasoning for why it doesn’t to me because i never said yes and it was hardly anything at all, and i thought that was the end of the conversation.

Fast forward to today on video call, we were talking about how one of my friends and her boyfriend are currently arguing over body counts and how silly it was when he let it slip that he now thinks my body count is two instead of one. This broke my heart because I’ve only ever had sex with him, and i waited for someone i loved, but he thinks i gave it up to someone who treated me poorly. I started to cry a lot, and we got into a bit of an argument about it. He says that “it still counts physically,” and i said “i didn’t give him my virginity. He can’t and didn’t take that from me. I gave it to you.” 

My boyfriend and i still were not on the same page as he could not get over the physical action. I continued to cry and said it wasn’t fair that i waited so long and was happy with my decision for it to be taken away from me for something i didn’t do or agree to. I said it’s not fair that he got to choose who he lost his virginity to, but that i didn’t. I was crying a lot at this point and went to go get water and collect my thoughts. 

When i came back to my laptop, my boyfriend was staring at the screen blankly and apologized while saying he now understands the “mental” and “emotional” perspective that i was trying to convey and that it’s not all “physical.” 

This still makes me feel disgusted with myself and the situation. I still do not even count it physically. I don’t count it at all. I don’t know how to make him see that. I don’t know if others even agree with me. I think i just need some outside perspective because this has been a really difficult conversation. 

Should i just consider it as losing my virginity? Should i try and look at it from a different perspective? Or should i just leave it at what my boyfriend is saying? I don’t know. 

Tl;dr: a boy i dated about two years ago was my first sexual experiences. We didn’t have actual sex, but it’s a point of contention for my boyfriend and i. I need help on how to navigate my feelings."
"Toxic/abusive sister Apologies if this seems kinda scattered, I'm pretty stressed at the moment, and it's hard to keep my thoughts focused even at the best of times.

So, I'm (26M) dealing with kind of a lot of crap, and I really don't know what to do. I live with my parents, my two adopted siblings, and my sister and her husband. (I know my parents are in their early/mid 50's, my sister is 27, her husband I wanna say is a year older, but idk, and my adopted siblings are 25ish and 27, both female) I got fired from my job back in March or April of 2016. I've been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, and a bunch of other mental health issues, on top of increasingly worsening problems with my shoulders/arms (and spreading to the rest of my body it feels like)

I can't work, and the past year or so I've been working on getting on disability, but in the meantime I've been getting food stamps and financial assistance so I can at least contribute a bit more again. My sister's husband is an uncaring, unsympathetic person. He does literally nothing around the house. My sister rarely does anything. Nobody does, really, until something has become a big enough problem that it can't be ignored anymore.

I'd been cleaning and such every day for the past couple years now. But I can't handle it anymore. I've told my parents, and I've tried communicating this to my sister as well, and she doesn't seem to care. She's basically demanding I do the dishes (the sink is currently full of dirty dishes, and the counter is also covered because they were doing some remodeling and shoved a bunch of crap in the kitchen so I couldn't do anything for three days) and clean all the towels in the bathroom and take care of the catboxes. There's eight cats I believe in the house, and only three boxes. Nobody scoops them at all, and then they complain the cats went to the bathroom on their bed or in their laundry basket or whatever.

I can't bend over without getting dizzy/light-headed. I can't handle large/heavy objects. I can't handle the smell from the cat boxes because they often go upwards of a month without being done. None of the cats are even mine. I got rid of my cat when we got kicked out of our apartment because I knew I couldn't take care of her. My sister got three more since we moved in.

I've also been basically the only one feeding the cats because I come out of my room, my sister has been home for hours but hasn't bothered to feed them, and they're all swarming me meowing and such. I do care about them for the most part, and they definitely deserve better. But a few hours ago I tried to tell my sister to feed them, she said ""well, you're right there, so you do it."" I was making food for myself, since I hadn't really eaten today, and I already had to put the dog outside (because we had to ALSO get a dog, though I love him even if he does get on my nerves sometimes) and I told her they're her cats and she needs to take care of them, and she told me I could leave. Only in a snottier, more rude manner because she always goes right to 11 when she decides she's gonna be be like that. I retorted with a line from family guy (""you can kiss the fattest part of my ass) mostly because they were talking about family guy before and it just popped into my head. So she said ""yeah, you can definitely get out. The sooner the better.""

This is at least the third time this month she's done something like this, and even though I've told her I'm working on getting disability (which I would assume implies I literally cannot work at this point) she's constantly telling me ""oh, Safeway is hiring"" or that I need to get a job, completely ignoring the fact that for the most part I'm constantly in pain and I don't have the energy to do a whole lot even when I'm feeling a bit better than normal. 

I only get $200 a month in food stamps and financial aid, there's no way I'd be able to move into my own place even if I could find one (I was talking to my counselor about it this afternoon) so I literally don't have any other options as far as living situation goes. but I'm tired of being forced to take care of six full grown adults because I don't have a job, I literally can't handle it, physically or mentally. And my sister is being incredibly abusive/aggressive to me, and I don't really know what to do. I feel like if I get kicked out, I'm probably just gonna kick the bucket. I'm already barely able to keep myself together as it is, I don't think I'd be able to take much more. 

My dad helps cover what I can't as far as bills go, since even with the $200 I get every month I'm still short. The house is technically my sister and her husband's, but the general understanding is that because none of us would have been able to afford to buy the house on our own, we essentially all had an equal share for the most part. (My parents had bad credit, or it likely would have been in their name I'd imagine) 

I don't really know what to do here. I already have enough issues talking to my family in the first place because of previous issues, this is making it even more difficult to really feel like I can trust anyone. It's not like I *want* to be disabled, it's not like I enjoy having the house a mess all the time (otherwise I wouldn't have done all the cleaning I've done up until now) I just can't handle it anymore. I'm trying to take it easy and focus on taking care of myself, and my sister is basically driving me towards being suicidal again. (If you missed it, I am seeing a counselor already, I'm working on that, I don't actively have any sort of plan or whatever. I'm just sick and tired of feeling sick and tired and being treated like garbage for it)

I'm honestly getting the same sort of vibes from my old job, where I got fired because I basically just got overworked to the point I had a mental breakdown and got sick and basically did nothing for a full week because I could hardly bring myself to get out of bed, as well as the same type of behavior from my ex friend I moved in with back in 2012 who told me I had to give them my food stamp card or I'd be kicked out (among a number of other fucked up things I'd rather not talk about at the moment...) I tried talking to my dad about this, but I didn't really get much help, and my adopted siblings really just seem like they couldn't care less about anyone else for the most part. 

I'm basically trapped in an incredibly toxic and abusive environment, and I don't have any really viable options to get out for the foreseeable future. I'd greatly appreciate any advice, or even just some basic sympathy since I really don't get much from my family lately."
"Am I in a Toxic Relationship? Just for your information this might be a long one..


So I’ve been in a relationship for just over 8 months, believe me when I say I adore this girl. I absolutely adore her. I (19M) always try to be there for her(18F) whenever she’s sad or not herself (she doesn’t appreciate her body and so sometimes she gets really sad just looking in the mirror but she’s absolutely perfect) I’ve always been there when she needs money financially. I’ve help with studying. Most things...

I guess I’ll get to the point. Around the 3rd month of the relationship I started to seriously question my sexuality, why? I have no idea. I couldn’t tell her.. lets just say she’s not the best with words and consulting or expressing yourself to her ALWAYS results in an argument of sorts(this is important). So I couldn’t tell her. So I decided I just wanted to find out and then tell her about everything that happened, before anyone scolds me, understand that I would never approach anyone sexually while in a relationship. Now that being said, I started talking to bi men and women alike. Just over texts. Getting their opinions and their reasoning and responses. While I do admit there were levels of flirting there was nothing serious to make it a red flag. I do not defend my actions in anyway but it was hard to talk to her and I just needed to know (I’m straight btw). Needless to say she found out, she saw it as cheating and rightfully so, she said it would be hard to trust me again and so I told her I’d win her trust back. That I wanted too. Fast forward a couple months later, I am friends with this female who likes me, she felt uncomfortable and I told her no problem I’d cut ties with her, so I blocked her or rather she made me block her on every social platform. To save you all reading an ear full. Lately things has been really rocky. Sometimes she goes on fits of hating herself, sometimes hating people. I always listen. Just to give you some context, sometime ago she had left to go out during quarantine and she had said she was on lockdown so we wouldn’t hang out but almost every day I swear she says she’s out with her friends till about 2am. She is currently “out with her friends”. It’s 11pm. But anyway. This day she had lied to her mum about where she was going. Didn’t text. Didn’t say where she was going. And her phone was off till practically she had gotten there, apparently she went to some nature trail with her friends. She says she forgot to tell me where she was going. And all I said was “anything could’ve happened to you and nobody would’ve know” and I shit you not she goes into berserk mode and goes on a fit about how she “isn’t allowed to forget”. (Also we have our locations on, important) Now in relation to this. I hang out with my friends one night we get pretty wasted, we exchange phones and a lot of messages are sent to different people. Naturally I didn’t even remember this happened. About two days later she doesn’t feel good. I had handed her my account passwords so she feels better about the whole trust stuff. She sees the messages. I explain what had happened. I even get my friend to apologize to her on FaceTime about it but she was visibly upset 

Now. Look at this. In the days after the even she went out to swim with her friends I said alright, I’d go hang out with my friends (planned to watch a movie) she got visibly upset over texts and then this entire argument broke out. I have never called her any name, never cursed at her, and no matter the situation or who is right or wrong I am always the one apologizing to her and consoling her. Now this particular night she cursed and insulted and downgraded me and yunno, all that good stuff lol. So I had decided that maybe I’d just end it right? Lol. Later that night after apologizing profusely for wanting to hang out with my friends while she literally did the same thing?? She started talking about suicide, hurting herself and all that nonsense. And at this point. I wasn’t going to say nothing anymore lol, so I comforted her the best way I could and she later relaxed a bit... I cannot explain to you the amount of times where we’ve had an argument it goes
Her- $%}&lt;%#~£¥%#~&gt;%}~€#}|, you’re just a liar and I’ve learnt that now
Me- I am sorry, I am honestly sorry I upset you etc etc
Her- whatever, your apology is fake. I think it’s fake. Whatever 
Me- I’m really sorry please don’t be upset
(Left on read)
(Several hours later)
Her- you’re going to leave me cause I’m a bitch, I hate myself, I’m not a very good girlfriend. I’m ugly. You’d leave sooner or later anyway 
Me- don’t say that I love you so much, I adore you
Her- if I just died no one would miss me anyway, you’d be happier 

And so on.. lol. I don’t know. This has happened countless of times. I can’t even begin to tell you how afraid I am of talking to my girlfriend, because I don’t know how she’ll react?? The worst part is she doesn’t read the entire ducking text lol. Just the first part. I shit you not, she never reads an entire paragraph or whatever. Just the first part and she doesn’t care about the rest. Now while part of me thinks I deserve this for not being able to talk to her some other part thinks I don’t deserve this. At the very least my girlfriend should listen right? Am I getting this wrong? Lol I honestly have no idea how American girls are. Anyway. Any and all advice on this topic would be appreciated tbh. Thank you for reading this long


TL; DR- (I don’t know how to do the stuff but I think this is what it is) I think my girlfriend might be toxic but she doesn’t let me leave the relationship"
"I (19F) met my boyfriend (30M) while studying abroad I just finished my second year of college and he just graduated. Last semester, we both studied abroad in a group of about 25 people. He revealed to us after the first week that he was 29, a non traditional student.

Throughout the next couple of weeks, I started hanging out with him more. We would go up to the roof with friends and smoke until it just dwindled to us two. Eventually, I would just ask him if he wanted to go up and we would spend hours talking.

Soon, we were playing footsie and holding hands and it felt really nice. We ended up kissing and he tried ignoring me the next day - he felt conflicted because of the age.

I kept pushing it. I'd see him more and more. Eventually we were just hooking up. We were in the same friend group and we just had a thing going on. It was fun and I liked being with him. We agreed to keep it casual. I had just gotten out of a long term relationship and he knew we didn't even live in the same state back home.

After two weeks of us hooking up and hanging out, we went on a week long vacation with our friends. We ended up sneaking away at night and I found myself developing feelings for him. I guess that's what happens when you enjoy spending time with the guy you're hooking up with.

He ended up going back to our country of study and I went on to travel more. Due to unexpected circumstances, my student visa had expired and I didn't know whether or not I could get back to our country of study. I was wildly upset - not only would I not be able to explore what we could've had, but I couldn't figure out my semester. During that time, I called him. He would talk to me and help calm me down. It was the first time I had traveled alone and I was terrified. 
Eventually, I came back to the country of study and had a lot of shit go down where I felt like I was alone. I had a few friends, but I was closest to him. Things got hard for us - it wasn't as easy to hook up and I was bullied.

One night, I got triggered while with him and we snuck down to talk. I was a mess and he just held me until I stopped. Even when I let go, he still held me tight. When I felt like shit, he was there to help me through it.

For our last month abroad, we ended up getting a job together in another city where we also lived together. We had separate bedrooms, but I spent every night with him and we fell asleep talking and he would wake me up with a kiss. 
It was a little difficult to work with him in the beginning - we kept getting on each other's nerves. But we always talked it through until we found our groove. 

Now, we're long distance (8 months now) and I'm happy with him. We've discussed a lot about the age gap and whether or not he was taking advantage of me. He had many a moral crisis about it, but I don't feel taken advantage of. He listens to me and he knows my boundaries - I'm also not afraid to share my boundaries.

Is there something inherently wrong about our age gap? What red flags should I look out for? Does him being 30 automatically mean that he's taking advantage of me since I'm only 19?"
"Should I Tell My Crush How I Feel? Okay so I have a slight dilemma with myself. I’ve had a crush on my guy friend who I’ve known since junior year (graduating high school RN). He’s funny and cute and he’s just such a great person to be around. I haven’t really said anything about me liking him but he and I did have a point where we fooled around during text and our friendship kinda got ruined because of it.

We were distant from each other until recently when we talked and it was good, but now I realized that my crush on him is overwhelming me. I don’t want to tell him because first of all he’s dating someone since freshmen year and I do not want to do anything to hurt them, and I don’t want to ruin my friendship with him.

Now we’re heading to college and I have a feeling we won’t stay connected. So now I’m asking myself, should I tell him and just let whatever happen happen? I might’ve already given off vibes but still. 

Help?? Please and thank you :0)"
"Husband [29M] cheated on me [29F] multiple times in the past. Should I leave? My husband has a history of sending sexually explicit messages to other girls. I first found out years ago, before we were married. At the time, I set a boundary that this was cheating to me and unacceptable. If he did it again, I would leave him.

I wanted to rebuild my trust in him and I was always afraid of what I'd find if I snooped anyway, so I tried to live in blissful ignorance.

A couple of years later, he came to me and admitted that he'd done it again. We went to counseling, but our communication issues are so lacking, we spent all of our time working on that. We never got to resolving my feelings about everything. I buried them. Deep. Deep deep deep deep.

A year after that, a friend of mine informed me that my husband had been sending sexually-charged flirtatious messages to his wife.

In all instances, these messages weren't just fantasy. They were women he knows in real life. I think it'd be easier for me if they were internet strangers or if he ever sent messages like that to me--he treats me like I'm so damn chaste.

It'd be easier for me if we had a sex life, like, at all. When we first got together, I had just gotten out of an abusive relationship. I was dealing with a lot of the fallout from that--body shame, sexual anxiety, general depression--for a long time. About two years into our relationship, we had a conversation about how he was frustrated that I don't initiate. I told him I was struggling with a lot of anxiety around sex and I needed him to help me ease into it, show me what he likes, build my confidence back up.

He didn't do that. He cheated on me by talking to these other girls instead. I understand that he probably felt undesired but. . . this certainly didn't help me at all. We now go months without having sex, which I'm sure not only feeds into his infidelity, but it has destroyed my confidence.

There's other issues here, but. . . It's been about three years since the last time I confirmed that he was sending these kinds of messages. We've had a lot of happy times since then.

I started back at therapy a few months ago and the anger, resentment, and hurt from all of this has resurfaced. I feel like it's hopeless. Three times that I know about, what about the ones I don't?

I've realized in therapy that I've blamed myself for all of these things that he's done. I blamed myself for him cheating on me. **That's not my fault.** He betrayed me. He never helped me resolve these feelings. I feel feel humiliated that these other girls, some who have met me, know just how undesirable he seems to think I am. Otherwise, why would he talk to them like that?

But it was years ago... is it wrong to want to leave someone who wronged you *years* ago?

I just want to feel desired again. I want to find someone who appreciates me and respects my boundaries. But I also feel so guilty for wanting this.

tl;dr: Husband cheated on me by sending sexually explicit messages to other girls three times throughout 6 year marriage (that I know about). My feelings were never validated. Realized in counseling that I'm still angry, hurt, and resentful. Want to leave but feel guilty."
"Ladies, why do you feel like it's okay to leave someone high and dry? I'm (24m), I see myself as a nice, respectable guy that not that bad looking. And I always have this problem that women will talk to me for bit and the suddenly just ghost me. So I'm at this girl a little while ago and I think shes great. Seemed like we were really hitting it off. We've even been able to hang out a few times for a few hours and nothing was wrong that I knew of. It seemed like she actually liked me too ,but now she isn't responding to me anymore. We've been talking on Facebook and we all know how that works, we can always see who is active and when they were. So it doesn't make sense to me with no explanation to not want to talk to me anymore."
"My first heartbreak is tearing me to pieces Today I (F 19) broke up with my first “real” bf (M 21) of a year and a half. The past couple months have been rough for me, quarantine away from him has really had me stuck in my head. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about our relationship and the differences we have as people in our lifestyles and hobbies and interests. And differences are great, they keep things interesting, until you realize that there’s more of them then there are commonalities. I feel like I’ve grown as a person a lot since we first met which led to a lot of these too. So last night for the first time in 7 weeks I saw him, and I was really hoping I would get clarity that everything was still okay and it was still good, but I got the opposite. After crying for hours this morning I decided to talk to him, as a very non confrontational person this was hard. We cried and cried for hours as I tried to explain to him why I felt this way, but I didn’t do a very good job through the snot and tears. He handled it better than I could have ever imaged but I know he is hurting because of me now, and I feel horrible. 

We ended on good terms, but this doesn’t stop me from feeling so incredibly guilty for ending things. My friends try and tell me that I deserve better and that I’ll be happier when I realize it. I’m trying, but it’s really hard. I have never loved someone as hard as I have loved him. We have good and bad memories, but right now in my sadness I can only remember the good and how I feel like I’ve ruined something. All I want is to hold him and tell him I’m sorry for hurting him and how he deserves the world, but I have already told him that and don’t want to hurt him anymore. I’ve been crying for 6 hours now, that’s how long ago this happened. When I was making my decision all I could think about is the future I could have with someone who would make me happier, but now all I can think about is the past that I had with a good guy whos heart I’ve torn to pieces for my own happiness. Happiness that doesn’t even seem real anymore. 

How in the world do you get over a break up when your heart is being pulled in every single direction."
"What do I do? I really need opinions. 
I’m typically the outcast type of person. No one really ever invites me to anything or remembers my birthday unless we’re close. I find social people irritating for some reason so I distance myself and find that other people catch onto it. How do I become social and actually enjoy others who are? I want to maintain relationships with people but it’s so hard for me. This has been so difficult for me my entire life and I need answers."
"Girlfriend liking another guys Instagram photos Recently my girlfriend of 3 years has been in a social discord server where she’s made some new internet friends, some are guys. I don’t have an issue with her having guy mates don’t get me wrong, I have girls mates but somethings giving me this shitty feeling.

My girlfriend and I are both from England and she told me most of the people in this server are from the US/Mexico. Since she’s been in that server she’s been up all night every night saying her sleeping is a mess and as we don’t live together we always had a thing that we leave our FaceTime call on (I know it’s weird haha) usually it stays on all night but recently it’s been ending every night, she’s been saying “it’s probably my WiFi because of how many tabs I have open on my PC” or “Mum sometimes turns off the WiFi” my gut says she’s lying to me. My insecurity about it has been skyrocketing because my minds been throwing together so many negative things.

She told me she has followed a some of them on Instagram and because of how Insecure I’m feeling I went snooping and found that she had liked all of one of the guys picture some dating back 2 years ago. Is this normal or should I be worried something’s going on while I sleep? She’s seemed really off with me but she tells me she’s just probably tired.

I don’t want to seem like a bad guy but she always gets mad at me when I tell her I made a new girl mate."
Am I (36/M) wrong to be upset my (35/F) g/f spent $2000 dollars on her cat's surgery? $2000 dollars we don't have. All so Fluffy can live a year or two more. My logic is it's probably better just to let Fluffy die. $2k is too much for a goddamn animal. She's willing to break up with me over this. How do I patch things up between us? Was I in the wrong?
"I (28M) broke up with ex (23F) several months ago. Breakup was over taking a job in another state. My mind just keeps churning about her. How to make it stop? I live alone in a new state that's heavily quarantined. I was about to graduate and she had a year or so left of school. We just weren't on the same page about long distance and I didn't want to take a job I'd be unhappy at. I was good to her and she was good to me. It just didn't work out. I'm not looking for pity about the break-up. Fast-forward several months later to now. I live across the country and have a new job. Still bummed about the break-up although I know it is over. I know trying to go back is not the answer. A lot of recommended things to do for a break-up are not available. I have worked from home and haven't actually met my team mates. I don't know anyone in this state. I can't make new friends. I can't go on dates. My old hobby is now my job and don't want to burn out on it. I try to do new hobbies, healthy things at home like yoga, or go on walks. Just can't focus. It's just me in my room alone. My mind just repeats conversations we had and I try to make hypothetical solutions for old arguments. I then snap out of it and say it's over move on to no avail.  Any advice on how to help let go during this quarantine?"
"I[26f] got my period while my boyfriend[25m] was going down on me, he started crying, and then told me he doesn’t want to go down on me anymore So the title is pretty self explanatory, but last night he was going down on me, and bad luck, I got my period in the middle of it. He immediately pushed me away, and it didn’t even look like that much blood, but I can see how it could be somewhat upsetting. He then started crying, which I feel is a bit of an overreaction, and then told me that he didn’t want to go down on my anymore. I didn’t argue with him or say anything then because he clearly wasn’t going to be receptive to it, so I just cleaned up and then we went to bed.

Today I asked him if he was serious last night and he said yes, he’s not going to anymore. Now I feel that yes, anyone can say no to anything, but I give him blowjobs, and I feel this is so wildly disproportionate to what happened. Plus, I find it pretty hard to get off with just his fingers and piv stuff.

Anything I can do here? I don’t want to break up with him so if that’s all you’re going to say don’t bother."
"I [19M] am so tired of being abused. Hi,

I am so damn tired of being abused. I am 19 years old. I grew up with an emotionally and physically abusive dad. My mom eventually divorced him when I was in 7th grade.

Anyways, this abuse heavily affected me, my sister (16), and brother (21). To this day, we all struggle because of it. Especially my brother.

Ever since my dad left, my brother has what I will call, “Outbreaks.” He has severe anger issues, and in these outbreaks, he will insult me in cruel ways and then escalate to breaking things in my room, throwing things, and physically assaulting me. He has been doing this for 7 years.

In the last two years, they have become horrible. He will have an outbreak, and then my mom will send him back to his college apartment.  After a few weeks, she welcomes him back with open arms, and they both pretend that nothing happened. Fast forward a few weeks, and he will have another outbreak. It is a constant cycle. 

One example of an outbreak is what he did a year ago from this week. He stole my credit card, and I told him to bring it back. He eventually did, but he bent it up and cut it. I then stood up for myself but he punched a hole in my computer monitor, messed in my room, and beat me on my bedroom floor. 

Tonight, he had another outbreak. He gets set off by the littlest of things. He is screaming and cussing at me as my mom and sister sit there crying defenselessly. They beg him to quit, but he escalates. He degrades me, insults me, and talks about how he will beat my face in, and fuck me up. He Insinuates how worthless I am. Tonight, he never got a chance to hit me because I left. Although that’s true, he broke things in my room and tore it apart. He then texted me “Come home you pussy.” In the past, he has physically assaulted me many times, and I’m not just talking about a fight between siblings. He will punch me in the face and beat me up. 

I have had enough. Everyone tells me to fight back, but I don’t want to (He is my size,  but I don’t want to do that in front of my mom and sister.) that would ruin them. I try to call the cops, but my mom and sister cry and beg me not to. Per usual, I flee to my friends house and just sit here and cry. 

I start college in two months, and I will be at the same school as him. He doesn’t admit that anything is wrong with him, and he terrifies me. He is terrifyingly abusive and evil. My mom keeps trying to make things right but I can’t do this anymore. I never want to see him again in my life. Truly, I just don’t know what to do. I just need advice and am wondering if anyone has been through something similar, and what you have done :("
"My (F18) boyfriend’s (M18) relationships with his exes / ex FWBs make me uncomfortable My boyfriend made a remark the other day about how he “needs to go see a movie” with his ex-girlfriend because that was his “movie partner” and they “loved Marvel movies.” 

This ex girlfriend was with him for six months, and for most of our friendship leading up to our relationship he would constantly talk about how he’d take her back in a heartbeat if she asked. I told him that was what made me uncomfortable about the situation, and that I’d prefer if he didn’t do those things with her. He got upset with me and told me they’re “just friends,” and then said, “You’re gonna take my movie partner away?” 

This also hurt because I am his girlfriend, I think, and I am also a nerd who loves Marvel movies and just movies in general?? He asked me why it upset me that he said that, an I told him that it was because they dated that they were movie partners. He asked if I would feel better if they went in a group, and I’m willing to make that compromise, but I’m still extremely uncomfortable.

My boyfriend is also a popular kid (tm), he has about a million friends. I also have this issue with him and another person who treated him poorly that he still keeps around and often seems to flirt with. 

They were identifying as male at the time, and my boyfriend came very close to being intimate with them while they (the person) were in an open relationship. Unfortunately this same person lead him on, manipulated him, and walked all over him and I sat by as his friend at the time. I saw every panic attack and painful vent that came from that, and it upsets me that he insists on keeping them around. They often text him things like ‘I’m bored’ ‘pay attention to me’ ‘give me attention’ and he almost always replies, sometimes with things like ‘then come and get it.’ I asked him if he could perhaps cut back on the amount of communication / flirting especially, since this person is not even a close friend (just a kid he gets work from for his school now?) but he told me that they apologized and are trying to change. 

I explained to him that the way they think they own him upsets me, but he just doesn’t seem to care. This cuts extra deep as I got out of a 2yr + relationship before this where my ex-boyfriend did the same thing to me and it turned out he was with another girl behind my back the whole time. 

I’m not really sure what to do in this situation. I know that he values those two friends, and I believe that is valid, but I’m so uncomfortable. We’re both willing and open communicators, and he’s really a nice guy, this is just a too-close-to-home issue for me that I’m not sure how to combat. 

TLDR: My boyfriend is still friends with his ex he said he’d take back in a heartbeat &amp; another who treated him like shit. It upsets me for a lot of reasons, and the way he interacts with them both makes me uncomfortable but he doesn’t really seem to understand or care. I’m not sure what to do, so any advice is helpful. 

I am also aware that we are young and that this may be perceived as silly or immature, but I’d really appreciate any helpful advice."
"My (23F) Boyfriend's (22M) brother killed himself 6 months ago. Things seem to be getting worse. As stated in the title, my boyfriend's brother killed himself 6 months ago.  I have been doing my best to love my boyfriend unconditionally while giving him space when needed.  I thought if I stay optimistic,  make sure he eats and showers and stays active/doing things he loves, that (even though I knew it'd be a long journey)  that things would improve.  It's beeen 6 months and it actually seems things are getting worse?

Today he told me he wants to be dead.  I got him to call his best friend today and try to keep him in touch with people who love him.  I'm scared that things are getting worse and don't know where to go from here.  He frequently has panic attacks that I hold him through (hyperventilating, sobbing) and calm him down getting him to breath deeply. The quarantine from coronavirus has only made things harder as he's isolated, out of work, and directionless.

If anyone can provide advice or words of wisdom, I would so so appreciate it.

Edit: he is in therapy and has been since it happened. "
"Quarantine is making my Bf and I miss important dates together. What online/remote ideas can we utilize to make it sting less? 
As with most people COVID is, to put it eloquently, royally fing me and my boyfriend. We were kicked out of our dorms the day before our 6th month anniversary and the big date we had planned alongside it. His birthday was only 2 weeks after that and obviously I was unable to spend it with him other than a few hours in video call. We've both been doing all we can to still feel close. We call every night for 3-4 hours, sent care packages back and forth, write letters. But our 8th month is coming up and while outside of the first and big anniversaries we don't go crazy. But we had a tradition of being with each other at midnight so we could wish each other happy however many months it was and then just taking an extra hour or two to ourselves. It sounds cheesy but this is my first real long term relationship and I'm really in love with him. I'm kind of stuck on good ideas to make this upcoming anniversary important. Both of us are really homesick and want to see each other and I just want to make it a bit easier for both of us since its been two months since we've been able to see each other. Is anyone else struggling with this sort of thing?  Does anyone have cute date ideas or anything we could do online?"
"Is it important to share your body count with your partner? I’ve never shared my actually number of people I’ve slept with (24f) with my boyfriend(28m). He’s never asked because he’s focused on the present and our current relationship but I’ve actually hooked up with two of his friends years before him and I realized our connection. (He knows about his friends and me, both were short flings) I have this feeling deep in me that I want to share my number because i’ve never told any guy before and it would just be liberating but I’m not really proud of it also.. it’s conflicting. My question is, do people in serious relationships share the number of sexual partners they’ve had with each other? Should I eventually? I don’t think he cares to know. He and I know we are both together for stability and commitment so it doesn’t really matter"
"The quarantine has ruined it. It's not that it's ruined, I just don't know what to do. I'm a (just turned) 17yd male and I've been with my girlfriend, 15yd Female, for 6 month this past Thursday and the stay at home order brought new challenges. At first I thought that everything was going okay but I was able to get out and hang with people and I haven't been able to see her as much. And I know I love her but I have started thinking about us as individuals and I feel like I'm pulling away.
It's not that she isn't great it's just I'm starting to feel like we aren't a good fit but at the same time I feel like it's just the stay-at-home order.
I know I'm more physical person because words can't express things well, so I don't know if these new feelings would have come naturally or are in effect of the quarantine and not being able to be physical.
I don't know what to do."
"I'm having trouble seeing whether my crush likes me or i trying to be nice. So we were texting and we started talking about our insecurities. I said mine was my smile, and then she said that I shouldn't feel insecure because my smile is cute.

On that same night, I explained how my hair was getting fluffy again after I had taken a shower, and she said that she thinks fluffy hair is cute (I have really fluffy hair).

On another night, I said ""gn :)"", and then she replied with ""gn ;)"".

In school, she would put her head on my shoulder while watching movies.

I like explaining and teaching things to people, and one day she said that she likes when people teach her.



Are these obvious signs that she likes me? Or is she just trying to be nice? I'm not too sure."
"My girlfriend (23f) has all kinds of sex dreams about me (24m) and stripping When we first started dating she told me she dreamed about sandwiches but they turned sexual really quick. To give a couple of examples:

&amp;#x200B;

* She dreamed about being a stripper and had an arrangement with other strippers at a clients house. At the house a male stripper appeared and another stripper wanted to blow him she said. When he undid his pants a absolute enormous penis filled the room. After that they wanted to go out and party but the clubs were boring due to a low amount of people (corona)

&amp;#x200B;

* She said that we were on beach together on holiday and everyone around us started having sex with eachother, and that we also started having sex.

&amp;#x200B;

* Last night she dreamed about me jerking off in my own bedroom but when she entered the room i quickly pulled the covers over me.

&amp;#x200B;

And some more dreams i can't really remember. Now our sex-life isn't boring at all. She likes it hard, rather rough and the screws started falling out of my bed. The point is i can give her what she wants and needs. She has trouble climaxing but i always get her to climax before i do. I take my time for that. We try new things, new locations. we're both very experimental and open about what we like and don't like. To rule out any unfulfilled satisfactions. Why, if we are so sexual in real life she still dreams about sex so much, i asked her and she doesn't know."
"Have you ever been lead on? If so how did you deal with it? I feel like I was lead on F[20]

To give some context we’re both college student in San Diego, he’s a fourth year M[21] about to graduate and go to grad school in the east coast, and I’m a third year F[20] 


I had been talking to this guy for 3 months and we were having a really good time, it’s fair to say we hit it off instantly and whenever we were together we were always laughing and joking around. But there was always doubts in our mind that maybe we were best suited as just friends. He broke things off with me a couple weeks before quarantine started and I agreed in that I also felt that we were better suited as friends. We tried to just be friends but every time we hung out it just felt natural to be intimate with each other. After about a week I realized I liked him too much to keep being friends with benefits. I told him how I felt and he didn’t seem interested in continuing to pursue the relationship so we stopped talking. Then quarantine happened and we went our separate ways. 

We started talking again recently and it was normal, like we were catching up but then he started being flirty again and given that I still liked him I flirted back. This went on for about 2 weeks before I was able to go see him again. 
We hung out the whole day Monday and he was again very intimate (and I’m not just talking about sex), he would hold my hand and open the door for me and he even took me to go see the bioluminescence at the beach right now because I mentioned it to him a while back. I didn’t feel like going anymore but he insisted he take me because I would regret not going later. 

I feel like these things have emotional significance and someone that was just trying to have sex wouldn’t do. Things were going great so I told him I still had feelings for him and he said he wasn’t sure what he wanted. And I respect his decision 100% I was just sad that he was flirting with me and being so intimate when he knew how I felt about him. He said he didn’t know that I still had feelings for him and he was sorry, his apology seemed genuine. A little confused as to why someone would be so intimate and not want something serious. Was I lead on? His birthday is also coming up and I got him a gift of a sweater to the grad school he’s going to and I don’t know if I should give it to him anymore? Any advice? I’m heartbroken 

Also important to note I believe he was still talking to his ex. We were looking at reddit posts and I asked him if he could send me one and when he went to share it the first contact that popped up was his exs name. To my knowledge they hadn’t been in contact for months. I’m not sure what to make of all of this."
"My[17] mother is going ballistic over my boyfriend bringing me breakfast. I don’t know what to do. When she first confronted me about the lime (that’s all that was left) I genuinely forgot where it came from. I said it was from our fruit basket and she screamed until I realized it was from my Sonic Cherry limeade. I told her and yeah. 


From this she’s told me she’s disappointed in me and is accusing me of sneaking out with him at night, going in our shed and having sex, and sneaking him in during the day when nobody is home. It’s not because of the corona scare, she said if I ever do this again I’m grounded. She also said she’s calling his parents to make sure it’s not a lie that he just brought my food. She’s checking all the cameras and I told her to check the damn cameras.

Edit: She also asked why he brought it to me anyways. “Is it because you tell people we don’t have any food at the house.”
No man my boyfriend wanted to do a kind gesture since we haven’t seen each other in so long.

I can’t stand it, I can’t even go out of my room without her screaming and insulting me and my dad laughing at me."
"Girlfriend never compliments my penis? I know this might shallow off the bat, but hear me out. She’s been with a few other guys, and I’ve asked her if they were bigger than me and she said no, but she also has been known to tell white lies like that if she thinks it will hurt our relationship and if there’s nothing she can do about it. 

But back to the point, I always tell her how much I love her body and such, but I think she’s said she’s liked my dick like 3 times ever?  I don’t really care, I’m 6.5x6.5 so I know I’m not tiny, but it’s just nice to hear that your partner is sexually satisfied by you. I’ve asked her what she’s thought about it and she always seems so reluctant to say she likes it. Is this normal?"
"my boyfriend isn’t taking covid seriously and i feel like its a sign he doesn’t care about me or my health issues currently because of the covid situation i (21f) haven’t seen my bf (22m) in over a month. 

i have asthma and previous health issues that would make it very bad if i were to get sick and my mom has respiratory health issues as well so my family has been taking this very seriously with social distancing. since i haven’t seen my bf in forever, my parents agreed he could move in with us if he also began taking everything seriously and upon coming to our house, would have to self isolate completely for two weeks. 

about a week or two ago, my bf left his apartment (he lived alone but was still hanging out with people) and moved into his family home with uncle and sister. his sister has health issues that would make it difficult if she got sick and i thought it would be better if he were there because he would take everything much more seriously for her safety. well, tonight he and i are on the phone and i hear someone in the background. i ask who is there and he says his cousin (who doesn’t live with him, but four other family members). i get annoyed and tell him that he shouldn’t be seeing anyone, but he says it fine and they’re inside the house sitting six feet apart. then he tells me that the day before, his grandparents and aunt were over at the house too to celebrate his birthday. i’m very upset at this point and he says it’s fine because everyone is taking it seriously - which to me isn’t true because they wouldn’t be gathering if this were the case.

as a result, i don’t want him moving in with my parents and i. i would feel awful if he were to be sick and bring it into the house and one of my older parents got it. i’m also questioning my relationship with him in general. i don’t think he would have even told me he was hanging out with people if i hadn’t overheard his cousin. that makes me feel like he was just going to come here and potentially put everyone in danger. not only that, but because of my own health issues it could result in a very bad situation for me if i were to contract it and it comes across as though he doesn’t care when he’s knowingly around other people, but is still planning on coming to stay with me. 

i don’t know if i’m overreacting or if this is a sign of his lack of concern for my wellbeing and i need to end things."
"Should I break up with BF (31M) for masturbating to photos of my (28F) friend (28F) TLDR: I saw BF (31M) had started watching/looking at porn, then immediately searched all social media for my (28F) friend (28F), should I break up?

Title says it all--I saw BF (31M) had started watching/looking at porn, then immediately searched all social media for my (28F) friend (28F). Looking for advice from people who've gone through this.

There were at least a dozen iterations of her name in his searches before he found her--her name is also very uncommon, so it wasn't like a ""Katie Smith"" or something that could be misconstrued.

I'm super fucking hurt. I literally don't want to see either of them, though it's not her fault.

I can't get over this. It happened 2-3 months ago, and I was going to have a bonfire at our house tonight, but they'll both be there and I had a panic attack thinking about the shame and humiliation. So I canceled.

I don't care that I saw his search history--we have an open phone policy, and that part I don't care about people scrutinizing--everyone has an opinion about phone security, and he's free to search my phone too, I have nothing to hide. We both agreed to this-- if he cared he'd change his phone password and I'd respect his privacy, simple as that.

I don't generally have a huge problem with porn. This though...this is like a dagger, I feel so much pain. It's cheating in my book, plain and simple.

Feeling lost. He's never done anything like this level of cheating, virtually or in person.

Should I break up with him over this, how could I ever trust him again? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I saw BF (31M) had started watching/looking at porn, then immediately searched all social media for my (28F) friend (28F), should I break up?"
Ex and the breakup So my ex broke up with me 2 years ago. I’ve dated and seen other people but nobody gives me the same thrill and butterflies in the beginning. Like when I laid eyes on my ex I immediately felt infatuation and a need to change for them. Nobody I meet now gives me that type of excitement. Nobody compares to her looks and I feel like she is the most beautiful person in this planet.  Thus is drawing me back. Has Anyone been through this and any suggestions?
"Need advice for dealing with girlfriend being EXTREMELY angry about stay at home orders \*do not comment “leave her” that is not on the table, I want ADVICE for dealing with this issue WITH HER. We have been together for over 3 years and she is perfect for me, this is the first thing she has done to be genuinely on my nerves.\* \*and PLEASE do not debate the stay at home orders in the comments. I want advice not a fight\*

TLDR girlfriend is spending unreasonable amounts of time being furious about our state's stay at home order and ranting to me even though I said I was tired of it

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend (20F) (I am 21F) recently has been mad about our governor shutting down our state. Saying its unconstitutional, etc which isn’t the part I’m mad about because I want to reopen the state too. BUT she is spending way too much of her time acting all pissed about it. Like she was bringing up ALL THE TIME how she’s mad and we need to reopen. No exaggeration. I’d say something like “oh X place is open now” and she’d say “yeah and everything else needs to open too” in a pissed off tone and it eventually got on my nerves so I told her to stop it and she said “ugh fine” and gave me the silent treatment for a few minutes. Since then she has been doing it again, and much worse. Always sending me articles and facts about it and attaching pissy comments to it ""he is a fucking asshole"" etc when I already made it clear I am not interested in constant discussions and bitching about this topic. And today she had this project to finish for online school so she said we couldn’t do our lunch date like we planned, so I was fine with that, but the whole time she was “working on her project” she was posting rants to Snapchat and Twitter about our governor!! It really bothers me because I am uncomfortable with the idea of her being so angry for such a large amount of her day… I can’t imagine what that does to her and I want to discuss it with her and was hoping for some advice. Her being pissed doesn't make it any better for anyone!! TIA!!"
"Almost a month after meeting this girl online, 3 dates in, already exclusive and talking about ""when we are a couple""... When will I know to ask her to be my GF? 22M and met 22F on Hinge. We spent 2 weeks talking before meeting (due to quarantine) several days of 4-5hours of talking on the phone. Then last Friday we had our first date, and since have hung out twice more (hard to do too much when everything is closed but we doing at-home-dates I guess). We already have a weekend planned for next week too for dates 4 and 5...

---

I've never dated so idk the ""progression"" to being LTR as BF/GF.

She's brought up multiple times how she ""sees me in her future"" and ""can't wait to date"" and ""thinks we will be a cute couple"" and ""would love to be my GF"".

It seems she uses ""date"" interchangeable with ""SO/GF/BF"". We are not seeing anyone else. We are both really into each other and wanna keep seeing and will with more and more dates. To me this is literally ""dating"".

We have progressed sexually but No sex of course (we layed without our shirts on as I gave her a massage). she even mentioned ""if we were dating [again I believe she means as official BF/GF] I would've given you a surprise ;) since it's your b-day""... 

---

**My question is when/how will I know to ask her to ""be my GF."" At what point will I think ""okay NOW is the time""**, Because to me it seems like we are already in that state. Sure we are in quaranntine and can't do too much but I've spent 40+ hours with her and continue to see her. Sex doesn't make it official and we are already exclusive to seeing each other."
"I caught my ex being a manipulative ( narcissistic ) So I decided to meet up with my ex today after a few weeks of taking a break. We just met up for dinner. 

I always new he was a narcissist because I often felt like he was to me but never could actually figure it out. He always would turn things around on me. 

Tonight During our conversation, he was telling me how he manipulated ( didn’t use that word) his neighbor into moving into another unit because he was so annoyed at his neighbor for always complaining about his noise level. 

He is actually friends with his neighbor so he told his neighbor that a new unit opened up down the hall and it was much bigger and nicer but for cheaper price ( not sure if the price was actually cheaper) And he told him that he will no longer have to deal with the street noise level anymore and he should move to the new unit. 

He said all that to him just to get him to move so he doesn’t have to deal with him anymore. 

Well, the guy actually thought about it and inquired and actually moved! 
My ex was so happy and was like “ yes I’m so happy it worked!! I don’t have to deal with him anymore” 

Anyways as I was listening to him tell me this story, I just couldn’t help but to think how incredibly manipulative this was and how this was a perfect example of why our relationship was so crazy. He would do things to me that I often felt like I was crazy. 

What are you thoughts? Do you think this was super narcissistic?"
"As the non-depressed partner in a relationship, I'm struggling to maintain the happiness I once had. I'm looking for advice for the NON depression person in the relationship. I've been with my partner for about 2.5 years now. He's always had depression of some level, but we have been able to manage through things. He always tells me that he wants to be happy and that the best thing I can do while he's depressed is to just keep being happy because it will eventually help pull him out of it.

When the depression hits hard, he can become critical and short tempered. I try to be happy as he tells me that I should be in these states, but then he tares it down with his reactions. I try to brush it off, but if I feel hurt, then it's because I ""make it always about myself"" and I ""don't understand what depression is like."" He'll tell me that when he's in these states that I need to be loving toward him, but when I've been hurt by his reactions, it's hard to then want to cuddle up to him, say or do nice things, etc. When he says or does something hurtful, then I just want to remove myself, but then I'm ""being distant"" when he needs me. I've addressed that I don't know what to do because when I follow his advice on how to react, he has some new reason as to why it's not the right reaction.

So with COVID, we have both been working from home. In a small, open space, we have to balance when we're on calls at the same time because we're practically working on top of one another. Every day he's sighing in frustration over his coworkers, and I'm constantly hearing him say things like ""this stupid person!"" or just ""oh my God""! These constant expressions of frustration at everything stress me out regardless of whether I'm having a good day or a stressful day. If I voice this opinion or try to help him to not look at everything in such a bad light, he gets frustrated with me.

His argument is that he's a very passionate person and he needs to be able to express both his positive and his negative emotions. If I don't let him express the negative emotions, then he's not being genuine to himself. But his negative emotions sit between 50 and 80% of his emotions anymore, and it's really starting to weigh down both my time at work as well as my evenings when I really just want to relax and be happy.

We've been arguing a bit the past few days, and he's telling me that I have problems dealing with my emotions in a healthy manner because I don't let them out. The truth I'm extremely resilient and can let things go that shouldn't have an impact on my life.. In the long run, I'm usually known as the optimistic, uplifting person in my friend groups. I don't think it's unhealthy at all. But I am finding that I'm able to handle less and less of his depressed state, and my resilience is starting to break down here.

He tells me that he doesn't try to change me or make me feel bad about the things in my life (which is true), and that it's selfish that I'm trying to make him change. The truth is, I let him be in his depressed state 95% of the time. I have read so many articles about trying to be there and be supportive to a depressed partner, and I try to abide by it and what he tells me he needs as much as possible. But 5% of the time, I just want a stress-free work day and a happy evening.

I guess what I'm ultimately asking for is advice. Not on how to deal with a depressed partner, but how to find happiness despite having a depressed partner. All of these articles make me feel like it's wrong to ask for a happy evening. They seem to cater to the depressed person. But I now realize what an impact a depressed partner can have on those around them, and I need advice for myself to make sure I'm not taking on too much negativity from his depression.

Thank you in advance!"
Is giving my girlfriend a note on how I feel a b*tch move Sometimes I write what’s exactly on my mind instead of telling my committed girlfriend. Lately I’ve had a lot of shit running through and head and get alittle nervous to bring it up. I feel like giving her the note about how I feel is a good thing because it will help me become more confident and later tell her how I’m feeling down the road. But on another note am I acting like a pussy not saying it to her and writing my thoughts on a note?
"I don't know what is wrong with me Hey so i want to know if this is normal. I met a girl when I was 14, we got together till I was 16. I cheated once when I was very drunk (In my country we start drinking very early) that fucked me up and I realized what i did to the one person I loved. We broke up and since then I've had a few girlfriends and now I am 19 but I can't get her out of my mind I really can't. We talk a lot, i help her with everything i can and i realized I haven't stop loving her since I was a kid. I told her how i feel in several occassions and she always tells me that she doesn't want to be with anybody and i get that so I try my best to just forget her. But everything makes me think of her and I know its just stupid that I keep trying with a person that really doesn't want to be with me, I get that but I can't stop talking to her and wishing the best for her, she probably will go to Italy and study there. I want to know if is it normal no not be able to stop loving an ex girlfriend and why i can't, even when I am dating another girl it always comer back to her. Please help me."
"Am I not enough? Hey guys 
I'm F (22) and my boyfriend M(23) have been in an interracial long-distance relationship for almost 6 months now (total 2 years) as he is stuck in China because of the COVID situation. We study in Melbourne together. I recently discovered that he has been jerking off to his old female friends (his ex crushes) and models even though we do cam stuff to keep things interesting. We had a very active sex life when he was in Melbourne. He told me that he thought about these women cause they rejected him and wanted to get back at them. Is it me? Am I not enough or is it his issue. I don't know what to do Should I just break it off? I'm very conscious about myself and my body as I'm a brown girl and he has been fantasizing about all white and Asian girls. Whenever I try to leave him he never lets me leave, he starts crying and starts emotionally manipulating me into staying. He says he loves me but he is broken. I don't know if it's a race thing or am I not as pretty as white women. (I've been discriminated because I have dusky skin so I have a lot of past issues) is it me or him I feel i'm just not enough for anyone."
I feel overlooked and under appreciated My boyfriend won’t stop talking about how nothing good has happened to him in the past 10 years. We’ve only been dating for half a year but we already live together... Hearing him constantly talk about how there’s nothing good in his life makes me feel worthless to him. I feel like I shouldn’t even be around. I try very hard to make this man happy and it doesn’t seem to work. Just makes me want to pack my bags and leave. Am I taking these things too personally? Am I over reacting?
"How to fall out of love in less than 24 hours? Lol Falling in love wayyy too quickly.. I know this a dumb question, but I've gotta try.."
"My (22f) boyfriend (22m) thinks I don’t want him to see his friends and family , which isn’t true! We don’t live together but he’s been staying with me the past 6 weeks during lockdown.
I work till 4pm and he said he was going to go to his parent house and collect me from work then. His parents house is 30km away and we’re currently allowed to go only 5km away. I had absolutely no problem with this.
He then told me he was going on a boat trip with a few friends and won’t be over to my house till 9pm
I was annoyed because he’d cancelled our plans and also annoyed that he’s meeting groups of friends during all this.
He claims I’m keeping him from his friends and family but that’s just not the case. I wouldn’t care if it was a normal day but it’s not, we had plans and there are restrictions in place .I’ve made my views clear but he still insists I’m trying to keep him from his friends. 
He told me at the start of the relationship that his ex had a problem with him going home to see his family and now I’m wondering if that was even true.
I feel like he’s twisting my words, is this a red flag I should worry about?"
"My family and I are stuck with my abusive father. To fully understand my (16F) situation and my dad (42M) I have to explain a bit of backstory. 

My dad used to physically abuse my siblings (12F) and (14M) and I when we were younger. He would punch/slap me and slam me against the floor, wall, furniture, etc. He would often step on me (especially on my head) and put a lot of his weight into it. He suffocated us so that we would stop crying by putting his hands over our nose and mouth and holding us down against the bed for a long time. Like, until I felt I was fucking blacking out and I stopped moving. This went on from when I was 9 -11, but more heavily when he was unemployed for a year. I was the one that got it the worst because I would try to defend my brother and sister. 

It's difficult for me to recall stuff from the time because I repressed a lot of it. My siblings were younger than I was so they don't remember most of it. Mostly they remember the suffocation because that was my dad's favorite. We didn't tell my mom (38F) because he told us she already knew and that this was how bad kids got disciplined. My mom found out last year when I was diagnosed with severe depression and I told my mom everything. However, my dad managed to gaslight my brother into thinking none of it happened and my sister said she just remembered being suffocated. So, my mom thinks that I was just exaggerating or remembering wrong. 

Now, my family has been going through a really tough time lately. We were evicted from our house in December and my aunt offered to let us live in her house until my parents got back on their feet. 

We're still here and although the stimulus we got a few weeks back is really comforting, we have very little money at the moment. My mom has been applying to jobs non-stop and she works for instacart and lyft to help pay for the storage unit we are renting out with all our stuff. 

My dad (42M) occasionally does instacart, but has outright refused to apply to jobs because he suffers from anxiety before the interviews. He blows up every couple of weeks or months (the longest he's gone without doing this was 5 months) and every time it consists of him throwing away our valuables, getting violent, destroying our things/furniture, threatening to burn down the house, or threatening to kill himself.  Recently he gave my mom a black eye, but we have almost no money and no where to go, so he knew he would get away with it. That was the first time he hit my mom, but I'm afraid that it won't be the last. 

Well, today he had one of his tantrums and he dumped out near boiling water on the stove, which splashed back and burnt parts of my stomach. He did it because I wouldn't go get my phone charger for him upstairs the second he asked me to. My mom heard me scream and she came running out and told him to get the fuck out of the house and he just stood there stating at him. She started breaking down crying and he laughed in her face. She didn't want to make a scene while my aunt and uncle were upstairs so we went to her room. My mom helped me put an ointment we have for sunburns. Thankfully, the burns weren't that bad because I had a shirt and apron on when the hot water splashed on me. 

This sort of thing has happened many times and even though my mom would like nothing more than to leave his ass, we are financially trapped. Most of the important titles are under my dad's name and after our truck was towed and repossessed, we only have one car. If my mom kicked him out he'd taking the car and most of the little amount of money we have with him. 

I need help. I don't know what to do or how to help my mom and I can't even go to a friend's house to get away from him because of COVID-19. I'll try to answer any questions you may have, if anyone has a solution or even some advice it would be greatly appreciated."
"I [19M] confessed to a girl [19F], she said she's not sure and is confused. What to do next? So 2 months ago i started hanging with two girls from my class. We would all hang out, watch movies together, chat, do homework and so on. This went on for about two months. One of them is free(A) and one already has a boyfriend(B). 

One day while we were all out and it was time to go home I asked her(A) if i should walk her home and she said ""score"". This happened a couple more times, and every time she seemed very happy about it. So one day I ask in our group chat if they all want to hang out, A says yes but B says shes busy and we shouldn't mind going out without her. This was the first time we went out alone. We were talking w/o stopping and we also laughed a lot. It was quite nice. So about this time I started catching feelings. All 3 of us went together out a couple more times after this.

 Now for the part i need advice about. Yesterday I asked A in private if she wanted to go out alone and she said yes. We went out at about 7:30PM and it was maybe 2:AM when I decided to walk her home. So we walked and stopped in front of her home. That's when I decided it was a good moment to confess to her. I said I have something to tell her and said I like her. She said something like ""oh boy I knew this was coming"" and said she's ""not sure if she actually likes me or just as a friend"" and that she's ""confused with her feelings"". After this we hugged, said goo night and went home. Now I don't think I read the signs incorrectly, I think we both like each other and she's just too shy... From what I know this would be the first time any of us went out with someone, and I think both of us never kissed anyone. 

So my question for you people is: What should be my next move? Should I apologise for being too direct, taking things too quick or what? How do I take it from here?"
Worried for my best friend after she has accepted her ex? My best friend has accepted her ex’s friend request and I’m worried she will get hurt again. I don’t know what I can do.
"Interesting times Hi all, new to reddit so forgive me if my post seems off, but anyways I’ve been in a relationship with my gf for 10 months now, she’s 5 years older then me. The relationship has been great really with just a couple small hiccups in the beginning but since all the covid craziness my 34 yo gf (I’m 29)who teaches at an elementary school has been working from home and seems to be going a little crazy during all this.A couple weeks ago now she had an aunt whom she was close with pass away ( I never met her but certainly can’t imagine going thru that atm) I’ve tried to be there for her in any way I can. And my life hasn’t changed much atm as I’m a millwright by trade and still working. To add too the covid craziness, a girl who I used to flirt with reached out too me and got a touch in appropriate by saying I shouldn’t have gotten a gf. My gf found the message on my phone and we have since moved past it.... or so I was told. Now those small hiccups in the beginning of our relationship was I have a friend of mine who I’ve slept with but we haven’t pursued anything in a long time. Everything that happened was prior to my gf and I told her so she wouldn’t be surprised if it ever came up. Her on the other hand prior to me, she was sleeping with another guy, he countinued to text and send inappropriate pictures to her even tho she would tell him to stop (I saw the messages) she was very open about who he was and he disappeared for a bit but surprise came back sending more inappropriate messages that happened 4 times now after the third I made it clear my opinion was if he’s going to be like that she should just block him. She did and yet the 4th and most recent time he called her and professed his love for her. I think it got to her abit even dispite what she tells me. That all ended with me snapping a bit. Frankly I don’t get how or why this guy continues to come around when my gf makes it known she has me. During the death of her aunt she was out of town for a social distanced close family gathering. Me still working and never having met these people never questioned her going alone but then during our recent arguments she tells me that an old friend was at the gathering and made it clear he was interested in her. Now I’m wondering how many guys this girl has around and if I’m really the only one around. She doesn’t think she can have kids and hit me up talking about adoption and invetro today. When covid first hit she approached me about helping her thru school to stop teaching and become a lawyer. Odly enough when I asked the type of law she said criminal. My ex used to work at a criminal law firm. For the past 10 months I’ve felt both of us have been happy and on the same page with not perfect but not bad communication which seems to be a struggle to find these days. Currently tho I feel her signals are all over and she’s over analyzing while stuck working from home. She says our sex life is great and she just wants to be engaged as a commitment for the future. I don’t feel I’m ready for that yet as 10 months doesn’t feel long enough to me. Now I guess if you read all that then thanks and whatever advice or thoughts let me know"
"Can't stop thinking about summer fling 3 years ago I (F21) have been in an almost two year relationship with M27. This is my first serious relationship. I am super close to his family and extended family. We have a savings $ together, bought a car together, and talk a lot about the future. Weve been through a lot and we have our ups and downs like every couple but I notice that I have this personal re-occurring issue.

My issue is that I love my boyfriend so much and I really do see a future with him but I feel its so unfair to him that I'm still thinking about T (M23) who I spent only 2-3 months with 3 years ago. Prior to that summer fling, I had just got out of a very toxic relationship with little to no self esteem and so much negativity. So meeting and spending time with T was one of the most happiest times of my life  for a change - care free, touring around the city (he lives in a different country and he was just visiting), just having so much fun with no strings attached.. and then I caught very deep feelings for him. Only after spending 2-3 months I was so sure that he was my soul mate since we had a connection I've never experienced with anyone else, even my current bf. T was never straightforward with the way he felt about me so after a few months of chatting long distance I decided to put those feelings aside and meet new people, which is when I met my current boyfriend now. T told me after I started dating my current bf that he did have the same feelings for me but cannot do a long distance relationship. It was a really confusing time but I chose to stay with my bf. I didn't see the point of leaving my bf to be with someone who didn't see a future with me or wasn't going to work towards one. 

T and I maintained some contact up until last year until it felt like my feelings for him were re-surfacing again. I believe my feelings re-surface for the most part because I reminisce a lot about the summer fling. We haven't talked for a few months and I can't stop thinking about him, sometimes even sexually. 

What should I do? Will my thoughts about T ever go away? I have tried talking about this with my bf and asked if he ever thinks of past friends or exes and his response is always ""why would I think about anyone else when I'm happy with you"" and I feel SO guilty because its not that I am unhappy in my relationship. Somtimes I just miss my care free days and it happened to be that time with T. Should I attempt to talk to my bf about this issue more? Is it selfish to keep these thoughts to myself and work things out on my own? I really need help.

*edit* TLDR; F21 in a serious 2 year relationship but can't stop thinking about a summer fling I had 3 years ago. What should I do?"
"Boyfriend thinks I lie about everything...? I understand not believing stories to a certain extent because you weren't there, but damn. If he isn't there it didn't happen. Its just so irritating because I can't even tell him a nice part of my day without him questioning the hell out of it like it was a lie. And he gets super worked up about it, like he 100% knows its a lie, even though it isn't. Things like tonight, talking about how this guy just put a few dollars on my tank for me at the gas station. That really happened! He put ten dollars on my tank! Just little mundane things like that, he's so convinced I'm lying about, and he's told me that. I just dont know what to do. It makes me sad because it just seems like I can't tell him about what I did or something funny/nice that happened. What's the point in telling him if he's just convinced I'm lying?"
"THROWRA: (M21) Chatting with someone (F) and getting to know her. Advice? Normally I don’t have a hard time getting to know someone and becoming friends through face-to-face interaction. A girl, around my age I guess, in one of my online college class really caught my attention and so afterwards I asked her to be partners for a pair activity. So we were texting for that day in order to finish it and just had little casual conversation, like 3 replies and then it died. She was very open to talking before tho, and seemed really nice.

As I said, getting to know her face to face is obviously easier for me, but since we’re in quarantine I don’t know what to do. Any help/advice on this would mean a lot to me, from a women’s perspective specially!"
"My (26F) dad (50M) wants to go to church but I don't want to and I'm not sure how to tell him. My dad wasn't in the picture very much. He's a truck driver and he was home 1-3 days a month sometimes not even that. After my mom and him got divorced I didn't see him outside of maybe a vacation every couple of years with the occasional text or call every couple of months. It wasn't until April  of this year I had to move in with him because of some circumstance with my mom that ended up with her in jail. I don't have a license nor do I have a job (didn't have one before corona either because I was a student). 

So, he didn't raise me and I don't share any of his beliefs. My dad is your typical southern Christian man. Christianity is the one and only religion and if you believe in anything else you're going to hell and you're wrong. A couple of days ago my sister ended up telling him how she was Atheist and he basically said she was wrong to believe that and she was going to hell, blah blah. He mentioned a couple of days ago that they were going to church again. I'm STRONGLY against this not only because coronavirus but simply because I don't think I should have to go if I don't even believe in anything that's being said. I respect his religion and if believing in that stuff makes him happy then fine, but I don't think I need to be forced to listen to it when he can't even show some respect to me or my sister's believes. What if I was a Buddhist or something, would that still be wrong in his eyes? I just can't get behind that. I've been to the service they attend a couple times and already know it's just not my thing. Also being that I'm 26 I have an idea on what I believe in and that stuff just isn't my jam. 

Basically, when it comes up again I'm not sure how to say I don't want to go and don't think I really should. I know I'm 26 and should be able to make decisions like these on my own but I'm afraid disagreeing with him will end with me being kicked out. I can't afford that because no license, no driving experience, and job experience. Not to mention, I'd end up under a bridge because I have no one here besides my dad."
"Am I in a dead bedroom? 30m. Gf (30f) never initiates sex and I feel she isn’t into it much when we have it. 
Gf is 30f. Been together a year, just moved in together. I have a high libido but she has a low libido compared to mine. She has little experience, so she says. 

She never initiates. Sex will simply not happen if I don’t initiate. When we do have sex, she seems not very into it with comments like “are you going to cum soon?” And “feel better?” After sex. 

This caused a fight a few nights ago. We were going at it and she asks if I’m going to cum soon. I stopped and immediately went to sleep in another room. The next morning she yells at me and asks why I’m ignoring her, I stayed calm and told her she was sexually dysfunctional, and comments like they make me feel like shit. If she wasn’t into it she should have told me,her response was that she didn’t want to disappoint me and refuse sex. Told her if she wasn’t into it then we shouldn’t be having sex at all. This led to her saying that fighting leads to great makeup sex, and later that night nothing happened. 

It’s like she’s always waiting on me. I have to do all the work all the time. I have to put in the work to turn her on and everything else. 

She told me in the beginning that she doesn’t need lots of sex. 

We’ve talked about it. I told her that I needed to feel like she desired me sexually, but as in finding out, you absolutely cannot negotiate desire. Told her to initiate more. She apologized and said she would and that she doesn’t know why she’s like this, and thinks I’ll say no or something. I’ve told her I’ll never reject her. She initiated twice after our little conversation but never again. 

She says she’s attracted to me and will blow me pretty much whenever I ask. But I never feel like she’s into it. 

Wasn’t like this when we first started having sex. She would always ask me if I would get her off, was very into it when we would do it. We would make out for hours. She would cum when when she was on top. Not anymore. Not the case these days. It’s like duty sex for her. 

She also doesn’t get as wet as she used to. And she doesn’t even bother asking me to get her off anymore. She used to rub herself until she came while I banged her. Or ride me till she came. Not anymore. Sometimes I’ll ask her if she wants me to go down in her and she’ll say no or “if you want to”

It’s like she is not interested at all. She’d rather watch tv for 8 hours than make a move on me. 


I don’t know what to think. Is it responsive desire? Has she lost all attraction for me? If it makes any difference we’re both around each other 24/7 with the quarantine, both out of work, doing nothing. I can’t date her because nothing is open. I’m depressed. We just watched tv for 8 hours and she didn’t make any move at all. In fact she put her hand near my crotch accidentally and then pulled it away, kinda like “oops”. I can tell that she knows something is up tonight because I didn’t bother making a move on her tonight with anything. 

I am depressed because I kinda feel myself checking out. I don’t feel like she wants or desires me at all with this behavior. 


She feels like a friend or a roommate sometimes.  I think I am starting to lose attraction for her because she doesn’t moves on me and doesn’t really make an effort to turn me on. 

How am I expected to make a mode on her if I feel she doesn’t want it?

But if she’d watch 8 hours of Netflix then make a move on me, there’s not much I can do. 

Any thoughts ?"
"I ( 23F) let my long time friend (23F) move in with me while she was down on her luck. But now she isn't paying rent, and isn't doing housework. I feel like she's manipulating me. Are my thoughts valid or am I over reacting? TW: We both deal with CPTSD &amp; other anxiety disorders, COVID tests done Sorry in advance - This is a very long story that I'll try to make as short as possible.

I've known my friend for about 6 or 7 years now. We get along great, and we both come from similar abusive household /family dynamics, so we have always been good about proper communication and space/understanding what the other person needed. We originally planned to move in together when we were 18. At the time it didn't work out, and we both remained good friends but found separate living situations.

Now, a few years down the line, I've purchased my own house and a few months back I broke it off with my ex boyfriend, who at the time lived with me. 

She has been living with her parents the past year or two. As I said before, we both had bad childhood homes and she told me how miserable she felt being back in that situation. I figured that I needed someone else in the house to not feel so lonely, and I knew that she would be happy to have a place of her own and be away from the old abuse. She told me she had some money saved up.

Upfront, I told her I needed her to do her weight in house work. A trigger for my CPTSD is when I'm consistently forced to clean up after others - and my ex threw a tantrum and trashed the house during his 30 day notice. (I stayed with friends during that time) Instead of a deposit, we agreed she would help me clean up the mess my ex left behind. 

I also upfront told her how much bills are around average and when things were due, so she would know for the worst case scenario. She told me it wasn't a problem, that she had money saved up from living with her parents, and we moved on.

Before the pandemic, I was already frustrated with her lack of house work. Firstly, she didn't help me clean up after my ex at all. I would spent hours cleaning, and when I would ask for help she would be busy or she would invite guests over, so I felt uncomfortable being confrontational around them. For background, I normally work full time, and I'm also a full time student online. She is a nurse tech who is PNR, so on average she works 1-2 shifts a week. She is also going to school part time, taking 2 classes.

I brought my feelings up to her, calmly and using ""I feel"" statements rather than ""You are"". I told her I felt as though I was doing most of the house work, and asked if there are chores she prefers doing to others or if a schedule for chores would be easier for her. She told me to make a list of what needed to be done and to leave it on the fridge so she would know what I would like done at that time.

So I tried it. Nothing happened. Week after week I would cross out the chores I did, and week after week she would occasionally do a hand full of dishes, or take out the trash and that would be it. If I asked her to do something she would, but it's annoying to have to ask to do basic chores like cleaning up after she's done cooking. 

I started noticing that if I brought up cleaning, she would somehow gravitate the conversation into talking in great detail about past traumas. I, myself, am a fairly private person when it comes to my past and I don't really talk about it. But I know for others, it can help. I started out with being warm and understanding, being there to listen. But it got to a point where it brought my mental state down, and I started feeling uncomfortable asking her to do anything because I knew it would start a long, too detailed conversation where in the end I would end up comforting her and cleaning up after her anyway. 

The pandemic happened, and she worked for about a week before she had a low grade fever of 99° and she said she was having trouble breathing. Due to her work and the symptoms, she qualified to get a COVID-19 test. We quarantined completely, which was not great for either of our mental health but we knew was necessary.

She tested negative twice. The day she got the 2nd negative (or the day we were in theory allowed to leave the house to get groceries /necessities with a mask), she went to a separate hospital to get tested for a third time. She was very adamant that she had it, and claimed the nurses did the tests wrong. I was supportive, since I didn't want us to spread it if she did have it. I wanted her to feel heard and that her feelings and intuition mattered. That also came back negative, but we were forced to stay in quarantine even longer due to that. All in all, we stayed quarantined for about two weeks. 

After the third test came back negative, I finally got out of the house to go run a few errands. During this short period, she called me and told me she needed to go to the ER because she couldn't breathe. I drove her, and after they ran multiple tests (lung scans, CAT scans, blood work) they sent her home with no medication, due to all of her vitals being normal. To this day, she tells me she believes she had COVID and that every person tested her wrong. I'm less inclined to believe her, which makes me feel bad but is the truth. She never had a fever over 100.4°, she didn't ever test for flu or anything else, and at least around me she didn't have any trouble breathing. 

During this time, when I would go to sleep after caring for her all day (she wouldn't cook herself anything or even make herself a glass of water, I took care of her) she would post videos online and posts saying ""oh it's hard to breathe"", ""I feel horrible"", ""I have COVID-19"". She also took quite a few pictures while she was in the ER and still online claims she had COVID. It's annoying to be honest, but I never said anything because I don't like confrontation and it didn't seem like something that was my business.

The reason I mention all of this is during this time, she wasn't working. She doesn't get sick leave or any benefits being a PNR. A couple more weeks pass after she gets over her sickness, I notice she's hanging out with people and going into public but she still wasn't working. When I asked her about it, she said ""Oh I forgot to let my manager know that I don't have a fever anymore, I need to call them so they'll start scheduling me again"". She went over a month without working.

Two days before rent is due, she texts me saying ""I can't pay rent, I'll let you know when I can"". This isn't the first time she's been unable to pay me on the first, however she used to ask me if I would accept payment a couple of weeks later or she gave me some notice. It's been over a week, and she's given me $50 out of the hundreds she owes me. She still hasn't been working. And of course, I still have the list on the fridge of chores she hasn't touched. The straw that broke the camel's back is when I asked her to mow the lawn, since I've mowed it the past 2-3 times. She claimed it was too hot and she would wait until the next day, but it's been multiple days and no house work or mowing has been completed.

I know this post is long and confusing, and to be honest I'm very confused. 

I love her, and I care about her, but I feel like I have to baby her, which I don't really need right now. I feel like she's manipulating me into cleaning up after her and paying for her half of things. But at the same time, I don't want to misconstrue her behavior - I know she also has a lot to learn, and she is my friend. She's just not acting like one right now.

How do I talk to her without blowing up? I'm very frustrated, but I don't want to lose my cool or temper. I also don't like giving ultimatums, but is that what I need to do? Tell her to either do some damn house work or go back and live with her abusive parents? I also can't afford to pay for her rent for this month AND next. How do I tell her she needs to start working more, without coming across controlling? I want to be as kind and gentle as possible due to her mental health, and although this post is negative she does have a lot of positive things about her. I just don't know if I can get over these negative behaviors. 

I'm just at a loss and need guidance. Thank you all in advance, I hope everyone is staying safe."
"My (20F) boyfriend (23M) is a workaholic and Its starting to affect me. I dont know what to do. I made a throwaway acc because i don’t really use reddit to post but i decided to finally ask for some advice 

Ive known my boyfriend for 8 months and he was always a very hard working person. I really do respect that and appreciate that side of him. It differs very much from me ,I’m a student and freelance artist. I prioritize the time i spend doing thing i love and spending time with those i love .I see him usually once a week ,if I’m lucky i might see him twice. 
I have discussed with him how important i believe quality time and words of affirmation is in a healthy relationship (for me) and i do think he is trying. I ask if i can see him twice a week regularly but he always says maybe when work dies down. It usually never does or he gets a 2nd job . Every time we see each other he is usually tired and it makes me feel like I’m asking too much from him.
He is very money driven and isn’t very good at expressing his feelings using words. He’s the type to show that he loves me rather than tell me.
I’m beginning to wonder if quarantine is amplifying my anxieties or if this is going to be an ongoing problem? I just dont know what to do or how to get through to him"
"I [F16] am having trouble with my friend [M16] for dating my boyfriend [M19] throwaway account, on mobile, etc

I've been with my boyfriend since I was 14 and he was 18, we're 3½ years apart exactly, and because of the extra ½ year apart it is illegal for any sexual activity to happen. we of course don't want to get in trouble, so we've limited any physical sexual activity. I've been with him for a year and 3 months now, and I'm extremely happy, much happier than I was before he was in my life. 

Of course being young and stupid we messed up, sexted a bit, and my mom read texts and took away my phone and everything, but my mom isn't the problem in this story, so I'll move along. I was of course extremely upset, and wanted to vent to someone, so irl I told one of my friends, we'll call him Skyler, what had happened. He was quiet through the whole story until the end, where he asked me to clarify if I was talking about (my boyfriend), the senior. I said yes, and he called me disgusting, saying my boyfriend is a pedophile and should die etc. 

That was a while ago, and thus far I've just ignored anytime my boyfriend came up when talking with him, because when trying to talk about it in the past he would explode and tell me about how he wanted to chop off my boyfriend's dick and throw a cinder block through his head. I don't want to just stop being friends with him, he's been one of my good friends for a long time and I'm also a bit scared that he'll just tell everyone if I do that. I've tried to just talk to him about it telling him that we just love each other and we now do absolutely nothing illegal, as well at it being a literal 3½ year difference, he's not a pedophile. in one year it'll be completely legal for us to be together since that is the age of consent in my state. of course it didn't work, more death wishing, etc

he sent my boyfriend an Instagram post that was, I'll vaguely quote, ""repost if you want to kill all pedophiles."" he blocked him but then someone else sent him the same exact post. I asked Skyler about it and he denies any part in it, I've been ignoring it. any advise on how to proceed would be really nice,

TL;DR, my friend highly, highly dislikes my boyfriend mainly just because he's older than me, won't let it go."
"Am i (26F) crazy, or am I being manipulated?  Advice needed, but I mostly need to put it out there as I feel very alone right now. 

I am married. Tomorrow makes 1 year, 3 years total together. 

In the beginning, he was pretty great except for the fact he was still hung up on a emotionally abusive ex. 

I told him no more lies, no more secrets, and it was me or her. We were only 2 months in, and I cared for him but would cut my losses. 

He realized I was serious and cut off all communication and I have no reason to believe otherwise. 

After that we agreed to several things. 

Honestly

Open communication

Trust. 

We recently ran into a dead bedroom situation, where he was masturbating several times daily and we had no sex. 

I told him this bothered me. I felt unwanted and un satisfactory. He asked me what I wanted him to do, and I asked that we make love more often. He said he would stop masturbating and watching porn, because he felt it was killing his real world sex drive. I was happy he would make the effort, as the porn was what was affecting us so much. 


Sex did not change much, but I felt appreciated and listened too. 

Today, I asked to see his phone so I could look up our family eye physician. 

He willing handed it over, as we have an open phone policy. He tends to go through mine, and I never felt the need to look at his, especially without asking first.

As WE were scrolling through his search history, I saw lots and lots of porn. 

Edit to add: we went with an affordable eye care physician because we have no health insurance. I didn't know the name of the place and he didn't remember, but knew he Googled it recently and would be able to find it that way. 

Which is fine. Its porn. Whatever right? 

What hurts me here, was being lied too. 

Did he just tell me he stopped because he wanted me to not be upset? 

I asked him why it would show up if he was being honest with me, because he denied it. With proof right there ...

He said it may have been from ads he clicked on, or from past tabs he had open because he had ""over 300"" and decided to close them all. 

I then asked him, why all the time stamps were convinently when I was out of the house, asleep, or he was in the bathroom. 

He said he didn't know, but I hurt him because I didn't trust him or take his word over what I was looking at right in front of me. 

He asked me if I think he is some 14 year old jacking off in the Walmart bathroom, because there were times for that too. 

He yelled at me and said I have hurt his pride. And I said sorry. 

I didn't go looking for this, I even told him agreeing to stop was just to make me be quiet, then I wouldn't be mad if he just came clean right there. He offered to stop in the first place. I did not ask him to, but rather a accepted his offer because he was making an effort to improve our sex life. 

I didn't yell or demean him. I just wanted answers, and all I got was ""I don't know"" and I feel like I can't combat the topic anymore because he gets so angry with me. 

I asked him to see it from my side. If I had promised not to look at photos of huge cocks and other men, and he finds all this proof and I say ""nope, don't know how that got there!!"" 

He still denies it, and says he has no idea how it got there and I need to stop acting like I don't believe him. 

He have me a long lecture and for some reason, I ended up apologizing to him. 

Now I don't know how to feel. 

I'm not upset about the porn anymore.

I'm upset he lied to me. Possibly when I asked him to stop. And unless there is some weird way it just showed up, he lied to me right there in my face about it. 

And I don't accept lies. I would rather hear the truth. And we have had some real hard conversations in the past because of it. And even though the Truth hurt at the time, I still am happy that I wasn't lied to. 

Until now? Maybe? 

Am I being deceived? 

Or is he being honest? 

Are my feelings not worth stopping? 

How can I prove I've been lied to, if the only thing I haven't done is catch him in the act? 

He has bragged in the past about the way he can manipulate people. And I have seen him lie right to other people's faces about small things. 

Where he was born.

His college degree.

Things to make him more interesting.

I thought since I knew the truth about those things, he was honest with me in general. 

He has come clean before about much worse things, like when he was speaking with people from his past who had sexual motivations. 

When he went and got coffee with his ex.

I've let the argument go. And now he is being extra kind, asking if I still love him, and so on. 

He has a deep fear of being abandoned and feared I would leave him when he spoke with his ex for example. 

But with this, I feel crazy. Like I was deceived. And there's no budging, it's simply I'm wrong and he is right. 

I feel lost right now. We are getting along again, but I feel this weight on my soul like things are different. I can't tell if I'm crazy, or if he just wants me to think that.

Maybe I am just bat shit and need to let it go. Or maybe I need to be heavily medicated. I am very confused, and I have no one else. I normally talk to him about my feelings and what bothers me, but with this I can't. He just shuts me down."
"Virgin in crisis I was on tinder and I matched with this girl. Hella cute, like definitely out of my league type of stuff. And like we hit it off pretty good we was vibeing. This continued into like a month long relationships/friendships. Were talked about like dating and going on dates quite often. (But corona time) Then like a month in She had started to get somewhat distant, and like we talked daily. Like 15+ snapchats a day, but then  she started to reply once a day, and didn’t keep the conversation. This alongside with some of my “depression” made me kinda ghost her. 

It’s two weeks after and I find me thinking of her everyone and a while. I’ve been fighting the urge to message her. But I think I really do what to talk the her again. But would she even like... want to think of dating me again. Or have I lost that privilege? &amp;&amp;&amp; would it be wrong of me to even message her?

Also she hardly ever posted on Snapchat when we where talking, maybe once or twice, and when I stoped talking to her she started to post more frequently. And each post since has cleavage. And idk if she’s seducing me or what."
"My suicidal best friend of 13 years sexually assaulted two women Uh, throwaway account because I have some friends who know the situation who follow me on reddit. This is kind of long but I appreciate anybody who takes the time to read the whole thing.

About a year ago now, I heard a rumor from one of my classmates regarding one of my best friends (let’s call him Joe) at the time, saying that he had been making girls uncomfortable on more than one occasion.

After looking into this and asking one of the girls involved (who he had apparently been in separate relationships with at the time of each respective incident) I found out that he had locked the first girlfriend in his car and refused to let her out until she kissed him. She broke up with him shortly afterwards (for obvious reasons), and started dating girl two. At some point, I’m told that he pulled her down on his lap and wouldn’t let her go even when she was telling him to stop over and over again. This was all told to me by girl number two, who provided text receipts after the fact of her talking to Joe in which he suggested that “next time something happens, she say ‘Pineapple’” as if “Stop” was not clear enough. 

This hit me very hard. I had known Joe to be a fairly reserved kid with a bit of an anger issue that had been steadily improving over the time that I knew him. We had been friends since elementary school, and though we had been drifting apart, we still met up frequently through hang-out sessions with our friend group. As a group, we had known about his first girlfriend and subsequent break-up which he had described as “completely unexpected”. In retrospect, this and the ‘Pineapple’ comment make it seem as if he’s completely oblivious to how his actions weren’t acceptable.

To me, this felt completely out of character for him, but was also something that there seemed to be too much evidence for to deny (I’m not in the habit of assuming victims are lying, and the text receipts seemed to at least indicate that there had been some major incident which he acknowledged happening). 

Since then, I’ll admit I haven’t reacted well. I essentially cut off contact with Joe completely and told the rest of the friends in our group about it. All but one also couldn’t continue to be friends with Joe after the fact and so far as I know, have had limited contact at best with him without addressing the subject. The one who did try to reach out to him about it was ignored but now has a casual (albeit distant) relationship with him to this day. 

I later found out that during that period and assumably afterwards as well, Joe has been suicidal and extremely depressed. Apparently, the girl who I had talked to about the whole situation had had to stop him from cutting himself on multiple occasions. Almost a year later, I still have no idea how to feel about any of this. 

It’s obvious to me that I’ve fucked up in several ways throughout this whole thing. I failed as a friend by not noticing that he was depressed and needed help at the time, even though I’ve dealt with other friends going through similar things. I failed by not being someone that he felt he could talk to about it. I failed by not confronting him, and instead cutting contact without warning. I failed by letting a year pass before I’m attempting to resolve this. All of these are things I did terribly because of my own difficulty wrapping my head around the situation and are things that I’ve sworn to improve on I’m the future. 

As of right now, I don’t know. I’m still upset with him for blatantly violating the boundaries of people he supposedly cared about not once but twice, and seemingly being unable to identify why it’s a problem. I know I’m not the victim here in any sense of the word, but I can’t help but feel betrayed, like he was never the person I thought I was friends with. 

I’m looking for guidance, and maybe some opinions as well, thought I’m not one to take the word of internet strangers as the ultimate truth. Do I reach out a year later? Does depression and mental illness affect/explain his behaviors? Am I right to move on with my life? Should I check in? I think I could probably live the rest of my life leaving things as they are, but I also can’t say this has been properly resolved."
"Soon to be ex husband [M31] dumped the dinner I made [F28] in the trash. Called me a a wh*re. So I left my husband a few days ago. Today he begged me to talk. I didn't want him to come over because I have two abscess teeth but I agreed to get it over with. I made dinner so we could talk. I made dinner kinda early because I was anxious. Like a little after 3. He said he was coming over at 5. When he arrived he was really mad about this. He always wanted his food fresh and when I timed it wrong and made it too early or too late he would get really mad. He kept insulting the food then stood over the trash can and told me ""keep your fucking eyes on mine"" as he trashed my food. Then he started screaming at me and called me a ""busted wh\*re"". My roommate Tony made him leave. My question is would it be a over reaction to get a restraining order over this?"
"My (22m), GF(21F) just punched a girl for talking to me at a bar and now she might be going to jail and I need advice on what to say/do now. First off, my gf has actual experience fighting MMA and whatnot so I knew she had the skills to do this but never thought she would whip it out for no reason. We were at a bar with a small group and this girl came up to talk to me specifically. I admit it was really cringe and weird of her when she saw how I was already talking and next to a girl but apparently it was an unforgivable offense for my drunk af gf who just punched her in the stomach which made the girl go down on her knees wheezing. The bouncer came up and before my gf could start something with a 6'5"" dude I knew she would lose we just hightailed it back to my apt where she is now passed out for the last 11 hours or so.

My first thought was that she must really like me, but then I came to my senses and realized she just decked an admittedly rude girl for no reason. There isn't much height or weight difference between us and what if one day she does the same to me? But honestly with how absolutely hammered she was IDK if it's the real her. Also we have not heard anything from the police and my friends told me the girl just left the bar with some of her own party so who knows how that turns out. What should I say to her when she wakes up?"
"I (32M) think my family is guilt tripping me I've lived in a small town I don't like for 16 years. It's a long story as to how I got here, but needless to say I feel like I just don't fit in. It's too small of a town for my comfort. My family and I moved here when I was 16 for my dad's work. I can honestly say that for half of my life nothing good has happened to me. Even my family would, and has, agreed to that. No serious girlfriends, no big job opportunities, nothing that would make me want to put down any roots here. Yet, for some reason, they don't want me to leave.

My dad died from cancer a few years ago. I have two younger sisters who are married with kids. My mom also lives here. Whenever I say I want to move away, they support me at first, but then after awhile seemingly guilt trip me into staying. They say things like ""your nephews need a strong male role model"", and ""we want you to do what you want to do, but we don't want you to leave"".

It's obvious to them I'm not happy, it can't not be. So how do I break this cycle of being complacent for the sake of them? Aren't I entitled to live my life however and wherever I want?"
"As a 17m, could I get myself or others in trouble by going after an older woman? There is this older lady, in her later 30's or 40's who's apparently been staying in my neighbourhood for a while. She works with my sister and has been over a few times, but I've never seen her until recently and thought she was new in the area. Despite being older she is stunning, and she's always wearing these ridiculously short dresses. It's nearing winter here where I live but she still wears short dresses a lot, and her legs are smoking hot. A chick that can wear short skirts even in cold weather has always been a ""type"" of mine.

We've spoken a few times when she's been over, but briefly. My sister didn't bother introducing us(thanks, sis), but she's usually friendly and my sister let it slip once that she was single. Now I know she most likely wouldnt date me considering our age difference, and its not lke I'm mature for age or anything either. And yeah, there might be a legal barrier as well. Even if it never happens, will I get her or both of us into trouble by at least telling her how I feel and leaving it at that? It will give me peace of mind if she knows how I feel about her. It just feels like I'm being fake by pretending I only see her as my platonic neighbour, and if I continue just make polite conversation with her, that's what I'd be doing. This also isn't just some random crush. I know there are girls my own age, but I really am extremely attracted to her. Not just her looks, but her fashion."
I think alot of my husband friend because of a dream.. Me and mu husband are together since 10 years and everything is great between us. He have this attractive childhood friend that is staying at us atm because of covid19. He’s funny and respectful and everything and I never thought about him something more than a friend. Except that since 1 week and I keep dreaming about him and having sex and those stuff and I can’t stop thinking about those dreams and I don’t know why I’m still dreaming about them. I love my husband and I will never find someone like him and don’t want to break my relation with him because my stupid brain having those dreams. What should I do? I don’t even know why I care about them but I have this weird feeling.
"What Am I Doing Wrong? So, I met this gentleman about 10 months ago, after he messaged me online first. We hungout several times afterwards and nothing sexual happened. Though, after a few months, it inevitably became more intimate. He did things that were not just friendly, like take me out to nice restaurants, the movies, basically a date. After a while, he just seemed more coldhearted. Fast forward to today, the watch I purchased for him came in the mail today. I then asked him if he could come over so he can see his gift, but he said he had plans. His plans are to spend the night in an Airbnb with his buddies and female friends of theirs. He tried to just convey it as a mission to find his friend a girl to be with, but it seemed very forced. I then asked if he would be having casual sex with any of those women because I refuse to share someone. Out of human decency, respect... I thought it was a valid question. Why not answer if it's your activity? Why are you shameful? I only felt comfortable asking this because he has stated several times that he would not want to be intimate if I were to get with another male. Obviously, I would never speak or sleep with multiple men at the same time, as that is just not acceptable to me. Anyway, he stuck with ""No, I'm just going to be kicking it"". Which just doesn't sit right with me. Am I in the wrong? I've always been loyal, even if we aren't exclusive or official. He just seems to be using me at his own disposal. It is something I don't understand about myself. Why am I pursuing someone who clearly doesn't align with my moral code? He is a very sweet guy. I really enjoy talking to him, but I don't know what to do. Why is he even keeping me around? My bodacious body? The fact that I don't sleep around? Does he feel better about himself that I'm somewhat 'pure'? I don't know. But also, what do I do with the watch? Give it to him? Man. Fuck my life. Well, I would enjoy anyone's opinion. Rude, mean, I'm here for it all. I have no one else to ask.


I just want a man who is pure and good hearted. Why do I attract these slimy dreads of society?"
"Dogs in bed 
Ok, so this is my first time on reddit looking for advice. I’m in a relationship of about 5 months. My bulldog is 2 years old. He goes to work with me, stores, etc. We do everything together. He’s my ESA dog and I got him after an almost fatal car accident/really abusive relationship. I’m not denying that our attachment is a little extreme, but he makes me feel safe and happy. I couldn’t imagine not sleeping with him at night. My significant other does not want him sleeping in the bed though. My dog will cry for me, and honestly, I feel hurt without him there. I don’t see why my boyfriend won’t just say ok knowing it gives me peace. I’m not sure what to do, any advice or thoughts, I’d love to hear."
"I (25M) am considering breaking up with my girlfriend(22F) but am worried I'm not in a good emotional state to make that decision. The past year or so have been tough (emotionally).   


I bought a new house, lost a close friend to cancer, developed a panic disorder (which seems to be mostly under control) and just this week both got a puppy and had to euthanize said puppy due to a virus he got from the breeder --&gt; Hence the compromised emotional state.   


My gf and I have been dating for several years - going on 3 to be exact - and we've had our problems but lately I feel that she relies on me to be her energy/motivation and I can't supply that energy to both of us. Moreover, I feel like we've increasingly found that we have little to nothing in common-especially hobby-wise. I like videogames, hiking, fishing, camping, boardgames and debating. She likes gossiping, shopping, house-hunting, working, museums, arts and going to restaurants. We also just don't interact with people the same way. I love people and she kind of hates interacting with people. Due to these difference we don't really have anywhere we both want to live and we're just kind of putting of the inevitable problem of ""what next?"". And the last straw has been, she pointed out we haven't been having sex as much as before and she felt I wasn't as attracted to her anymore. I told her that wasn't the case but I'm afraid she might be right. 

So I think on paper it makes sense to break up... but I have fears. I'm not the best looking guy in the world. not terrible (probably) but not great. 

So there's the fear of not finding someone again. And I love being in a couple so that would be crushing. 

I'm afraid I would be making an irrational decision that I would regret. I tend to change my mind often. Not that I'm indecisive but I'm a scientist and as you learn new things you admit you were wrong and change your stance. 

and I'm afraid of hurting her. Despite it all, I do care for her and I know she'll be an absolute mess... It's heartbreaking to think of how one day someone tells you they love you and the next they don't want to be with you anymore.

So I don't know what to do. I have had to make some tough choices recently and this would certainly be yet another difficult one. Thoughts?"
"Husband flirting online My husband of 11 years (29 yo) has always been a really big internet ""flirt"". Sending and receiving pics, talking to other woman. 

Lately he's been reacting with the flame emoji (🔥 not sure if it's going to show up here) on the stories to many different woman's pictures. Most of these women he had went to high school with and it bothers me more that they aren't just strangers. 

Should I make a big deal over this? I feel like it is disrespectful and it hurts my feelings, however, I don't want to put too much control into his life. He is an amazing husband and father otherwise so its hard to know whether to fight this battle or just let it go. 

Any men that do what my husband is doing have any input? Thank you guys!"
"How do you guys deal with insecurities in a relationship?? Hi guys. So this is probably going to be a long one so bare with me. 
I’ve (F23) been with my bf (M23) for well over a year and a half now. We’ve had our ups and downs and have been living together for months now. 
I have continuously been dealing with sudden random I guess you can call them “flashbacks”, throughout my days where I remember his ex or some girl he told me about he previously went on a date with.
At first I obviously didn’t care but as time went on I found myself constantly thinking about them, and I guess the life he had with his ex or those moments he had with random girls. Just basically his life before me. 
He’s never given me a reason to not trust him. However it has gotten so bad to the point where I literally get tense, feel like I’m going to vomit, if / when a convo about his ex gets brought up. Now normally she’s brought up with good reason, for instance “my buddy is dealing with this with his girl I remember when my ex would do stuff like that blah blah blah”. 
I get it’s somewhat normal to feel “insecure” about your significant other’s past hookups/ relationships but I don’t think to the extent of mine. I feel like it’s somewhat taken a dramatic toll on my life I constantly think about it to the point where I make myself anxious, sweaty, shaky, etc. 
my boyfriend doesn’t know about these little “panic attacks” I have. 
Honestly the intense anxiety / overthinking has become pretty FREQUENT especially with me being at home more with nothing to do due to covid-19. I basically have all the time in the world to hinder and imagine and think about his past.
I guess I feel insecure because I compare myself to these girls all the damn time. But he’s made it known I have nothing to worry about and he’s always been crazy about me and they don’t matter at all.  We have had many talks about my insecurities but I’ve never expressed to him that I feel SO NEGATIVE about it, FREQUENTLY. More frequently than I’d like to admit to him, or anyone. 
I feel like it puts me in random bad moods, it makes me feel super insecure at random points of the day, makes me want to shut down, makes me not want to be happy. I do realize I am in control of my own thoughts and I have the ability to snap out of it but... I just think this type of overthinking/anxiety/ insecurity I’ve put on myself has become a bit too overwhelming for me to handle. I feel at times at least several times a week that I want to seek out help to get my mind/ thoughts straight but I’m unsure. 
Do you guys think I might need to see a therapist? 
All comments are welcome!"
"Ex (22F) of 2.5 years Ended it via Text with me(24M), 3 weeks new man, How can i be happy for her? I made a similar post in another subreddit for those who want to see the backstory..I am really hurt obviously given the circumstances of her breaking up with me via text while i was at work. I tried my best to make it work, she told me I was doing great. But apparently it was ""too late"" for her, my strides to improve the relationship failed. Within 3 weeks I contacted her to try and talk in person but she denied based off of ""personal reasons"". I accepted that. We chatted, I asked some questions where I honestly didn't get full answers but partial ones. She made it obvious she wasn't about me anymore. She later told me in the conversation she was with a new guy and was going to see him that night when i texted her at 10pm at night. We all know what happens that late...I let it be and she told me maybe in the future their is a chance for us just not right now. 

Well i caved in a week later (today) from that conversation that night and asked how she was doing and said I hope their is a chance for us in the future, she told me ""their is no chance for us, I'm sorry but you need to move on."" It sucks but its the truth I suppose. I want to be happy for her because who doesn't deserve happiness? Although i don't feel that way because of course I want her to be happy with me..I cant force it but I just don't understand how she could move on so fast and just forget me that quick? 

TLDR: Not sure how to feel with her finding a new man so quick and her talking to me like I am a burden. I want to be happy for her but I don't. How can I forget all of this so I can move on myself? I feel so betrayed and destroyed."
"Should I break up with my girlfriend because I hate myself and think she deserves better? Im thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend.. my head is a bit fucked up and I have major self-love issues and I don’t think it’s fair for my girlfriend to deal with my nonsense and bullshit when she deserves a lot better.

Ive tried to breakup w her before because I think she doesnt deserve to have to deal with my bullshit but it ends up bad because were just really whipped for each other, I love her so much. She always tells me shes here for me but that builds on the guilt that I feel like she could do so much better..

am i being selfish? what do i do.."
"Forming a deeper emotional connection I’ve been dating this girl for about 5 months and I like her we have a good time together but we haven’t really formed much of an emotional connection. I want to have a deeper relationship and I would like to at Least try and have that with her. What are some ways we can form that. I opened up to her last night about wanting to take our relationship further because it’s pretty surface level right now, she agreed, but we haven’t talked about it since."
"My boyfriend is my only friend. Before this whole virus situation, I (20F) had a few good friends. Then once this started, I just kinda lost all my friends. My most best friend ever (21F) moved away and we’ve grown apart. My ex-best friend (23M) is a male and we had a falling out recently. My only friend being my boyfriend  (20M) isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but I do feel like I need someone else to talk to and hang out with. Idk what to do. Oh &amp; I have my work friends which are great but I need people outside of work as well. This is also my first long relationship, is this just how it goes when it comes to friendships? Idk I’m all over the place sry lol"
"My boyfriend lied about how serious his previous relationship was  I'm 26, my boyfriend is 29, we've been together for 1.5 years, he introduced me to his parents early on and it is serious… we plan to get married. We are LDR but manage to see each other once every week. 

We spoke about past relationships the other day... he told me he had one that lasted 3.5 years through uni up until they graduated (aged 18-22). And so he was single for 5-6 years before he met me... I think mostly because he hasn't been ready to settle down until recently so he wanted to take his time. When I questioned him about whether it was serious, he told me it wasn’t – that they were childish and fooled around a lot as it was uni... he had a lot of fun at uni, and had gone from a sheltered upbringing to his first taste of freedom. He hid the relationship from his parents up until the end, as they are strict. I struggled to believe him, so I told him that it’s impossible to spend time in a 3.5 year relationship without some degree of seriousness… he said ‘You weren’t there, you didn’t know me then. You don’t know anything about it. It means nothing. It wasn’t serious’. I asked him if he wanted to marry her… he said ‘no lol’. 

I find the marriage part odd considering they would've spent a heap of time together, he is a genuinely good guy, and I've seen tagged pictures of them online where they're out drinking with friends and they do look happy. Also I get that he used to be very immature and that they messed around, but it's important to have fun in a relationship and surely something must have worked for them to have been together for that long. I can't imagine my boyfriend 'fooling around' as he is a decent guy. He has told me that he's never felt the way he does about me about anyone before, and that he's always seen me as his future... but then during a recent argument (where I was questioning our future) he told me he'd never waste so much time with me if he didn't. So he must've seen a future with her considering 3.5 years, in terms of emotional investment, is a significant time although it could've also been a thing of convenience as he didn't exactly have to put a huge amount of effort in to seeing her every day etc, where he does with me. When I asked him why they broke up he said it had ran it’s course. I also think they stayed friends and hung out together in their friendship group after the break up, so I’m assuming the break up was mutual. 

I've seen a lot of tagged photos of them on social media (those uploaded by their friend). A lot of these are taken in clubs/ bars, where she is on his lap and they're cuddling and happy. There's a few where he's looking deep in to her eyes (but he also looks drunk). I've seen videos of them doing pranks on each other and friends, and seen a comment by him on a photo of his ex saying 'she was farting so much in my bed last night I had to spray her ass'. This upset me as I think about how often they must've shared a bed within their time together. Once I brought this up with him and he told me to stop being silly, that I'm 'the one' and we have the rest of our lives together for that. His ex also used to make a lot of jokey comments on pictures of him. My boyfriend also used to post comments like 'can't wait for the next f\*ckin sesh, so hyped' etc etc. His ex was/is very much a party girl too. Whereas now he hardly ever drinks and is very sensible in general…he likes that I hardly drink too. Still though, I have images in my head of them being in bed together and making serious plans for the future, talking about how they’re going to get married and have children etc, in the same way that he does with me. We also sometimes don’t have an awful lot to talk about, but then I think they must’ve always been talking together as they would’ve had so much in common. Also, sometimes when he says really lovely things to me I wonder if he ever said the same things to her. Am I crazy for thinking like this? It’s weird because when I first saw these pictures and comments, I shrugged it off thinking it was such a long time ago anyway, and that she would’ve had him when he had little life experience and money so I have the better deal. But now my thinking has completely changed.

Just wondering how a relationship lasting so long can be non serious? Especially as it was their first and presumably would've been in each other's pockets (same course, same friends etc). Whilst I do believe that it’s more about quality over quantity, if it only lasted a year I wouldn’t be thinking this much in to it, but over three years is a LONG time…something must have gone right for them and he wouldn’t have invested so much time if he didn’t see a future, right? They lost their virginities to one another – surely this makes it serious enough? Before he introduced me to his parents he made a point of telling me he's never done anything serious like that with a girl before. But then I see the pictures of them and they look extremely happy. Part of me really, really wants to believe him (especially for my own sanity) but then I do feel like he has lied to just keep me happy and shut me up. I’ve read threads online and the majority of people do tend to say their young relationships still counted as serious, and that at the time they felt they were ‘the one’. My boyfriend is outright denying this, despite the fact that they spent all their time together. So I find him hard to believe.

Does it sound like he is telling the truth?"
"When do I tell him...? I have HSV1 genital. 

I’ve been talking to this gentleman who’s currently in another state. 

Because he wanted to come out to the beach anyway, he was offering to come see me. But I also offered to go out to see him because I don’t want him to put effort to see me and be disappointed and feel like he wasted his time.

When the heck do I tell him I have virus? 
I’ve failed few times for telling people too early. 

But what does “waiting for the right moment” do?
Isn’t that just wasting of time for the other person? 
I mean yes, we get along very well and we feel like we can keep taking forever. We have a lot of things in common.

I do want him to know me better before I tell him, but at the same time, I don’t want to disappoint us. 

Of course everybody would say “oh gosh no” if they don’t know the person well enough to even want to see how things go. But don’t I have the right to show what kind of person I am? Why should I be judged by the selfish man’s action in the past?

Do I still wait to tell him till we see each other?

That’s what I want to do. But how would you guys think if you guys were him?"
"Would it be weird if I [M18] asked this girl [F18] that i have only texted with a few times out on a date? Title basically says it all. There’s this girl going to the same college as me next year and lives 20 mins away that I have texted with a few times and vibed with when we have texted, so would it be weird if I just straight up asked her out on a date? Or do you recommend hanging as friends first and then go from there? Thanks!"
"Me (26M) and my Girlfriend (26F) never have sex because she is not in the mood Title says it all. We are in a relationship for 7 years now and for the last couple of years my GF doesn't wanna have sex anymore.  We used to have sex a lot in the early years , but it declined when we moved in with each other. We live together for 3 years now and I am happy if we do it once or twice per month.

We also never had penetration, we tried it a couple of times but she said it hurts to much and doesn't wanna try it anymore because of the pain. I think this is the main reason why she doesn't like it anymore, and I am in some desperate need of help."
"How do I get my boyfriend to contribute? I (29f) and my partner (31m) have been living together for a few years and moved accrosd the state away from our families for a job he accepted. 

It took me a week to find a job, but while I was looking he expected me to unpack, clean and cook everything - understsndable, I wasn't working.  I then got a job and the cleaning was split but I doubt the expenses were.  I would buy everything for a meal that would usually last me a week (so I expected some leftovers) but it was gone in a night but he would buy cheaper meals like pastas. If he did a bjg food shop he would flaunt it and say what he spent, I would have spent a bit throughout the week and say nothing though because I thought it shouldn't be a big deal.   I would buy all cleaning stuff too. So I never thought it was split.  He earned more than me but I didn't care. 

I have not long changed jobs and now earn significantly more, and significantly more than he does.  That's a point of contention.

We're now in lockdown together and his work has not stopped but it has halfed.   My work however has remained as as steady as ever with no signs of it slowing down, in fact it's actually getting busier.  I'm also working 100% from home. 

I have been ok with doing the cooking and cleaning but I'm still doing half and don't think I should be when he initally wanted me to do everything when I wasn't working.   This morning was also my pne sleep in and he kept trying to wake me up so I could do the dishes.  

It's not that I don't want to do any domestic duties, but I feel like with him being home more, he should pick up some extra chores.  I told him that I was thinking about this and he cracked it.  Now I'm concerned he will spend more time at his office to simply avoid doing extra chores simply because he can actually do that. 

Do I continue to push for this?"
"My son and step daughter fight constantly and I don't know if this is a normal sibling issue or a blended family issue So me and my ex-wife split when our son was around 4 and my current wife split with her husband when her daughter was around 3ish. We met when the kids were 5 and 4, her daughter spends some time at her dads but her mom has primary custody of her just like I have primary custody of my son. We didn't move in together till our kids were 7 and 6, while at the time they both liked it. When the kids were 8 and 7, me and my wife got married and we all moved in together.

The kids like both of us, and I haven't heard either of them call either of us step mom or step dad, but I don't think either liked the idea of having a sibling. They bicker and fight constantly, over food, games, TV, toys, and everything.

Me and my wife both have siblings who are much older than us so we never really dealt with sibling rivalry (even if this is what it is) so we don't know the dynamic or ""not wanting a sibling"" cause ours were always older and more warm to us.

Is this normal for blended families?

TL;DR:My son and step daughter fight constantly and I don't know if this is normal or a blended family issue, the fights aren't anything serious but over stuff like food, toys, TV, and practically everything.  I also don't think they think to fondly of the other.  "
"I (26F) rarely get angry, but my bf (28M) gets mad all the time, and I don't know how to handle it My bf and I are together for a year and a half now. When we're not fighting everything is wonderful, and my mom adores him, but he just gets mad so frequently that I don't know what to do. 

Before my bf, I almost never argued with people. My dad would get angry with me every once in a while during puberty, but that's about it. On the one hand, I have a tendency to avoid conflict, but on the other hand, when someone has truly crossed a line, I can always explain myself calmly. However, this is quite different with my bf.

I'd estimate that we have a fight about once every week/two weeks when times are good, and more than three times per week to daily when we're in a rough patch. I don't know if there is a ""normal"" amount of arguing, but since I had never ever fought in my previous relationship (which is also not good, since he did some stuff we should've argued about), it seems like sooo much to me. Our fights almost always start in the same way. He isn't feeling well (tired, back pain, stressed, you name it), and because he's uncomfortable, he starts sneering at me. I usually ignore it for a bit, but I already know it will go wrong. Something I'll say or do will rub him the wrong way and he'll get angry (it can be something as small as being out of peanut butter). I tried pointing it out to him, but then he'll just get angry at that. 

When we're in a fight, he is mad and I get overwhelmingly sad. I just feel hurt and heartbroken, and what everything to be okay again. He needs some time to wind down in a different room, but him stumping away when I'm crying on the couch makes me feel incredibly lonely. I always want to talk things over but he says he's not really capable of that at that moment and needs time on his own.

This is where I frequently go wrong. I just want everything to be okay again so desperately, that I end up going to him and apologizing most of the time. I'm trying to stop doing this, but it can be hard since sometimes it takes him about two hours to get back to me. If I'm the one in the living room, I start to just watch TV or do some chores to distract myself. I'm getting better at it.

I want to talk things over but he doesn't necessarily. ""We'll never agree on this,"" he'll say, but I don't necessarily have to agree. I just want him to understand what my point of view was. I feel like we're not making progress on the issues we're fighting about because the talking it over is usually limited. I try to say my stuff, but frequently notice he's becoming irritated again, and I stop before it gets too bad. For me, ideally, the talking over is just both saying something like: ""I noticed this and that rubbed you the wrong way, now I know, I will take it into account in the future"". I feel like we're not making any ""progress"" in the fights because we end up having the same arguments again because we do not really talk them over. I understand that talking over may not be everyone's cup of tea, so it's not really a requirement but I think it'd help so much to do it properly. 

We've talked about the fighting and how it bothers me frequently. I asked how his previous girlfriends handled it. He said they didn't bother that much and just yelled back. I tried but it was horrible and I got even more sad and started hyperventilating and I think it's just not for me to yell at someone. His mom currently is spoiling him like he's a kid so I can imagine her not really standing up to it. But I'm contributing to the problem as well by giving in. I tried to tell him many times that I think he gets angry too quickly and too often, but he just doesn't buy it. He just shrugs it off.

He has shown a learning curve. He stopped smoking marijuana (for different reasons), which helped a lot. He also pays more attention to his eating habits which helped because sometimes he was just hangry. Both of those things happened in the first year we were together. For the last half a year, things feel like they are the same. 

I just don't know what to do. I love him and enjoy the all not-fighting time together and I wouldn't mind fighting every once in a while. It's currently just too much for me. If he would show understanding or that he'd actually try to improve, I think that'd feel better for me. But I'm not sure if I can ask for that. I normally would not want to change my bf but it's just that it hurts so much.

How do you guys think I can improve my behavior to better adapt to the situation? Can we try to argue less or should I just accept that it's in his nature and find better ways to deal with it? Or is it more normal to fight frequently but am I just very sensitive? Can I expect something from him?

Thank you for reading guys.

TL;DR: My bf and I frequently have arguments and I just cry and stuff, and I don't know how to deal with all those fights."
"I am bored in my relationship but I still love my boyfriend My boyfriend (M19) and I (F19) have been dating for a few months over a year now. It is both of ours first real relationships and I truly do love him. But these past few months I’ve felt myself becoming a bit.. bored to put it simply. We never do anything except sit at his house and I watch him play video games or we go fishing, which I do not enjoy. 

I don’t have a problem doing the things he enjoys as long as we get to do things I like too. I get that we are young and don’t always have the funds or availability to go out and do exciting things but even when the opportunity arises he would still choose to stay home while I go out with our friends. I’ve accepted that we would have to wait until we are more settled in like to make plans together to have fun. 

Not to mention that our sex life doesn’t excite me anymore. Full disclosure, he took my virginity, so I probably had some high expectations going in. Now a year in though I try to suggest new things to try and everything gets shot down. Even just simple hair pulling is a no. I can imagine this might be because I’m only the second girl he has been so he’s probably insecure about not knowing how to do things the “right way” but I feel like a year into our relationship we would be comfortable enough to try new things.

The problem is that recently I’ve been catching myself with a “single mindset”. My friends will be talking about their tinder matches and I’ll have the thought, ‘that would be fun to make a tinder and talk to some guys’ before I get a chance to remind myself that I am in a relationship. I’m loyal, don’t get me wrong, I think I’m just missing out on the excitement. 

I almost wish that we had met in a few years when we have a better idea of who we are as people. Realistically I know the statistics of staying with your first significant other for forever are low and it doesn’t bother me. I can accept that we need to get heartbroken to build us as people. I don’t want to break up because I do love him but I almost wish we could hit pause with no hard feelings and come back in a few years. 

I’m not sure what I’m asking for advise-wise. Maybe just some wisdom from relationships when you were my age or similar situations. 

:/ 

TL;DR
I’m bored with my relationship but I don’t want to end it. All of my efforts to excite things are shot down and completely 1 sided."
"I (23f) feel like my mom (41f) deserves a better daughter Today I asked my sister if her boyfriend was coming to the brunch my mom didn’t tell me about. My mom yelled at me earlier is week and said “I’m just gonna cancel on Sunday  I don’t want V here and you having an attitude” let’s say V is my sisters boyfriend. I usually have gotten along with her boyfriends but not the last few as she has snuck them around and the last one was a drug dealer. She always made them come to plans we had as a family last minute and I would leave to avoid not having a good time and making the mood go down. It’s my own fault I know but I missed out on birthdays, concerts and Father’s Day last year for a boyfriend she hates now and is living with someone completely new. 

My mom and sister have been fighting the majority of this year. I got laid off because of COVID and have bipolar depression. I’m unemployed, my car transmission failed so I have no car, and I am being held back in junior college yet another semester. I could have had my A.A. by this spring and have applied to work as a counselor especially during a time like this but I don’t have my credentials just yet. It’s frustrating and my depression is coming back. This week was really bad and my mom and I fought but then were able to talk it out and come up with a plan so that I’m more productive (I didn’t help much this week and slept until noon because I wouldn’t be able to stay asleep) and I know it’s stressing my mom. Since her and my sister have been fighting my mom has gotten closer to me. While this is happening she is also divorcing her husband. My sister and her husband conspire against me and claim I want my mom to myself so I push everyone away. 

Back to today....I sent my sister that question wondering if he would be here and said last Father’s Day was ruined because she brought her boyfriend she isn’t with and I am just learning about it so want to make sure it’s immediate family. She said he’s coming and that she doesn’t want to fight. She also said “Fine keep mom to yourself” 
I let her know I wasn’t trying to fight and just stated what happened last year- I understand they shouldn’t have to walk on eggshells for me but if my mom knows I don’t like her boyfriend and sets me up by not letting me know he is coming to my home where I’m stuck for quarantine and cannot drive anywhere- it feels like they set me up for failure. I texted my sister later that she and V should do something on Sunday and I’ll spend the day with mom tomorrow and cook her a fancy brunch. No reply. My mom texts me later that Sunday is cancelled and I offer to cook tomorrow and she said it’s okay. I go to my room and I can hear my mom sobbing. My heart hurts. I’m gutted and I know it’s my fault. 

My sister always runs to my mom. Instead of being able to resolve something with me, she said she doesn’t want to fight and goes to my mom and now she ends the night in tears?? My sister came to drop something off, ignored me and goes into my moms room with a sing song tone. Now that they’ve resolved their issues- how can she say I want to keep my mom to myself? And she literally came over and seemed to rub it in my face that she’s mad? I know my mom is upset and it’s my doing. She deserves better.

At 23, no degree, setback after setback and trial after trail with my MH I feel like a huge burden. Being asleep is so much butter than being awake. I haven’t been suicidal in very very long but with this feeling I really don’t know what to do. I can’t afford to live on my own. I pay my mom rent, utilities and buy my own groceries and needs. I wish I could disappear from her life because she would be much happier."
I’m awkward and boring But I want to be more exciting for my girl- she needs it. How can I at least stop being awkward? I have an awkward chin and I’m a mouth breather. Also I just don’t know how to be intimate with someone attracted to me like her. How do I act cool? Or learn to be cool?
"Is it okay to break up with someone because you just don’t feel it anymore? Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost a year. We started dating when I was in college and both of us were not taking life to seriously, everything was about having fun. I graduated last semester and I’m working &amp; in grad school while he still has a over a year of school left. After graduation I moved back home and for four months now we’ve been dating long distance. Recently he’s been saying that he sees us getting married and having kids, but he has no job and still doesn’t take school or anything else for that matter seriously. I feel like I need to end it because I don’t see a future with him, but I feel like I can’t cause he hasn’t really done anything wrong. Is it okay to break up with someone because you just don’t feel the same way anymore?"
"Not cheating but close I found out about a month ago that my gf, of almost a year, let someone give her a kiss on the cheek, which isn’t a big deal, but it was after asking to sleep with her. We had our argument and things were okay for another month or so but just today I found out they slept with each other in the past, about a year ago. I’m upset but don’t know if I have the right to be. Any help?"
"Girlfriend says she hasn’t had sex in a year but her Snapchat texts say otherwise. My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 months but has always been sort of shady about certain things about her life and had told me that she had a boyfriend who she broke up with a year back. I feel like a d*** but I’ve had my reasons to check her phone and while I won’t mention about the previous stuff I found and we had fights over it. I saw one of her snapchats and it turned out she had a fwb from May till around August last year. Also she mentions in her chats with her fwb how she hooked up with a grad school friend of hers. Further, she talks to him about how thinks monogamy isn’t a huge deal and that expecting everything from one person is too much and so she’d rather have multiple relationships to get her needs fulfilled. She talks about how her bf was jealous when she sort of touched upon the topic of being open but bcuz he was good to her she wouldn’t wana risk it. Idk what to do tbh.

UPDATE: I think the post deserves an update. The above mentioned conversations are from May to August 2019 when she was going through a divorce.. We’ve been living together for 4 months since January. I know for a fact she hasn’t been with anyone else bcuz we live together n were up in northern AZ at her dad’s for a month n a half bcuz of covid. I currently don’t have a job and she’s taking care of me as regards food, expenses etc. Also she introduced me to her parents n siblings n also has put me on her health insurance plans just in case. Also the Snapchat chats with that fwb shows that they end in November n again start in April (courtesy covid talk/enquiry) where she tells him about me n how great we’re doing n him saying he’s happy for her n that he too has someone now etc. after all that she has done for me I’m still pissed she lied to me about it. Am I being ungrateful or unreasonably worried."
"What do I do? 😩should I message her or follow her Okay this girl I dated two months ago she was so nice and she didn’t do anything wrong to me but I’m the one who messed up big time and she blocked me on everything and just today she unblocked me but just on one social media and I think she wanted to check on me, like how I was doing 😞

I honestly think I left a imprint on her life...and the truth is I would drop everything in a heartbeat for her i just can’t get the hint"
"Do all relationships just end up shit? I’m almost 30(f). I had a relationship from 16 to 22 and have had 2/3 year relationships since then. My current one being 2 years.

I’m starting to think that maybe I’m just not suited to long term relationships, or maybe relationships at all. But I do enjoy companionship, and loving someone.

Don’t get me wrong, I put the effort in and I know relationships take compromise and work. But I feel like someone always ends up compromising more and resentment starts festering, or you grow apart as you grow older, or your goals change and don’t align with the other.

I feel like around the 2 year mark things just start going downhill. I realise anyone reading this is likely going to say, maybe the problem is you. And maybe it is, I’m willing to acknowledge that.

Kind of just ranting here and wondering if anyone has felt the same."
"What are red flags in an age-gap relationship? I think this is throwRA but it’s jus my 2nd account 

So here’s some background: 
So recently I’ve (18f) started dating this guy (26m) and everything is going pretty well. We were friends for a year before confessing feelings to each other. I can’t help but read a bunch of posts online and things like that saying that such relationships are predatory and the male usually manipulates the younger female into being with them or that it should be a red flag that they can’t find anyone to date their age.
  
We haven’t been going out for too long but I can tell that we both care about each other, but sometimes I can’t help but think that maybe I’m doing something wrong and I’m too young to realize? We talked about the issue of being in two different life stages (like me just finishing high school and him being ready to settle down) and how this can affect things, but this is not difficult and he is willing to wait for marriage once we both are done with college, which is in about 5 years. 
I guess i just want some outside input. Is there anything I’m missing or not seeing that tells me I shouldn’t be doing this? Has anyone had an experience in this kind of a relationship? 

Also, my doubts and reason in posting this isn’t because I don’t love my boyfriend, it’s just my family has been very discouraging and doubtful of our relationship (especially my mother, and I value her opinion greatly) so I’m getting super in my head about this."
"Should I break up with my boyfriend? So my boyfriend (23 M) lent me his MacBook. He had joked around about how he should delete his search history and stuff like that but then preceded to say that it wasn’t necessary because he trusts me. Well he was getting text messages and that red notification makes it really hard to ignore. 

I didn’t open any messages/ message threads because all the contact on the top of the list (the most recent texts) were mostly his family/ friends. Then I found the text thread between his ex girlfriend. The last text that was sent was last December which I thought was weird because my boyfriend had told me that his ex had texted him but that he only replied twice and would tell me if the conversation continued. He never told me that they were still in contact. Anyways, the shocking part to me was that my boyfriend had told her that he was in town- he was away for a business meeting- and tried to make an  arrangement to meet up with her. My heart dropped. They didn’t meet up because their time schedules didn’t align but the fact that he brought up the idea of a meet up first hurts. I wouldn’t have even been bothered by the fact they were going to meet up but he never told me that he was still in contact with her at the time and didn’t tell me he planned to meet up with her. 

I guess what I’m trying to get at here is what do I do? Do I tell him I know? If I do, then I have to admit that I snooped around at his messages. I don’t even know what I’d get out of confronting him. I’m just a little lost. I know this girl was probably the only other girl that he’s had something serious with. He’s going away soon and we are going to try long distance but honestly, this sort of has me rethinking if I even want to try that. Just need some advice"
"How should I (M23) go about asking her (F20’s) out? I’m crushing over a classmate of mine. We’re in the same program at school, studying to become English teachers. Idk how long she’s been at our school, but I transferred here in 2018 and have occupied myself with studies/work/personal affairs so much that I haven’t gotten to know too many people here. She seems to be much more involved in extracurricular stuff. I’ve only had a thing for her for a short amount of time, and believe me if I did a longer time ago I would have gotten more involved. Now that we’ve been quarantined and reaching the end of the semester… it’s a lot harder. 

We follow each other on IG, so I could totally DM her at some point. But we never talk, so I don’t wanna randomly hit her up, I feel like that’d be weird. Plus, even if she liked me, what would we do? Go on a video chat date? Should I just wait for quarantine to be over to try and make a move, or should I try to get to know her over social media? If I ever see her post anything I can comment on I’ll likely hit her up on that, but as of late, whatever she posts is super standard and not a conversation starter. Any tips for a nervous dude crushing hard during a global pandemic?"
"I [f, 26] am reconsidering a 7 year relationship with my boyfriend [m, 26] and its very complicated  xposted to r/realtionships

Throwaway because close friends know my main. This is pretty long but there are so many factors going into it.

A little background, my boyfriend (bf) and I have been together for more than 7 years. We agreed many years ago that we wanted to get married eventually but not until we were in a good place financially. For the most part we get along really well, dont fight too much. We have lived together for 4 years which in the beginning was extremely difficult but we worked on a lot of things and its okay now.

The real problem began about two weeks ago, a new guy started at my job and at first I just had a little crush on him that I tried to brush aside. It isnt the first time another person has caught my eye but it usually goes away pretty quickly, my relationship has been good enough with my bf that its easy to get over the ""crush"". However, quarantine has been adding extra strain on top of all of the coronavirus stress and things with bf have not been great the past few weeks.

It was to the point in the beginning when I first met new guy that the thought of cheating crossed my mind. Then I spiraled into a sort of vicious cycle of hating myself for even considering it, then being confused and conflicted that I even like new guy enough to consider those things, then questioning what it might be about my current relationship that has led me to this point. That brought me down an even longer and more confusing road.

There are a lot of issues that my bf and I have been dealing with long term that I have a hard time communicating on a regular basis, nevermind with the added stress of covid/quarantine. One big thing being that sometimes I really feel more like his mother than his girlfriend. I have a career that I have been confident in from the start. He has a job that barely pays the bills and no solid plans or goals for his future. Every now and then he'll have an idea about what he might want to do but he never follows through and always changes his mind. I have tried to suggest general directions, to offer a little guidance but again I feel like I shouldnt have to be his mom nagging him to go back to school or at least find some actual direction. I also have to hold his hand to get anything done around the house, he went from living at home with his mom to living with me so he really never learned to function on his own. I want to think that maybe with some time apart he would hopefully learn to be more independent and actually develop some of his own good habits.

On top of all this, I work in the healthcare industry. My job is EXTREMELY stressful and at this point in time I barely have the mental or emotional energy to take care of myself. Im pouring everything I have into my job and thats kind of what I want to do right now. I feel like this isnt fair to him or our relationship, but at the end of the day I am absolutely too exhausted to even consider trying to work on our issues. He also deals with depression/anxiety and I feel like sometimes he gets so wrapped up in his own issues that he doesnt have any empathy for what Im going through, or that I might be dealing with that too. Im expected to tip toe around his feelings, and to emotionally support him and thats just not something I can do right now.

Then in my head after thinking about all that I come back to new guy at work. I came out of my first serious relationship and went straight into the relationship Im in now. Ive never really been relationship free for any period of time, and Im at a point in my life where I kind of want to be selfish and I want some freedom. I know that this is pretty shitty of me, and its a really really small factor in making any actual decision, but it does play a part in everything.

I really do love my boyfriend and for so long Ive been imagining the rest of my life with him. But then I wonder is that just the easy way out because thats my comfort zone? I think even if my bf never existed and I met new guy, it would never last long term with him we are just too different. But the excitement and the fun of first meeting someone are really getting to me. I am so confused because I guess I just dont even really know what I want. I feel like my rational side and my emotions are at war, but my emotions are much stronger, but just because what I want the most right now is to just be free and mess around doesnt mean thats the best option. I have thought so hard and so long about every possible option and all of the outcomes but I guess because I dont really know what I want, I have no idea where to go from here.

Im sorry, that was a doozy. Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated. I feel like Im going crazy, theres so many factors that go into this and I just cant figure anything out. My heart and my brain are all over the place and its killing me. Thank you

TLDR; In a long term relationship with bf. Met a new guy, caught feelings. Feelings for new guy causing me to seriously reconsider relationship with longterm bf but it is so confusing and I have so many conflicting feelings."
"How do I [21F] tell the person [25M] that I'm not interested anymore because they're a dry person? I matched with this guy on tinder a few years ago and I basically ghosted him because I was going through some personal issues. Recently he messaged me again and I thought maybe I'd give him a chance. I told him I'm looking for hookups anymore so if he wanted to get to know me I'm in it to actually date someone. We planned a date for after quarantine was over but after talking to him for a few weeks I've come to find that he doesn't have a lot of depth in conversation. We talk about the same surface-level things over and over again and it's really draining to even want to talk to him. I have prompted him for deeper conversations but he swerves it back the other way or even if he answers he doesn't leave room to keep the conversation going. He's also really sexual which I'm opposed because I like to talk about sex but it's not all I want to talk about. I have also told him that he sucks at conversations and nothing has changed much. So I'm in a dilemma if I should tell him, honestly (but low-key brutally), that I need a better effort (which I am also willing to reciprocate) or that I don't want to talk anymore because I feel like we're both wasting each other's time. I also don't want to sound like a bitch to please help!"
"My GF (16) broke up with me M (17)  Mobile formatting sorry.
My girlfriend broke up with me. I’m trying to deal with it and she says we can still have sex but she only wants to see me as a friend. She broke up with me because she was afraid of cheating on me with other guys, which she had a history of (not with me though.) I’m down for being friends for now but I really want her back. I also feel as though there must have been some fuck up on my part because there should have been no worry of cheating if I were perfect. I trusted her around other guys because I didn’t want to be that kind of guy who doesn’t let their girl do shit, I just wanted a trusting relationship so I let her be. And she blamed it all on herself. She has been diagnosed with depression, which might lead to rash decisions on her part. Hopefully she comes to realize it was a rash decision on her part. I just want her to realize that such a small thing shouldn’t come between but whenever I ask if there’s any chance she just says I’m sorry. Like chief I want a yes or no. Please don’t comment that I have my whole life ahead of me I’m aware, that’s what I’m trying to work out. She really is a special person and I fear I’m not good enough with the ladies to cop another good one (She came onto me.) This is the first serious relationship I’ve been in, I know there are plenty of fish in the sea but I feel like the fish jumped straight out of the fountain of youth or something. Advice? Will likely answer and see all replies because I’m in existential dread right now of loosing her and any advice would help. Also should be noted that I already tried praying. Please god."
"I asked her out she said yes. Should I still text her? Like the title says. I’ve hung out with this girl before in the past like 2-3 months ago. Nothing serious but now I want to look at possibly starting a relationship. I asked her out and she said yes, should I continue texting her or should I wait until the date. She also said to remind her the day before."
Is it normal to feel a little insecure when your partner wishes they would have slept around more when they were younger? I know that a lot of people feel that way looking back at their younger days and wish they would have slept around more or got more experience. And it's not a bad thing because humans are curious and do wonder about the what if's and have the grass is greener mindset. Yet... is it normal to feel a little insecure when you hear that even though you know it's common for people to feel that way? Idk I have only slept with my boyfriend and identify as being demisexual. I'm also am a woman so we are socialized differently from men and I get that.  I'm not against sleeping around at all and think people should do what they want as long as they're safe and happy with what they're doing. I just never really felt that desire to have to sleep around or get validation that way? And when I hear it I feel insecure that I'm not enough or that I'm holding him back by being in a relationship with him? I also tend to feel a bit out of place because of being demisexual and not being as sexual as others and do feel a bit insecure about my inexperience at times. I wonder if not being more sexual and experimental is a turn off or something that makes me less attractive. Idk just rambling but want to get other perspectives I guess? Are there any other demisexuals out there that feel out of place or weird for experiencing their sexuality differently than others? People that are in committed relationships and wish the same thing but still want to be loyal to their partner and still satisfied with them?
"My boyfriend not comforting me when i'm grieving Today I lost my grandfather. I was at a small gathering with my boyfriend and his friends. They were celebrating graduating from college and had been planning out a beer olympics for the rest of the day. I went outside when I received a call from my mom and she told me that my grandpa had passed away. I cried for a bit, and my boyfriend came outside and took me back to his house after I told him what happened. he tucked me into his bed because i was sobbing uncontrollably. he asked me if i wanted him to stay and i said ""i don't know"" because i really haven't experienced grief until today. I wanted him to stay but I also didn't want to ruin his whole day. So after i said this he left and went back to his friends house and played beer olympics . I cried for about two hours in his bed before deciding i didn't want to be alone (I struggle with depression, so I didn't think being alone was the safe either) I had my roommate pick me up and she and my other roommate comforted me about the whole thing. 

My boyfriend continued to drink, but text me saying I should come back to his house. I texted him and expressed how hurtful it was for him to not be there for me when I was grieving and needed him the most. He was apologetic but when we talked on the phone about it, he started saying that I should empathize with his side of the situation, because he didn't know what to do or what to say to me. 

I honestly don't know if I should forgive him. I love him and I have been dating him for a year and a half. We've had a great relationship thus far. But this whole situation really makes me wonder about his empathy and care for me. 

Am I being dramatic about this or am I asking too much of him?"
"Any tips on how to get this girl? Hey guys, I want to thank every single one you. I didn't realise how fkn creepy I was being. I'm going to try and forget about her again and hope I can. Thanks so much you saved me from being labeled a creeep"
Are you one to keep momentos of a past relationship/ex? My ex of nearly 3 years and I broke up roughly a month ago. I don’t miss him nor regret the decision but I did make a lot of memories with him over the span of our relationship. I always kept movie and ticket stubs and even had a little book of pressed flowers from hikes and walks we would take during the spring and summer. I have no feelings towards him but am left feeling lost of what to do with the box of momentos. They’re really cute and remind me of those boxes old couples would keep full of notes from the 50’s. I haven’t opened the box in months and i’m not sure if I should trash it or just let it sit and collect dust. What would you do?
"My boyfriend doesn't want to have sex with me? Help! So me (18F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for almost 2 years now and we are happy and in love. Resently I have noticed some kind of change in our sex life. 

My boyfriend used to want to have sex at least twice a week before. Now though he doesn't seem too keen on having sex and it's seriously stressing me out. I have always had low self esteem and I am constantly feeling too fat or unattractive so I feel like there is something in my appearance that he doesn't like anymore. 

We have had sex once in like last month or so and I'm so frustrated because I want to fuck but he doesn't even let me touch his dick (that's nothing new tho). But yeah I am so upset and overwhelmed because of this. I usually cry myself to sleep. 

For the past few weeks I have tried to get him in the mood and today he just went straight to sleep even though I had my whole ass out. It has been over a month since we fucked and I remember him saying that it was the best sex we had ever had. Basically I fucked him and did all the work (which I have no problem with) so I wonder if he is waiting for me to just jump him. Oh wait no last time we had sex it was during day when I didn't want to fuck but I knew that I won't be getting it for a while so I just went with it.

Oh and yes, he masturbates every week when I am asleep (he watches hentai!!!! Am I ugly?). I usually ask him if he's taking care of himself so that's how I know. 

You guys who know what men think, please help! 

(I'm not sure if I should include a picture of my body but in short I guess I'm curvy with small boobs, bigger bottom and a little bit 
of chub)

TL;DR: My boyfriend doesn't seem too keen on having sex with me anymore and I feel selfconscious."
"I (22M) am quarantine at home from college and need help coping with my parent's toxic relationship I'm a college senior who's about to graduate from college. So these past few weeks have already carried the sadness of all the memories I'm missing and the friends I cannot see. These losses hurt a lot, but the biggest struggle for me has been where I am.

I normally dread coming home from college because I spend the entire time listening to my mother and father fight. Even when they aren't fighting, there's an atmosphere of resentment, guilt, and posturing that's unbearable. My mother hates my father. When he talks, she rolls her eyes. She discounts every comment he makes, saying ""that's not what we are talking about"" or ""we all already know that"" or ""you don't really know that."" Basically, she reacts to everything he says as if it was a stupid thing to say, and she often does it in front of other people. She refers to him in third person when he's in the room. She goes around the house muttering about things he's done that she doesn't like. Trivial things like setting his bag somewhere it normally isn't or leaving a plate out or even doing his own laundry ends up causing a scene. She calls him out in public when it is not warranted. My dad spends a lot of time by himself because he never knows what's going to set her off. Friends who are with us always ask me why my mom is mad at my dad, and I have no answer. Because she always is. It's her default state. No matter what he does or says, she doesn't like it. She acts as if she's disgusted by him, and people notice.

But her reason for hating him is this false interpretation that he is persecuting her. She takes his innocent comments as personal attacks ands reads subtexts into them that just aren't there. Asking her a simple question like, ""Hey, has the washing machine finished yet?"" will result in her saying something like, ""Well I'm sorry that I don't work fast enough for you. Let me get my ass in there and move faster. If that's all you think I'm good for."" This kind of repeated thing frustrates him, and the moment he raises his voice, she breaks down as if he were the aggressor, confirming what she's said. It's almost like she's purposefully pushing him to the point where he'll say something mean so that she can feel righteous. She has a mental catalogue of everything he's said and will pull out some comment he made he said from 20 years ago to use against him. And if anyone tries to suggest that her constant belittling is partially responsible for their broken relationship, she'll accuse them of taking his side. And that only feeds into her narrative that she is being attacked by everyone. She has horrible self-esteem and says terrible things about herself, but always frames it as if it is what others are saying, e.g. ""everyone thinks I'm so terrible"" or ""I know I'm no fun to be around"" or ""I know you all hate me."" It's an awful feedback loop: Her constant insistence that we hate her makes us angry, which in her mind only confirms what she's saying. 

Which is not to say that my father is flawless. When her martyr act builds up, he eventually lashes back at her and says things he shouldn't. Even though he knows that it will make things worse. He doesn't have enough self-control. He is also a terrible listener and doesn't understand her at all and provides as little emotional support to her as she does to him. That's the thing: both have legitimate grievances with the other but both see themselves purely as the victim, as if that exonerates their own behavior. They are each going through difficult times with their own parents and it often turns into a contest of who has it worse off, like there is righteousness in suffering the most. The biggest difference between them is that he never starts the fights. And after them, he is willing to own his fault and apologize, while she is unable without acting as if it's still part of the conspiracy against her, saying something like ""I guess I just won't speak anymore."" She'll store everything he said away as ammunition for the next fight.

I have a good relationship with both my mother and father individually, but it's impossible to do anything with both of them because it devolves into fighting. I'm sick of the resentment that permeates every interaction. They're always moping. And it's been like this as long as I can remember. I don't want to think that my parent's relationship will always be this way, but nothing ever changes and talking about it only makes them defensive. I'm getting tired of putting energy into efforts to keep the peace when it never lasts.

My mom also has bad anxiety (undiagnosed) and probably OCD, but she won't do anything about either and no-one would dare approach her about it for fear of her reaction. She can't handle uncertainty or any new plans. Unexpected developments result in loud freak outs where she gets fixated on a single phrase, like ""I can't find my keys. I can't find my keys."" Another thing she'll do is check that the refrigerator door is closed like 12 times. I'm not qualified to say, but it seems like there's something going on there. The fear of coronavirus is naturally making things worse. She's working very hard to keep everything clean and make meals with what we have, but she goes to extremes for no reason. She'll go without eating when we have plenty of food, as if it's some noble thing. She refuses all help from my dad in cleaning or cooking because she doesn't trust him to take proper precautions. She'll allow me to help her sometimes, but even so, it's disheartening to see it fail to ease her anxiety. Because any misfortune constitutes a complete failure to her. She's extremely pessimistic. If her soup goes cold, she'll eat it cold instead of just heating it up and say something like ""of course my soup is cold."" I just watched her throw out an entire cake she made because there was a small problem with it. It's like she set impossibly high standards for herself and then pretends that it is other people who are demanding this of her. Which makes other people mad because that's not true. Which justifies the persecution in her mind. The cycle goes on.

I don't know how to deal with this. It's hard because I see them suffering so much. My dad just tries to stay out of her way, but that doesn't get us anywhere, because it's always been like this. I used to be that way, but going to college has made me confident and articulate enough to voice my feelings. But whenever I try to approach her about it constructively, she gets defensive and says ""you all are constantly telling me my character flaws when I don't do that to you."" (Which is ironic because she is constantly calling out my father's flaws.) 

I need help, especially since I don't know how long I'll have to stay with them. How can I get my mother to change her ways without playing into her suspicion that everyone is conspiring against her? Is there an explanation for her behavior? How do I ease a toxic dynamic between my parents that has been stuck this way for so long? I really appreciate any help."
"She(19F) cheated"" on me (22M) before we got together Hey guys &amp; gurls this is a more complicated story. So in early December i met my now girlfriend. We went on dates an became sexual very quickly and all seemed perfectly. She made me very happy and she admitted she started to develop serious feelings for me, however in early January (we were still dating/no relationship) she told me that she sucked off a random dude for money on a holiday trip. She was very honest about it and told me she was afraid of feelings and moreover afraid losing her independence due to a commitment with me. 
Back then i was pretty shell-shocked to get cheated on in such a weird way. In the afterward i decided to give her a second chance for the simple reasons that she was very transparent about it and was fighting for me. 

Now 4-5 Months later and we are happy young couple in love with the usual conflictes, however i still have certain images in my head and feel somehow guilty for my decision to stick to her and give us and her a second chance. 
I get really uncomfortable when thinking about the fact the she betrayed me and i really cannot stop meantioning the images of her in the act. 

All in all i do not considering breaking up because she really is fighting for me and i feel respected and loved by her. 

If there is anybody that experienced similar issues oder someone with a opinion i would appreciate some feedback. 

(Sorry for spelling mistakes)

Greetings, Have a great day!"
"Dont know how to respond Okay so this isn't really about me but my girlfriend facetimed while crying bc her parents are divorced and so her dad has full custody of her but she stays with her mom sometimes and shes her moms only daughter, but the situation is she was going to her moms house and she asked her mom if she can spend the night at her brothers and her mom said yes but she was upset bc she thinks shes using her just to see her brothers which isnt the case at all she just misses her brothers too, but her mom basically said tell ur dad to pick u up later since u would rather spend time with your piece of shit brothers and not spend anytime with her mom and her moms yelling and saying she hates her bc of al this, and so i hung up bc i told her my mom was calling me real quick but in reality i came here for advice what should i say?"
"I want a porn free relationship and my boyfriend doesn't. I'm F23 LDR my b/22 I told him I'd like to have a pornfree relationship and we can sext I'm up for anything videos photos dirty talking he was once porn addict like 8 months ago, he got over it """"""""he says"""""" I don't really believe his addiction it's over because otherwise he'll like to have my nudes and share time with me which is healthy for our LDR but he keeps watching porn and leaving me on a side ignored and everytime I try to turn him on he says he's not in the mood or he's tired or any stupid excuse. This year we only sext twice (and he lied to me about watching porn) what can I do in this situation I love my boyfriend I love sexting but he prefers porn over me."
"Am I overthinking this? Hi Reddit! I’ve been lurking on reddit for a while and this is my first post. Also I’m typing from mobile lol so I apologize if this turns out weird. This will also be kinda long. 

I am currently a senior finishing highschool, and I have a boyfriend who I have been with for about 7 months. The school we go to has been closed since mid-March, and so we’ve been doing classes online. 

At first, me and my boyfriend would text everyday and check in with one another, and occasionally he would drop by my house to pick something up (like his birthday gift I got him). The last time I saw him was about 4-5 weeks ago, and we would FaceTime occasionally. 

Recently I’ve been the one to engage any form of contact, and if I didn’t reach out first, it would be days before he texted. He would also take very long to respond, or sometimes just not respond to my texts at all. On those times I didn’t reach out first, it would be like 5 days until he would respond, and say things like how he hasn’t been talking to anyone, and he’s been feeling out of it. I brought up that I feel like he’s been pulling away, and that I’m here for him if he needs me to be. He says he takes the blame for this happening and I tell him that it’s both of our faults, as we both have difficulty expressing how we feel, and that we can be more open. 

Things get better for a bit, but then they just go back to us not talking as much. Throughout the quarantine, when we would text and have simple conversation, he would tell me how he’s playing online with friends which I found to be weird because he told me before that wasn’t really being social with anyone? I just kind of found that weird, but I am not sure.

Sometimes I think that maybe he just doesn’t want to talk to me anymore? This is my first relationship and I really do love him, but sometimes it’s hard because I really don’t know what’s going on with him, or if I’m overthinking all of this? Advice would be nice, thank you :)"
"My online friend [M29] and myself [F28] are in a weird loop. Back in January I befriended someone in an online game. We hit it off almost immediately and spent as much time together as we possibly could, given the time difference. I took some time off from work for some personal issues and he had gotten laid off the month prior and was still coasting on vacation time. This happenstance let us spend even more time together and get closer. It was getting to the point where we were spending almost every waking moment together playing games, watching anime together, or just sitting in discord talking. I started catching feelings and made a comment about it, despite being against long-distance relationships. he said the same thing but was very adamant about not ever entering one ever again. We sent each other photos and videos of both sexual and non-sexual things. this just drew us in closer, however he put his foot down and realize that it was going too far. He told me he didn't want a long distance relationship and figured we may need some distance because he felt like that's the road I was going down.

We just remained normal friends and didn't spend as much time together, but he started to complain that he missed hanging out with me. he even called me one night to tell me that he was actually considering lifting his limitation on long distance relationships for me. I knew he didn't actually feel that way because he was so upset when the topic came up last time. I asked if he really felt that way or if he just missed me, and he agreed that he missed me and took his comment back. this made me sad because even though I don't really want a long-distance relationship either, I'd be willing to do it for him because I like him so much. flash forward to a couple of weeks ago, we have another conversation and he once again flip flops and asked if I would date him. At the time I was still pretty upset about this back and forth and I told him no. He ended up telling me the ball was in my court if I ever changed my mind.

I once again distance myself a little bit more because I felt like I was being used for my attention and affection. During this time he put together a birthday present for me which is still on its way. He went out of his way for every part of it, up to and including a card and a handwritten letter. I started to slowly approach him again and I guess went too fast because he freaked out on Monday. He once again thought I was trying to get a relationship out of him, even though I denied his last advance because he can't seem to make up his mind. He brought up saying ""the ball was in my court"" and panicked thinking that's what I was going with. He keeps breaking my heart over and over because he's so scared of long-distance relationships due to bad ones in the past, but he also really likes me at the same time. I really like him too reddit but this constant flip-flopping is tearing me apart. I can't force him to be in a long distance relationship because he very clearly doesn't want one, but I want to be with him so badly because we have so much fun together and we've even talked about meeting in person one day. What do I do?

I should add he's not in a relationship and lives alone so it's not like he's hiding another person. That was my initial thought as well and he even showed me the paperwork to the house, bills, etc. It's just his car and just his PC and closet of clothes.

Tldr 2 idiots like each other but don't want to do a long distance relationship with a 17 hour time difference and bad ldr pasts but adore one another."
"Attention crave. Me (25/M), and my girlfriend (22), are not living together. And ever since the quarantine started we’ve just been texting and calling normally and everything was totally fine. 

After a while, considering there was nothing much to do at home, I started playing video games, and gradually got more absorbed into them.
Problems started recently, when she has expressed how upset she was from me spending more time on video games than I did with her, even though we still talk everyday and honestly nothing new is there. Even when we talk it’s the same topics.
She told me she does not like to ask for attention, and I told her to stop being dramatic because it’s really not that big of a deal IMO. And I shouldn’t be spending every waking hour with her because I have other stuff to do too.
She got super upset with me.

TL;DR: been playing so many video games lately that my girlfriend is upset with me and I called her dramatic. Please help me!"
"should I worry about my safety? so the person who im dating ive known them my entire life .. he always liked me nd i liked him too but things wen we were younger didnt work because moving issues. hes been trying to talk to me for constantly ever since we gotten older but i didnt pay him mind until now .. we have been together and we have out ups and downs like ever other relationship.. but he makes me scared for my safety sometimes.

"Don’t know what to do about a complicated crush So, as all teenage stories begin, I like this girl. This girl is one of my best friends and is also my other friends ex. They broke up a few days ago and they are still best friends. I don’t want to make a move because of our friendship, both with her and her ex, and I am also worried that my friend group will think ill of me for doing so. But at the same time I really like her. I do not know whether to wait and make a move ( however much time that would even be), or to not do so and try my best to get over her. Any advice?"
"Vent session/Advice I do not give permission for this to be shared outside of this group.

So I need advice because I’m lost as fuck and having a hard time dealing with life in general.

Back story: 
I was with my ex for 1.5 years and part of it (6 months) was LDR, but I visited often as I could. During the time I was living in another country. I moved home and he asked about living together to which I agreed. He would make me feel like things were great and I was everything that he wanted. A few months later, I became pregnant and that’s when all broke loose. I should have paid attention but I was in-love (or so I thought). His mother became over bearing with pop-ups and wanting me to monitor his life. For 6 months of my pregnancy he was jobless and home all day while I worked. We would argue and I would want to leave but then you know it was kiss and makeup. Well on Mother’s Day last year, I had a stillbirth and I fell apart. During that time he found employment and so it was rough but he was trying to be positive with life changing and I was trying not drown while on maternity leave. In the 2 months following that event he started acting differently, cold as shit. So I snooped (I usually have trust but my instincts were on fire) and I saw he added his coworker. I didn’t say anything but right after we signed a lease to move in together, he says “Oh I’m not sure how I feel about you” so I respond with let’s back out and go our separate ways. But he pleaded no let’s work things out and stay together. My stupid self agreed and we move. The day after we move in, there are SC messages if I missed you at work, followed by him telling me his attraction to her, which he then tells her. Her response is that’s crazy and Idk what I would do. Following that, I see messages of him offering booty rubs and breakfast in bed and telling her his relationship is falling apart. I say something to him about it and he blows up like my saying something is causing it. I’m like you could have just left me alone bruh. One day he was late to work by 6 hours crying to me about how connected he feels to her and that it’s something he has never felt before. I asked him did he tell her and he said yes. Her response was I’m glad you feel that way. He tells me about she makes him feel and that she fits more of what he wants (looks, and shit) and that I just wasn’t enough. On the 9th day he breaks up with me, then proceeds to tell me everything about me is wrong. On that same day, the coworker is staring me down (before the breakup) and eyeing me hard. Now I was stuck in a TH with him so I asked him to leave and he wouldn’t. His mother comes over to his defense.

Mind you, I’m still trying to grieve the loss of my first child while the Dad is acting like he deserves so much more. I carried his ass the entire time while he was down and out.

2 days later, we get into an argument and he tries to go in on me. He won’t leave and feels entitled so I snapped and moved to another state (I own a home there). Along the way, he’s cussing me out and my brother is reaching out to him and his mom to get it to stop so I don’t crash. She lies about me calling her bitch and I get told I hope you rot in hell. I’m livid, hurt and out of it.

He wants money for breaking the lease but on the day we picked up keys, he bragged he could afford it on his own. So I reminded him of that. He said I owed for utilities and I denied. I covered almost everything, fuck no! Plus, remember he deserve so much more and his new interest was better. He wants the baby’s urn or all of my ultrasound photos (he didn’t want to go to appointments). I’m like nope, not happening.

Fast forward 

He gets a sexual harassment inquiry at work because after I left he started going after her heavy through work applications and social media. She says she didn’t open the inquiry and she starts to distance herself from him. He loses the job because he kept taking time off for bullshit.

We end up in contact through a friend because closure (WTF is that?). We end up talking and he now says she was always just a friend. He couldn’t get use to me and that he felt I was too good for him. He couldn’t be the man he needed to be. I tell him that his “friend” had the wrong impression with hi sharing about the move and him using my car. He tells me no and so I asked did she distance after I left? He said yeah. I respond with where is she now? Does she talk to you? He says no. 

The thing is I saw there exchanges where he told her he was falling in-love and she stating that she doesn’t know what she did for him to feel that way. Her stating he needs help for his mental issues. He sent her poetry and wrote a song for her to which she brushed off. 

But he denies that he did all of that. He also tried to hit on his female friends and any randoms online. To him, this never happened and puts on airs with his friends. 

So then he tells me that when he met me he was broken and then once he healed, he realized that I just wasn’t it. I said hmm, is that right? He wants to be friend and silly me I agree. He tells me that he loves me and all that but doesn’t want to get back together. He wants my comfort though and support. As of now, he’s back jobless, little support from family and single. No girl (or females as he refers to women) took the bait. He’s chasing after every “bad female” on social media (no replies from them) and all the while wants my comfort. He’s also attempting to go after his female friends (no response) with this cocky attitude (about how great he is sex and devoted). The sex is not that great (he is quite stiff) and obviously not devoted. 

When I put distance on his attempts he tries to manipulate me with the “don’t worry about me, I’ll be good.” He’s also like I care for you but you know if this is too hard to be friends then I’ll give you space.

I’m greatly annoyed with myself and him. Me for being so damn stupid and him for putting me through all that bullshit. To his friend he puts off needing a “bad female” that’s freaky and someone he feels so connected with but then he’s trying to be under me. He puts on airs on social media with bragging about his sex and being freaky. He also tries play ultra confident about himself but he’s insecure because he’s always friend zoned, hates how he looks and doesn’t have much. He justifies everything he does and stunts so hard about everything.

I’m not perfect but I’m working on my issues. I was advised to try to be cordial and stuff. But he wasn’t there for me when I lost the baby emotionally and proceeded to be like “I need to focus on me.” He was all about himself and like I was beneath him. Mind you, he wasn’t there much while I was pregnant, I went to most appts by myself.

Now I’m here with the loss of a child in a traumatic experience then hit with a fucked up break up and I’m lost. I feel like I can’t even exist, with an ex who feels entitled, full of hubris, want access to me but also wants to act like Don Juan. Part of me, is like karma please kick in for his ass, break him and part of me is like wrong thing to focus on milady. 

It feels good to share this openly and I appreciate all thoughts and advice. Try not to be hard, negative thoughts are hard to fight."
"I (18F) lied to my boyfriend (18M) ...now he's taking things out of proportion. Hi reddit,

Tonight was a bad night. I was streaming on twitch and one of my friends (who is a male and I said I cut off, more on that later) joined. My boyfriend of a year recognized this as the guy I said I cut off. He got really mad and asked why I did that. I truly did cut him off when I said I did but I forgot I followed him on Twitch as I don't use it regularly. I found out he started streaming so occasionally I watched his streams and we played Fortnite once. Obviously this is hard to believe and I get why he doesn't believe me. However, I felt offended at the way he blew up on me because he also was playing with a friend he said he cut off. The difference is that he told me about it, I was a pussy and didn't bring it up to him.  We are now on break for a week and I'm really afraid he's going to break up with me as he said he is considering it. I feel wrong, trapped, and the heartache is just so painful. What should I do? He has all my passwords to my social media and he knows when I'm on Fortnite which is never without him. He also saw my twitch summaries to show that it was the first time my friend joined. However, he said he watched my previous streams and said he was talking to me on it. I know this is bullshit because this is the first time this friend has joined. I want to calm him down but he wants nothing to do with me right now. Help!

EDIT: added how long we've been together"
"Love is so complex I  am a 28 yr old female and have been with my bf for 7 years.  We have had the most complex love story.  I have never been in love.  Until I met him when I was 21. 

He was so carefree,  funny,  down to earth.  He always wanted to laugh,  enjoy life.  He made my heart flutter,  he made me smile, laugh.  He brought such hope to my life.  I didn't believe in love. I felt it was just a feeling that would eventually cease.  

But for him,  my love always grew.  You couldn't say a bad thing about him.  He was on a pedestal for me.  He made me feel utterly safe.  Nothing could hurt us. I couldn't imagine life without him.  

But time grew. And his spark of life slowly diminished.  He started to think I could possibly betray him.  He became convinced with the idea I had been with another guy. Even though I swear up and down I haven't.  I could never do him dirty like that.  

I know what its like to hurt,  to be cheated on.  It straight up sucks.  And it feels so unnecessary.  Why hurt someone you love for someone you dont love? I believe thoroughly that sex isn't something you just give away. It's such an intimate moment to share with another person.  Why would someone just give it away to just anyone? I never could understand that.  

I love this man so much.  My heart breaks bc I wish I could just let him hear how my heart feels.  I wish I could just make him feel everything I feel for him.  

He says he loves me. And I believe him.  But he is so untrusting of ANYONE that he always had doubt in me. Always questioning how I could truly love him.  

Seven years later,  through so many hardships,  I still love him so much.  My heart literally aches,  I can't sleep when we fight. I can't imagine not having him in my life.  But how can I get him to see that I truly love him? Its been so long and I've never left his side.  I always seek him.  I can't wait to see him the next day.  I can't wait to hear his voice. To listen to him laugh bc I did or said something funny.  He's my best friend.  

When we fight,  I physically feel sick.  I cry into my pillow and feel like I got punched in the gut. I can't sleep. I'm so restless. I hate that he doubts me.  I hate how he can speak to me,  find reasons to hate me when he's upset with me.  But all I've done is love unconditionally. I wish he could see how much it hurts me to be on bad terms. That we can't discuss a fight until he's ready to either face it. Let alone even talk to me.  The silence is terrible.  The waiting for him to text just so I can know he's doing ok. 

I just want to be in love.  I don't want it to be so hard.  I know I love him. I know he loves me.  He always tells me he doesn't want anybody else.  Then why doesn't he just have me,.. appreciate being in love. Relearn a person and remember why you fell in love.  Isn't love worth fighting for if you truly love one another? Can't it be saved? What can I do? My heart hurts so much.  I just want to be happy.  To have that one of a kind love.  Especially with my best friend.  Idk."
"I am doubting if my boyfriend [25M] and I [22F] are compatible So to start off, I love my boyfriend. He is the kindest, sweetest person I know, he doesn’t have a mean bone in his body. I love him because of how sweet, funny, and genuine he is, I can be really focused and serious and he always knows how to make me laugh. We have been together 2.5 years. But there are issues in our relationship that I feel like don’t matter now, but I worry how they will affect us later, and I need to know if I am being crazy. 

So my boyfriend is very forgetful. He has forgotten my birthday, he has forgotten Valentine’s Day, even after I kindly tell him that I would like him to make plans for the day. We are quarantining together in his apartment right now, and he tries very hard to be helpful. Twice now, I have slept in, and he wakes me up excitedly telling me that he went grocery shopping to help me out. He forgets several staples that we need (eggs, milk) and buys very random stuff that we don’t need and have plenty of (spices, bacon). I then have to go to the store again anyways, and come up with meals to use the extra stuff we have. I do tell him to please look in the fridge beforehand, but it’s not working. I also cook because he isn’t very good at it, and I do about half the dishes because he will do all the plates and pots, but not do the silverware, pan lids, glasses, things that are easy to overlook. I try to remind him of things, and he’ll get improve for a short while, but will revert back to his old ways. My future career will be very stressful, but I’ll end up making 2-3 times more than his salary. I have no issue with this, but it seems like in the future if we live together I will have to do the majority of the chores and family scheduling on top of my much longer hours/stressful job. 

On top of this, I worry about what raising kids with him will be like. A few weeks ago, the two of us were on a walk and we found a scraggly, sick, abandoned puppy. We took it to the vet, posted an announcement in the neighborhood, etc. but we haven’t found an owner, and given its condition it’s likely abandoned. He had been considering adopting anyways, and we took it as a sign that we should keep it. We both have experience with dogs, and we are trying to house train the puppy. Because he is such a softie, my boyfriend spoils the dog, giving it treats even when it behaves poorly, lavishing it with attention 24/7 even though it’s important for the dog to get used to some independence, etc. I am trying to put my foot down and be more disciplined with the dog, and now the dog adores my boyfriend, and is basically attached to him. 

All of this really has me on edge. We both want children, and talk about getting engaged in a few years once I’m done with school. I have this vision of my life, where 20 years in the future I have a family with this man. I work long hours and come home to even more work. My children are crazy about my husband, but view me as the mean mommy who is never home. This sounds like a nightmare. But at the same time, I can’t imagine breaking up with my boyfriend or having a future with someone else. 

Do people change/grow out of these habits? Am I expecting too much out of this rather young relationship? Should I just go with the flow and not try to be so tightly wound? Any advice appreciated, thank you. 

TLDR: my boyfriend is forgetful and a pushover, are these things that make us incompatible long term?"
"I (F30) feel like I’m going crazy talking to him lately (M30) I need some help understanding what is happening in my relationship. The more I think about it, the more it wears me down and confuses me.

During our year together, we have a lot of amazing times, but communication hasn’t been great. When I would tell him it would make me happy if he showed interests in my life or what I like, he never saw why he should do it. For example, he would say, “just tell me what you want me to say and I’ll say it” or “you know I don’t care about food.” 

If there is an issue, he always begins with denial (“what are you talking about?”). I always remind him that he did nothing wrong and I just need some help feeling better. But then he starts changing what happened or saying it didn’t happen at all. It makes me feel like I’m going crazy, but he acts unfazed. Then he starts to say I’m too emotional when I get upset that he’s doing this and I need to calm down. He then gets into how I need a new therapist, new meds, I bring all these problems in our lives everyday and we can’t live like this. He starts throwing in how I think he’s such a bad guy, but he does all these nice things for me and I must really dislike our relationship (I never say anything bad about him! I do my best to tell him it’s my fault and my needs and I ensure it has nothing to do with anything else in our relationship).

Each time, he tells me he had no intent to hurt my feelings, so I shouldn’t feel bad about it. He constantly tells me that normal people don’t complain like I do, because they give people the benefit of the doubt. I try to explain I don’t think he does things purposefully at all, but he continues to call me too emotional and I need to better control my actions. 

He also mocks me and puts me down, but twists it to make it seem like he isn’t. For example, he snapped at me when I asked him if I could buy him steaks for dinner. The words were what hurt me not the food, but he kept saying, “it’s unbelievable you’re mad about a stupid steak.” I asked him to please stop, because he knew it wasn’t just that and it made me feel stupid when he suggested that. He continued to say it over and over again. He’s says this isn’t mocking, so maybe I’m wrong?

When I was leaving his place last night, he said, “and I think you need a new therapist” out of nowhere. I asked him to please stop, but he continued. 

I just don’t get how he can be so kind and protective at times, yet so callous and hurtful if he feels he could have done anything wrong. I tell him right or wrong doesn’t matter. I’m asking my partner to work with me to figure out how we can grow and do better. 

He absolutely thinks I’m in the wrong and his way of thinking is consistent and healthy. But, the negative things he tells me about myself sticks with me and makes me feel so low and I can’t bring myself to advocate for myself anymore.

He doesn’t see the issue. He thinks I need to be less emotional. I’m so tired and I can’t figure out if I’m going crazy. Please help me understand what I can do to fix things."
"It's been over 2 weeks since we've had sex... ... and I am losing my goddamn mind. We've been together almost 2 yrs (in Aug), live together, and things are mostly great, except for the fact that my (37/f) sex drive is through the fucking roof compared to his (33/m). He's physically and verbally affectionate, gropes and grabs, and I love it, but when it comes to actually fucking, he either shuts down or shoots me down.
How often do you childless couples have sex?
Also, please don't come at me like I'm the one responsible for keeping him ""up."" You don't know how much I do for this relationship, and he doesn't exactly ""woo"" me, either. Never really has, honestly.

Edit: Please refrain from leaving obvious comments. I don't live under a rock."
"My (22F) boyfriend (24M) wants to move in, best friend (23F) very verbally disagrees making me feel dumb and naive So my boyfriend and I have been together for well over a year now. We started being together in the same city but he was offered a job in Madrid last June and has been there since but due to being laid off in work, he is in the middle of interviewing/signing contract for job back in my city, I still live at home with my parents but have wanted to move out more seriously for a few months now and just 2 days ago my boyfriend said that maybe when he finalizes his job back here we can find somewhere together. Obviously, due to coronavirus this won’t be instant, but he will be signing a contract soon and then looking at flights back home, self-isolating for 2 weeks and so on. 

I have mentioned to my parents probably about a year or two ago that I want to move out and take the next step in my life, but my mam says there is no point and to stay home. My dad is indifferent and says I should do as I feel. But they are aware that it is something I want to do, and they both know that I have been working during college and saving money for moving out/getting a car/basically a future.

Just today I told my bestfriend (she has never had a boyfriend or been with anybody, only kissed someone, maybe that’s where her reaction is coming from, but also her mam does absolutely everything for her and she has never had a job, not even weekends during college or anything) that my boyfriend said that me and him living together is something he would want but to take the time to think and talk through it. Straight away she said „I cannot imagine sharing a room with someone right now or living with anyone at all” to which I said that it would be us two more than likely sharing with somebody, rather than an apartment to ourself. Then she continued „I don’t think you should move in with him, move out but by yourself for at least a year and then start to think about living together”. 

Is it really that bad to move out for the first time but with your boyfriend? Rather than living alone/sharing with roommate and not partner? 

Myself and my boyfriend have talked about our future and while not setting any specific timeline for ourselves we both mentioned living together, getting married, having kids even though we know we are young and anything is possible but have expressed how we feel etc., but now I feel like maybe I’m too naive and shouldn’t move in with him? (Even if it’s not for another few weeks or months) 

Also I understand we are in a LDR so going from that to living together may be a huge step but have spent consecutive weeks together before the virus, both me travelling to him and him to me as well as us going away together for short and long holidays. We were quite surprised at how similar our ‚living’ styles and while we have our differences we work together well. Also, like any other couple we have our arguments and such but have learned to communicate and improve even with distance which I am really proud of. 

TL;DR: boyfriend mentioned moving in together (would be my first time moving out, not his) and my best friend is completely against it making me feel super stupid and naive"
"My (23M) ex girlfriend (20F) is possibly seeing one of my best friends It is my first post on this subreddit and I'm not too experienced with Reddit either but I can't sleep at all because of this so here goes. 

The good friend in the story will be called Paul to make it easier to read and write.

When me and my girlfriend were still together we hung out with a group predominatly based around one common interest. With the group we had a get-together every weekend for a small trip or just a night of watching some game. The group consisted of me, the ex, Paul and two other dudes.

Me and my girlfriend broke up half a year ago on good terms after an almost 2 year relationship. We had a quiet time for a while till we eventually met again at a party organized by Paul. 

I didn't know she'd be there so I was uncomfortable at first but we got along well eventually. She got invited by Paul but he forgot to tell me. 

However, ever since this party Paul and my ex have been texting every day religously. They're also meeting up very often because they comfort eachother when theyre both feeling a bit under the weather or when they need someone to talk to. 

I was a bit worried at first but ultimately Paul told me to not worry about it as I could trust him, he said. And this was exactly what I've been doing for a few months now. But things haven't changed at all. They still meet up every other day and my ex even texted me a few moons ago to ask me how i'd feel about them possibly going a little bit beyond ""friendship"". 

Im this exchange of texts I told her that I'm not in a position to forbid and/or get angry at them for going that route. I did tell her that I would no longer want to see either of them and ultimately leave the group as that would no longer be enjoyable. This is where she got super angry at me because I was giving them an ultimatum; if they hook up, im gone. 
In these waves of textual aggresion she proclaimed that I have been terrible towards her during the relationship and acusing me of abusive behavior. 

Anyways, I thought I was fine after this but it is seriously eating me up. The thought of them even kissing is making me extremely uncomfortable. 

TL;DR : I had a gf for almost 2 years. We broke up and I saw her again months later at a party a good friend gave. From then they started hanging out every other day since and I cant stop thinking theyre hooking up."
"Boyfriend (22) dislikes my family My boyfriend and I have really been struggling since moving into my moms house because of quarantine. We moved from California and lost our jobs due to the pandemic. We are living with my mom and little sister. He is not happy here. (Is anyone living with other peoples family?)

He seems to target my family instead of trying to accept that living with ANYONES family can be really tough. He’s even gone as far as to attack them saying all we do is play animal crossing. Which is not true, and there isn’t a whole lot to be doing right now anyways. 

I love him dearly, but this is causing a lot of friction in our relationship. We do not have a car up here so we can’t even get out for a drive or a hike. He said he “hates being stuck in the house with my family.” I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to be with him but I don’t want to move to live with his parents which is the only other option we have besides breaking up. I’m just lost..."
"I'm [24F] about to break up with my boyfriend [25M] of 4 years, what do I say? So with this whole virus thing happening I feel bad for breaking up during this time but honestly I don't think it's fair for him that I keep on making him think nothing is wrong. I'm not happy anymore, I've lost trust in him many times, the relationship is full of empty promises from him, I feel under appreciated, I've tried so hard to please him, neglected myself and lost my identity, and have lost friendships because I always put him first. He's not completely to blame because I also let myself. I had severe low self-esteem and my fear of the unknown if anyone else will love me kept me in the relationship. So I'm meeting up with him in half an hour to break up. 

Do I say specifically what was wrong and go into detail? What are the best things to say based on my reasons? I want to be firm and not give him hope but he is also really sensitive and says I am the love of his life and I feel bad but I have to do this now. Any genuine advice appreciated."
"How do you know true love? I wanna know, how do you know when you’ve found “the one”? I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years and he’s starting to bring up proposing soon and I’m freaking out. (We are 21 and 22 btw) I’m just not sure if he is “the one”. I love him, don’t get me wrong. We have been through a lot together and I know that’s so cliché but it’s the truth. I guess I just wanna know how I will know. Because right now I don’t. I’m an only child and fully enjoy my alone time. This pandemic isn’t helping my thoughts either because he’s going crazy not seeing me and I’m content at home not in any rush to reunite. Help😬"
"Would taking a break be helpful to my (31F) relationship with my boyfriend (34M) ? *(I apologize for any mistakes, English is not my first language)*

TL;DR : My 34yo boyfriend of 4 years doesn't fully commit to our relationship due to his past, it has become difficult for me to envision a future with him. We're deeply attached to each other, don't want to split up. Would a break benefit us in this situation, as an ""eye-opener""?

\-

So we've been together for 4 years and living together for 3 years. 

For the last 2 years, things have become gradually hard for me to handle, and the lockdown really opened my eyes about this. 

He smokes weed every single day (not much but still) which was not the case when we started dating, drinks a lot of alcohol in general, has gained weight; he doesn't care for his health and lives by the day. He takes the slightest part of housework. He rarely shows interest in making love, and I'm sure weed is partly to blame here. He spends most of the weekends party-drinking with his friends if we don't have anything planned together, and also spends a tremendous time playing games on the tablet. He always forgets everything and I have to remind him stuff all the time, carrying the mental burden. I'm very patient and have brought up all of these issues with calm discussions in the past, he told me 100 times ""I'll work on it"", and never did or even tried.

Anyways, I sometimes feel like I don't live with a 34yo man, but a teenager, and that I'm not his priority. After hours of talking I also realized I don't live with someone who is 100% committed into the relationship, otherwise he would have ""worked on it"" earlier. He admitted this to me when he told me five days ago ""maybe it's because of the way my first love left me, it took years for me to rebound"". This was 10 years ago, she dumped him the day of his birthday, after 5 years of relationship, telling him she found another one. So yes, I totally understand that after this, he would be fearful of commitment and that would explain a lot why he didn't ""work on it"", maybe he thought I would eventually just leave him so why bother? I could understand this. But **after 4 years together ?** Especially since we talked about having kids multiple times? I don't get it. And I've done nothing but innocently loving him with all my heart, writing him my best pieces of poetry, proving him that he could count on me for anything, listening to him, complimenting him all the time, being sincere and open-minded, letting him live his life as he wants to, taking care of myself and being always put together, initiating sex all the time. I don't get what I could have done wrong for him having doubts to commit to ""us"".

All I want is for him to grow up a little, be responsible and show some commitment by making efforts and opening up more to me.

I know he genuinely loves me and wants me to be happy, he shows it to me every single day in his own manners. And I still have feelings for him but it has become hard to envision a future with him (especially children) if he doesn't 100% commit to me and grow up, which is a shame because he is such a good, kind and loving guy apart from this behavior.

We talked about all this for hours, we're still very attached to each other and certainly don't want to split up as of now, he's made it clear he doesn't want to lose me and I'm actually afraid leaving him would turn out to be a huge mistake. We're both considering that taking a break would benefit us, especially since the lockdown has made us argue a lot about these issues and the atmosphere is now quite heavy and doesn't allow a clear thinking. We see in this break the possibility to think about the relationship alone and away from the arguments, reevaluate our love for each other and see if the efforts from both ends would be worth it - not in any way as a hall pass to go see other people (I clearly don't intend to, he doesn't either) - and the outcome would be realizing if yes or no both of us are ready to work together **as true partners**, and I expect to know if he's ready to grow up, or would rather give up.

What do you think about this? Would taking a break help in this situation or am I just delusional?"
"Anyone else married to a cop ? Recently I’ve been having a hard time dealing with my husband barely being home . I’m glad he’s doing what he loves but at the same time I feel like it’s ruining our relationship . And the time that he is home consists of him just talking about his job and to be honest I hate it . I’ve tried talking to him about us having a time to talk about his job but I feel like a jerk considering that he is at work 5 sometimes 6 days a week so it’s kind of hard for him not to, and this whole covid19 isn’t helping . Any advice ?"

"Tinder date told me my close friend sexually assaulted her. I (F) matched with a girl (I’ll call her Lily) on tinder. We were naming off mutuals we had and I brought up my close friend, Jamie. Lily then told me she hated him and when I asked what he did, she told me they at one point were in the “talking” stage and he sexually assaulted her. Lily didn’t give any details (and I obviously told her she did not have to tell me anything). She likes to think he wasn’t himself at the time but avoids him like the plague. Despite the awkward topic Lily said she would love to be friends with me regardless. Just obviously not with him.


I’m not sure what to do. I told Lily I really want to be friends and I would never bring him up or have them in the same room for anything. But should I confront Jamie? It’s not my business and I don’t want to make things worse for anyone but at the same time I feel like I’m protecting him by just ignoring it. Like, how can I hang out with him and just know that? And him not knowing that I know? I’m confused. He is a really really close friend. We are family without the blood. I’ve known him my whole life and I consider him a brother. He is going to be at my older brother’s birthday party next month.

Any advice?"
"I (21M) get so nervous prior to hooking up with this one girl(22) that it kinda seems forced and we decide not to hookup 

So, bit of background info, met this girl 3 years ago, nothing happened because I didn’t have my shit together and she was always a sweetheart.

Dated for 2 years after that, and now that I broke up 6 months ago, we started texting, and things instantly went so well, like the best dates I’ve had, and then she went to do an exchange outside of the country, we decided that it made sense to still text and talk, the thing is that it escalated so hard through text, that we both knew the next time we set a date, we were gonna hookup.

This girl although gorgeous, on a scale from 1/10 she is clearly an 8, clearly above me, she is insecure, and sees my ex like a girl she can’t compare to, which body wise is true, my ex was stunning body wise, but I don’t even see my ex 
as all that, but to her, it makes her super insecure, and I know she sees my reaction described down here as “I’m not good enough for him to hookup with me”. 


Today was the date, and it went super smooth, until the part we cuddled and I got so nervous I paralyzed and just didn’t continue with the romantic way of things, I kinda freezed, and after that, I said, it just feels forced, the way it’s going is not right, it feels like we got so ahead with messaging, that doing this just makes things feel forced, and not natural.
She agreed and we did not kiss, in 4 days it’s her birthday, I’ve got everything set, I’m gonna buy popcorns(it’s a thing of ours), we are gonna go to the balcony of my beach house and just stay there talking and cuddling and shit and hopefully kiss her so she knows I fucking like her and she doesn’t need to compare to anyone, because to me, there’s no one prettier than her.

So Reddit, how can I calm myself down and just go for the next step without freaking out?"
"My(23F)cousin sister is living with me(24F) during the pandemic and I’m having flashbacks of her climbing on top of me and sticking her tongue in my mouth when we were 10-13 and I haven’t been able to look at her properly. This is the second cousin sister that has been sexual with me. It’s bit of complicated situation and I’ll try to be as clear as possible.

My cousin and I grew up together, both had volatile households, each with a bipolar parent who were related.  At about 8 years old she was the one who strangely taught me sexual things. (Rubbing yourself on a pillow, touching each other, masturbating with a faucet etc) I always wondered where she got these things from because we were pretty young. 
Flash forward a few years, 10-13, we were at a sleepover at her place with two other friends , and I woke up in the middle of the night with her on top of me, sticking her tongue into my mouth and trying to kiss me. I still remember the feeling of her tongue vigorously moving around my mouth and over my braces. I pretended to be asleep and after about a minute she stops and goes back to bed. We woke up the next morning and I never mentioned anything. We’ve remained close friends through the years and I don’t think she knows that I was awake. 

Another incident with a different cousin sister resulted in a semi consensual act of dirty truth or dare which resulted in quite a lot of sexual play. It was my first time doing anything, and I went along with it because I didn’t want to seem silly or lame and wanted to impress her. After that time, I saw her 5 years later and I wondered if I had dreamt the whole thing.

Fast forward 3-4 years, a friend of mine, a boy fondled me while we slept next to each other. I never told anyone until a few years later, at about 21-22. 

Other isolated incidents have happened with minor sexual assault that I have dealt with.

Which finally brings us to 2020, COVID 19 prevails and my first cousin sis, the one who stuck her tongue in my mouth is staying with me. She’s been staying with me for a while now and my sexual assault with this boy comes up again. I find out that she has brought it up with him, without my permission and a slew of other things went down. I’ve been dealing with career stress, sleep paralysis and anxiety along with her heavy emotional upkeep. She’s overly sensitive and gets upset with me quite frequently. I’m the quiet one of the two. 

This minor incident brought back flashes of her climbing on top of me and violating me and I don’t know how to tell her to leave me alone.

How do I face this situation when her one callous comment about my story that she used to “defend” me with him, has now brought up all the sexual assault issues that I never dealt with, ESPECIALLY hers. I can never say anything as we have many mutual friends.

I’ve been trying to process my feelings and not doing a very good job. I’m trying to understand if these events have impacted me in any way before today as I have never confronted them."
"My boyfriend lied about how serious his previous relationship was I'm 26, my boyfriend is 29, we've been together for 1.5 years, he introduced me to his parents early on and it is serious… we plan to get married. We are LDR but manage to see each other once every week. 

We spoke about past relationships the other day... he told me he had one that lasted 3.5 years through uni up until they graduated (aged 18-22). And so he was single for 5-6 years before he met me... I think mostly because he hasn't been ready to settle down until recently so he wanted to take his time. When I questioned him about whether it was serious, he told me it wasn’t – that they were childish and fooled around a lot as it was uni... he had a lot of fun at uni, and had gone from a sheltered upbringing to his first taste of freedom. He hid the relationship from his parents up until the end, as they are strict. I struggled to believe him, so I told him that it’s impossible to spend time in a 3.5 year relationship without some degree of seriousness… he said ‘You weren’t there, you didn’t know me then. You don’t know anything about it. It means nothing. It wasn’t serious’. I asked him if he wanted to marry her… he said ‘no lol’.

I find the marriage part odd considering they would've spent a heap of time together, he is a genuinely good guy, and I've seen tagged pictures of them online where they're out drinking with friends and they do look happy. Also I get that he used to be very immature and that they messed around, but it's important to have fun in a relationship and surely something must have worked for them to have been together for that long. I can't imagine my boyfriend 'fooling around' as he is a decent guy. He has told me that he's never felt the way he does about me about anyone before, and that he's always seen me as his future... but then during a recent argument (where I was questioning our future) he told me he'd never waste so much time with me if he didn't. So he must've seen a future with her considering 3.5 years, in terms of emotional investment, is a significant time although it could've also been a thing of convenience as he didn't exactly have to put a huge amount of effort in to seeing her every day etc, where he does with me. When I asked him why they broke up he said it had ran it’s course. I also think they stayed friends and hung out together in their friendship group after the break up, so I’m assuming the break up was mutual.

I've seen a lot of tagged photos of them on social media (those uploaded by their friend). A lot of these are taken in clubs/ bars, where she is on his lap and they're cuddling and happy. There's a few where he's looking deep in to her eyes (but he also looks drunk). I've seen videos of them doing pranks on each other and friends, and seen a comment by him on a photo of his ex saying 'she was farting so much in my bed last night I had to spray her ass'. This upset me as I think about how often they must've shared a bed within their time together. Once I brought this up with him and he told me to stop being silly, that I'm 'the one' and we have the rest of our lives together for that. His ex also used to make a lot of jokey comments on pictures of him. My boyfriend also used to post comments like 'can't wait for the next f\*ckin sesh, so hyped' etc etc. His ex was/is very much a party girl too. Whereas now he hardly ever drinks and is very sensible in general…he likes that I hardly drink too. Still though, I have images in my head of them being in bed together and making serious plans for the future, talking about how they’re going to get married and have children etc, in the same way that he does with me. We also sometimes don’t have an awful lot to talk about, but then I think they must’ve always been talking together as they would’ve had so much in common. Also, sometimes when he says really lovely things to me I wonder if he ever said the same things to her. Am I crazy for thinking like this? It’s weird because when I first saw these pictures and comments, I shrugged it off thinking it was such a long time ago anyway, and that she would’ve had him when he had little life experience and money so I have the better deal. But now my thinking has completely changed.

Just wondering how a relationship lasting so long can be non serious? Especially as it was their first and presumably would've been in each other's pockets (same course, same friends etc). Whilst I do believe that it’s more about quality over quantity, if it only lasted a year I wouldn’t be thinking this much in to it, but over three years is a LONG time…something must have gone right for them and he wouldn’t have invested so much time if he didn’t see a future, right? They lost their virginities to one another – surely this makes it serious enough? Before he introduced me to his parents he made a point of telling me he's never done anything serious like that with a girl before. But then I see the pictures of them and they look extremely happy. Part of me really, really wants to believe him (especially for my own sanity) but then I do feel like he has lied to just keep me happy and shut me up. I’ve read threads online and the majority of people do tend to say their young relationships still counted as serious, and that at the time they felt they were ‘the one’. My boyfriend is outright denying this, despite the fact that they spent all their time together. So I find him hard to believe.

Does it sound like he is telling the truth?"
"I (17F) lied about my age on Tinder, but now I'm serious about someone who doesn't know I lied So I'd like to preemptively reduce any hate I might get by establishing that my state's consent laws firmly establish that people sixteen and older can consent. This is important, because I (17F) was on Tinder using a fake name and, obviously, a fake age. I'm in college and pretty so mature, and as I didn't intend to match with anyone I really liked (quarantine and bored, mostly) I didn't think it was a huge deal. However, I met this really cute, nice guy. We really hit it off, and we've been talking for a while and intend to meet post-quarantine (he also lives in my state, to clarify). 

The thing is, I haven't told him about how old I actually am. I haven't set him up for any problems with the law or anything (god forbid) (as established by state law etc etc), but I think it'd be better to be honest. I really like this guy and I don't want to fuck it up more than I already have. Any advice? Both as to whether I should or how to do it."
"My(21they/them) dad (40s M) is an alcoholic and I don't know if I should keep telling my (40sF) Mom when he's been drinking This is my first post and on mobile so I'm gunna do my best to be quick and try not to give many details because my parent is on here.

I moved back home temporarily to live with my parents and my siblings (3 Between 13 and 25). 
For some background information, I've been back and forth for a few years usually only for a few months at a time. Since they got together and had my youngest sibling things have been really weird. My dad was in a bad Accident before he met my mom and has some brain issues that are technically supposed explain everything he does but- he has a serious drinking problem. There's been a few times over the 13 years where he's managed to go a few months without drinking (to our knowledge) and things seemed fine but I was a child during those times and I'm starting to think maybe they really weren't. So now I'm an adult and I have a good relationship with my mom, when I'm home, I let her know when my dad is drinking. I feel so awful, because she's already been so stressed, they haven't slept in the same bed for months (almost a year if I'm being honest) and my mom is at her wits end trying to move when my dad doesn't help at all and my siblings and I can only do so much. So I feel bad when I add stress to her day by telling her everytime, but I feel like she should know, legally she's considered a caretaker of him and with moving they're trying to save as much money as possible and his spending habits ( a lot of other things are problems) already stress her out, especially when it's alcohol. I don't know if I should keep telling her or if I should just let his demise become of him, but he's also responsible for a child for a few more years. And I don't want them to get divorced because he and my youngest sibling have a great relationship compared to the rest of us kids and our relationship with our bio dads- My biological father was also an alcoholic/Addict so my mom has been through this before and one of my siblings and I have been, but my youngest sibling is my stepdad/Mom's kid. I feel like she puts up with it for my sibling so they don't have to ""grow up without a dad"" too. It's all very weird and I feel like when I leave again I'll feel guilty if it only gets worse and I didn't do/say anything

Tl;Dr: My stepdad has a brain injury and is an alcoholic and I dont know if I should keep telling my mom when he's been drinking because she's already stressed from trying to move and it's been a problem for their entire relationship"
"Is it wrong that I want to be in a relationship with someone I find more attractive? My long term relationship has been in the gutter for a while now. We've been together for years though, but I can't help but want to be in a relationship with someone the same size as me, who doesn't make me feel ashamed for how I look. There's not really a question I guess."
"My (19F) boyfriend (22M) hates everything that makes me happy. I've lurked on this subreddit for quite some time now, and I've always wanted to post something but I read other peoples situations and always feel like my problems aren't worth posting when other people have larger issues that deserve the attention, but as I try to study for my finals, this is all I can think about and I need to put it somewhere and I need help to try and figure it out.

Recently, I've been getting excited about things with my boyfriend. I know I am young, but when I'm with him I really do believe this is the guy I'm going to spend the rest of my life with, everything is always perfect, but then sometimes, it really isn't. I tell him about my dreams, the ones I have for myself and obviously I talk to him about them and include him, I say I can't wait until we have a home, we get our own cats and dogs, but he doesn't like cats and he will never let me just dream, he has to point that out, that he hates cats and has no desire to own any. Fine. 

I told him I wanted to go to on vacation to Disney, no timeframe, just that I wanted to go again soon, the two of us. He immediately shuts me down, saying ""why would I want to spend money on that? There's so many other nicer places that we could go"" and I mean I get it, if he isn't into that, but it's something I wanted to do at some point, and he shut it down just like that. He also makes me feel childish for wanting it, like Disney is for kids and their parents, just kinda killed my spirit. 

I know it's naive of me in a way, but I'm a very romantic person, I love flowers, I love notes anything that kinda makes me feel special, and I had been talking to coworkers and they tell me about their promise rings, and I dont know, the concept of it is sweet to me. He tells me he wants to marry me some day, but we are young, we're in school, and I just felt like that would be something that would make me feel good. I asked him about his opinions on it, and told him I would never ask him to buy me anything expensive, but I wanted that kind of symbol of commitment, I even said it could be a ring from a gumboil machine, I love him like that I don't need fancy, just something romantic. He immediately shut that down too, said that it was stupid, and immature, and that it just wasn't something adults do in adult relationships (I met him when he was 20 and I was 17, I was his first gf and the first girl he's ever been with). I feel like he just could have expressed that he didn't think that was necessary without making fun of me for thinking it was romantic is all. 

This kind of stuff happens often, I find that I can't really enjoy things if he doesn't. I still think I'm a kid, because I am, and I feel as though he wants to be so grown up, but I don't get why because we are just kids, and I'm his first girlfriend, why wouldn't he want the child like fun? Why does everything have to be so serious and ""mature""?

I mention this to him whenever it happens, that I feel as though I can't enjoy things if he doesn't, but I try to explain it in a way that doesn't make me seem like I'm starting something, but over and over he makes me feel like I'm starting something out of nothing. ""You're mad that I said I didn't want to go to Disney?"" or ""Your mad that I didn't want to buy you a ring? Because I won't buy you expensive jewelry?"" He sees it however he wants to, and there's no budging, so I always have to let it go. 

It's even come down to sex. I am not entirely comfortable with not looking at him during it, because of trust issues and trauma from previous experiences, and I try to spice it up as best I can while knowing what I can handle, and when I tell him I just like looking at him and how intimate and romantic it is, he tell me he loves it, but it does get boring and repetitive, and that we've been together too long for me to still be insecure about it. Ouch.

So, I've been explaining to him a lot, since we met, that I wanted to get breast augmentation. It's something I've wanted since I stopped growing and developing when I was 14. I felt like I was a good candidate as I have not grown at all since the age of 14 and I have been saving for that, and only that and I finally have enough to pay for it. I tell him today that I am 100% sure I am getting it done, and he has always loved me for how I am, and I know he doesn't care about the change, but he immediately told me ""I support you BUT I think you should just hold on to the money, because I know I feel good when I save my money"". The point of saving was for this, something I've wanted, I politely told him I respect his input but this is my decision and I've wanted this since I was 14 and I finally am old enough and have the money to do it, as well as the time off to rest. He immediately switches and says ""you're letting your 14 year old self decide this? I just don't want you to waste your money on something you'll regret."" and just kept continuing to what seemed like him trying to talk me out of it. I told him that saving money might make him happy, but I like to save my money for something I really want and then my joy is in getting said thing. I am fortunate enough to have parents who help me with paying for school, my car, and I still live with them, so they let me save my money to do what I want, but then they also do the same thing, and criticize me when I want to spend the money. It seems like it's never about what I want, it's always what everyone else wants. I thought my escape would be him, but he does it too, and when I kept telling him that it doesn't sound like he supports my decision he says ""I do support it I never said I didn't"". It's like he thinks that just because it says that, he can proceed to tell me how stupid of an idea it is for me to ""just throw my money at it because of how I felt 6 years ago"". I didn't feel like this only 6 years ago though, I've felt this constantly for the past 6 years, I want to be happy in my own body, I want to be able to not wear a bra and feel confident, I want to be able to wear the things I wouldn't buy now because I don't fill them in right. 

I always support him, no matter what, he has crazy dreams for his future career, and even sometimes when I think they may be unobtainable, I keep it to myself because I see how happy it makes him to talk about it. I let him talk my ear off about things that I could not care less about without saying anything because it makes him happy and I see the passion. I feel like he might never really see that what he does breaks my spirit, I don't know how else to try to explain it to him without him telling me I'm making a big deal out of nothing. Any suggestions, I don't want to be that person that says ""please dont say leave him"", I really do want honest opinions, because I don't know if this will ever change.

TL;DR Boyfriend constantly puts me down when I show interest in anything he disagrees with"
"My (25F) ex boyfriend (35M) has been spiraling into a depression and I am worried. My ex and I broke up in August. When we broke up, he was depressed, unemployed, unmotovated, addicted to video games, and was slowly selling his possessions to keep up with mortgage. Despite all of this, I stayed with him to try to encourage him to be a better version of himself, all the while holding myself back from doing things I've always wanted to do. We eventually broke up because of his infidelity. Even after the nasty break up, we still were on friendly terms.

A couple of days ago, out of the blue, he drunkenly messaged me heavily implying he is in a deeper hole than he was before. He sold his home and has been living off of that money since moving out. He was talking about how he feels like he is physically deteriorating and slowly dying. He admitted to me he is now addicted to certain hard drugs. I visited him today to make sure he is alright only to see that he is an absolute mess. He actually does look like he is deteriorating, his behavior is significantly different, and he has developed severe anger issues.

While we were together, his father and I were very close and he would call me to ask about my then boyfriend since he hardly ever spoke to him. I was seriously thinking about telling his father about his condition in hopes of getting him help. However, I don't want to betray him and bring unnecessary stress on him or his father. I'd seriously want him to get help but I have no idea how to. I tried so hard in the past to make sure he was taken care of, but it was incredibly exhausting and I have some big changes I need to focus on for now.

What should I do? Who should I talk to for help?"
"My boyfriend (21M) thinks I am gatekeeping addiction. (20F) Hi there. I'm gonna try to just tell things as they are and not talk so much about how I feel about it. I'm not very smart so please excuse any structural mistakes.

My boyfriend and I grew up differently. His parents are wonderful and loving, make good money, always took care of them and his life was just very normal growing up, I'm grateful for that. Nothing out of the ordinary except maybe not enough attention divided amongst siblings and I believe that has hurt him, but he's okay and loves his family. 

My whole life has been surrounded by addiction. Both of my parents, close cousins and uncles who all lived with me. My Father was a drug addict before I was ever born, I am the oldest. My mother was clean most of my childhood. It impacted and ruined my entire life. I have 2 younger siblings who are my world and were growing up. 
 
My father often abused my mother in front of me, cheated on her and would bring his women around us children, we were very neglected, he never worked ever, we had no money. My mom did her best. My dad let horrible people around me who did bad things to me and I never fought back to hope that it would spare my sister and brother. There were too many nights we could not eat, there would be no food, or I would not eat so my siblings could. I weighed 80-90 pounds consistently until I was 18. I had to drop out of school at the 5th grade because we were so poor my parents couldn't send both my sister and I to school. I never was able to take back my education. I have tried for my GED and was too stupid. 

There were many times we had no electricity, gas, or heat or water, I do not know if those are the same things but it was because we couldn't afford our bills. There were so many times I'd have to walk to find my Dad at drughouses and beg him to come home with even 1$ in his pocket so we could eat anything. I often had to fight with my dad, we both despised each other. I got the brunt of the abuse and neglect but I am okay with that. He would always yell awful things to me, to my mom, or I would have to get physical with him to get him off my mother, and many times huddle with my siblings to try to protect them from being sad when he would get arrested. I had PTSD but my parents wouldn't let me see a therapist so I couldn't tell anyone.

My mom soon became addicted, which hurt more. Even less money somehow, all of the childcare was on me, I had to grow up faster and went without more which is okay. She soon became abusive to me and hated me too for begging her to stop. She watched my uncle touch me in my room while being in the same room. It came to a head when she got arrested while I was home alone with the kids for possession of a drug and we all got separated into foster care hours away. Foster care was bad, but I'm lucky I aged out but I miss my siblings so much still. I don't get to see them often still. CPS hid my lack of education and never helped me. I'm lucky I got jobs but I'm not very smart.

My uncle took so many drugs he became schizophrenic, or it was dormant before the addiction, he lived with me too. He was now clean but I had to live with him not on his meds and protecting my siblings. He passed away from AIDS. My cousin too lived with us and was addicted and always stole my birthday money from my Papa or anything I was lucky to have to sell. 

I'm okay now! I love my family, both my parents are still hardcore addicts, maybe even worse but I love them from a distance. It hurts too much to see them nodding out from drugs or going to the bathroom as I visit to shoot up.

Sorry that was long.

My boyfriend and I were talking about my siblings visiting my parents and my sister sent me a video of my Dad being high and passing out on the couch. I said I wish dad wouldn't take so much. Boyfriend told me in response ""honestly i'd have snapped and told him ""i hate you because you're addicted to fucking drugs dude; im sick of this shit. ALL the FUCKING time. I don't even know my own dad anymore."""" He also said your expectation would be a reduction when you say that though  but the effect would be more profound to keep him clear or doing shit like this so often."" I told him expecting my Dad to get clean is useless, this is how he was before I was born, I am sorry but my Dad, and my mother, will die addicts. I said ""Do you think I have not done that before?"" I have told my father many times I hated him, plotted his death, told him to please get clean, or the hundred more times I'd bet him to come home so he could maybe steal something to eat because we had no money it all went to pills."" He said Sorry to me, and I said ""It's okay. You didn't mean anything, it's something you'll never be able to understand."" 

He took it personally and I feel bad for that. He said ""yeah.... you know my uncle was addicted to drugs and it caused him to be so paranoid he killed himself. and that whole situation is still very very surreal to me."" I asked if he was relating to me or trying to throw his experience in my face for saying he can't understand, he says both. 

My boyfriend was not close to his uncle. His uncle lived many states away, saw him every now and then on the holidays. His addiction never affected his immediate family (him, mom, dad, brother) until his death.I feel bad for him, his family, his uncle, I'm so sad for anyone addicted. I wish I could take it all away from everyone. But I do not think our situations are comparable. His uncle's addiction never once directly impeded his family, maybe his parents but he did not talk to him uncle, but his death did surely affected them all and it makes me sad. I told him in a paragraph how sorry I am for his uncle and his family, it was very long and detailed and heartfelt.

My boyfriend is now mad at me, he says ""i don't appreciate the eulogy after you gate kept my attempt to relate to you. im bitter now and im done talking to you."" 

It kind of feels like a slap in the face to have gone through what I have and have someone try to relate on the same level... I didn't mean to gatekeep if I did. But I just don't believe those situations are similar.

How do I fix this, or explain it to him? He won't talk to me and I feel bad. I think he had his intentions and I feel very bad. 

TL;DR My life was ravaged and ruined by living in a hole of addiction, a life of drugs, hunger, abuse, and foster care, my parents are still drug addicts and always will be. My boyfriend tried to relate with his uncle who was never in his life who killed himself due to drugs, and I told him it's not the same and he is mad at me, perhaps understandably."
"My boyfriend [20M] broke up with me[20F], How do I cool the burning sensation? I have been with this guy for nearly two years (he's my longest lasting relationship) and for the majority of that time, it's been great. Of course we had the occasional hiccups but there wasn't anything too remarkable that could be seen as detrimental, well at least I thought.

This morning he sends me a wall of text on snapchat saying in summary that we are nothing alike, I wanted kids he didn't, we have different senses of humor and that he can't see this lasting. I really loved him and could tell he was unhappy for the last week, I would ask about it but he wouldn't answer or he would just brush it off.  I was a bit upset that he broke the news to me on SC rather than calling or video calling me (we live in different cities and are under quarantine) but regardless, I understood and respected his feelings. I texted him back, wishing him all the best. 

For the first few hours after reading the wall of text, I was fine and went about my day. But later on in the evening, it felt like there was this weight on my chest and my heart was racing. The best way to describe it is that it felt like someone set me on fire. All of a sudden I was sobbing uncontrollably and all the fun and sweet memories we had together were running through my mind. 

I guess my question is how can I relieve/cope with this pain? Is this just the reality of the situation settling in? Would I have felt better if I had confronted him or something? How do I be more optimistic during this time?

Thanks for taking the time to read this."
"I (20M) broke up with my GF (20F) I felt that the relationship was starting to die and lose interest in each other. There was no fighting between us and   We have been together for 5 years, since freshman year of high school.  After breaking up, I feel like I made a mistake.  Should I try and make the relationship work, or just move on?"
"My bf cheated on me and I stayed with him, but now I think I’m ready to leave.. I (19F) am confused if I should stay in my relationship with my boyfriend (M22). Last year our relationship was rocky the first few months, completely toxic. I consider it the worst time of my life since I was physically unwell and recovering from surgery while also suffering from emotional pain. Our relationship started way too early it so it started off very rocky. About a few months in, my boyfriend visited his ex. He didn’t tell me for three weeks. He claims all that happened is that he brought food and ate with her and in the middle of everything he rushed back home (about an hour drive or so) because he realized what he was doing. He claims that nothing got physical and was conversation. 

This broke my heart. He was my first boyfriend so I felt like I wasted everything on him and was taken for granted, despite that it happened when I was recovering from a SBO. I’ve always felt like he didn’t care and that nothing he did was wrong. Every time I cried about it to him he would get defensive about it when all I wanted was an extra apology. The feelings of overbearing sorrow have led on throughout the months. 

Ten months past and I still get upset, I still cry about it. I would tell myself time will heal but apparently it hasn’t been doing it’s job. I love him so much and I appreciate our relationship but I’m so exhausted of crying. By the way, he doesn’t really take me on dates, buy me flowers even though I’ve mentioned I wanted some numerous times. He gets tired to drive an hour to come out and see me (he moved back with his family midway of our relationship), and will see me twice a month at best.  Hasn’t introduced me to his family even though he’s met mine. I feel like it’s not worth the tears but am I overreacting? Is it worth it? Do I stay or do I go?"
"My best friend blocked me and I miss her so much... So a back story to how it got to this is, we had been friends for seven years and she was my first, closest friend after being an outcast for so long. I was pretty possessive of her at first, wanting to be with her for everything and not given others a chance to partner with her (this was back when I was 12 lol) but later on I stopped and was opened myself up to more people rather than solely hold onto her because I didn't want to come off as some pushy aggressive friend and didn't want her to be put off by me

Two years ago, we were discussing something and eventually it led to me finding out she liked me. During this time she was extremely depressed as it was, cutting herself and all, and I thought if I told her I didn't like her it would ruin our friendship and it would have the worst possible outcome, so I lied. It was pretty easy to go through with it because we were extremely close but she began wanting to hold hands in public, kiss and I wasn't able to keep up with it because I didn't want to do those things because I'm not only straight, I'm also asexual so I don't exactly enjoy romance. 

I ended up confessing the truth and as expected she was extremely heartbroken but after explaining to her where I was coming from and apologising so many times I thought she forgave me. 

Fast forward to now, she went to a different school after she graduated but we stayed in touch through messages. I was going through a tough time with the people in my school who I had thought were my friends and my best friend seemed to talk less and less with me and leave often and the times we used to spend all night talking seemed non existent. 

One day she threw a birthday party for me, a small one with ""close"" friends (4 of us), and I had baked some cookies for her because I thought by doing this it would stop the distance growing between us. The day after, she told me she was supposed to tell me this during the party but felt bad because I had given cookies, but that she didn't feel for me me as much as she did before and that I still hold a place in her heart but we were more like long distant friends. And I sort of snapped, and replied pretty harshly saying she didn't need to put up an act that she didn't need to beat around the bush and could get straight to the point. And she didn't have to pretend to be my friend anymore and that I didn't need fake friends like the ones in my school. 

I ended up getting blocked, and after cooling down I realised I was in the wrong and reached out through other social medias and such but she kept blocking me. On her last account she sent me a message saying that I made the seven years of her life miserable and that if I was a good friend I wouldn't have lied. And that she felt that she couldn't live without me, and how it was only after she left the school that she realised that I was toxic and that she had given me so many chances and how even if she let me crawl back again she didn't want to return to those seven years. She also said there were so many more reasons but that if she told me them, it would sound really petty. She ended it saying she wants me out of her life for good.

Its been a few months since then, I tried emailing her apologising for everything and explaining how I never knew I made her miserable and she never told me anything, and I never was given any chances - at least not that I knew of. I researched into what a toxic friend was and I said I'm sorry for being one although even now I truly don't see how I was toxic.. I was always there for her as an emotional support when she would be down even when I would feel upset that she was upset over me getting a good grade rather than congratulating me. I understood where she was coming from.. there was even a time where I flunked on purpose for her and although it stang I smiled and congratulated her for scoring higher than me and the best in class. 

I've tried making new friends though it's hard because of coronavirus so it's online, but I can't help but feel extremely miserable and down. Everything reminds me of her, from simply drawing to just watching movies... I see things and am like oh that's just like me and her or at least.. was and get the urge to send it to her but realise she's not there anymore... 

I don't know how to deal with it. Sometimes I wish I never knew her, I would've been a loner without her and maybe it would have been better that way... There were four of us including me and her. One of them blocked me soon after though we never spoke much and I don't know why she did, and another who keeps telling me to think about what I did wrong and says how my best friend cared deeply about me and that I must have done something wrong and that I should just move on already but regardless of how much sleep I lose over it I just don't know.. and I wonder to myself that if I really did matter so much to her, how was she able to push me away so easily...

I just need some advice on how to deal with this, I have no one to talk to or turn to, just like that I lost everything. The people I thought were friends don't even look at me and don't care about me as much as I do for them and I have no one to pour my heart out to, and it just hurts so much. 

Yes I have a family but my dad left recently (been a month) because we have family issues and my mum's not... Very supportive. I spoke about the issue to her but now whenever she's angry at me she ends up bringing it up like how I definitely was the one who made my best friend's life miserable and she would say things like oh I shouldn't say anything or you'll go kill yourself the one time I told her I was genuinely depressed. it really hurts and I hate it and I told her but she doesn't really xare. And my brothers are.. well you get the idea 😅 ah as for why my mum gets angry its if for example I forget to put a spoon away or something small, just one little mistake amidst all the good things I did that she fails notice. She has a very very short temper and the littlest things like me staying up late on my phone can result in her doing questionable things as a parent. That's understandable if I was a little kid I guess but Ill be an adult next year.

And so that's why I can't talk to my family about this... It makes me stressed and adds onto this rather than making me feel better...

I changed phones because my other one broke and numbers and I'm tempted to message my best friend to try one more time... but I'm so scared.. I don't know.."
"My ex/childhood sweetheart (F27) has reached out to me (M27). We could get back together after 10 years, what do I do?! Hello Reddit (first time posting in here). 

Me and my ex recently got back in touch after discovering we both have ended up living in the same city at the same time by chance (we both move around and travel a lot). We’ve been talking a lot recently and getting to know each other slowly again and I can tell she still has feelings for me and would be willing to take it further.

We dated for 3 years as teenagers between ages 14-17, so we separated 10 years ago. She was my first ever girlfriend, I lost my virginity to her etc. We ended on not ideal terms but we were both pretty wayward kids with no clue in the world about how to handle a serious relationship. We both contacted each other a few times here and there over the past decade but nothing substantial until now.

Having spoke to her recently it seems apparent we are on the same page in life and have both matured and developed a lot in the past decade. We seem to be looking for similar things in life - stability, and someone to grow with. But also we are both VERY impulsive characters. 

I never really considered this would happen so I stopped longing for her about a year after we split up and moved on. I’ve been in a few relationships since that didn’t quite work out but I’m wondering whether this could turn into something more and whether to actively try and take it to the next level. 

She is awesome. She’s very kind, a big ball of energy and has a huge heart of gold. 

I am reluctant because I am afraid it could fail and I will lose her as a friend forever but also because I’ve been through a lot of shitty relationships in the past. 

Am I being too idealistic? Should I just go for it. Should I run in the opposite direction. I have no idea what the hell to do. Pls help!!!

PS sorry if my grammar sucks, I’m not the best at writing!"
"My boyfriend wants me to see a therapist? So lately I’ve just been going through some stuff. Mostly school related (I’m in my last year of university), idk. I just feel like all my life bad things always happen to me for no reason. Anyway I get frustrated a lot and sometimes take it out on him, and I never mean to, I love him so much. I always apologize of course if I ever do that but he said I should consider seeing a therapist? I’m confused for several reasons. 
For one, I think most of my being frustrated is justifiable since like I said, bad things just keep happening to me for no reason, and I’m constantly stressed. I feel it’s unfair he just expects me to be happy all the time. I told him that his life is much better than mine, and as a result he’s happy, and he just said I shouldn’t think that about anyone. However it’s true, he has a loving family and many friends who care about him, my mom is very strict and harsh with me and I don’t have any friends because I’m just not good at making them, I live alone by myself and he lives with his parents and doesn’t have to work, or deal with the stress of university. 
(Actually now that I think about it he did attend university at one point and it made him REALLY stressed and i was always there for him when he needed me and never suggested a therapist) 
Second of all shouldn’t he as my lover support me and love me instead of basically telling me I should let some stranger deal with my problems? I would support him if he ever had any problems and be understanding, but like I said, he never does because his life is great.
I really just want his love and support, and a therapist can’t give me that. Also I just don’t think a therapist can help me. It’s not like I’m upset for no reason, it’s because of stressful things happening to me, and a therapist can’t just fix them. Before they started I was super happy and me and my boyfriend were doing great. Also not to mention I do not feel comfortable at all sharing my personal life with a total stranger, I’m usually very reserved about my issues except for telling him and my family. 
So yeah, I just don’t see why he can’t give me love and support, that’s all I want. It’s almost like he’s saying “I don’t wanna deal with your crap, take it to someone else, I only like you when you’re happy.” I just feel like as my partner, helping each other when one of us is going through problems is something we should both do..
Thoughts?
Update: thank you everyone for your input. When I wrote this post i was really upset with my boyfriend because I thought he didn’t care enough about me to want to help me, but now I understand he actually was trying to help by suggesting I see a therapist. I will keep that option in mind in case things continue to be stressful."
"I dont like my best friends boyfriend Id like to add i am a female and so is my best friend

Anyways i found out that he went through our text messages on her phone and i feel like my privacy was invaded cause he read things that i would've liked to keep between me and her. Anyways at the time i was extremely depressed and missed having girl time and haning with my bestie. But im just now thinking if he read those messages that means he knew i was upset and knew i wanted more time with her. So to me i feel like he then wanted her to give him all her attention so she wouldn't focus on me. Now the only times i get with her are they days he works cause hes been living with us and i honest to god fucking hate that hes here. Id also like to add i did write something yesterday about him. He told her it is disrespectful to sleep in the same bed as me when shes in a relationship and that were grown woman and dont need to be in the same bed together. When i tell you i was pissed i was livid. 


He tried to talk to me tonight like we're all buddy buddy but we're not i have absolutely no respect for the kid i am done done."
"Low selfesteem keeps thinking about toxic relationship This is my first message ever here. I've been reading your story's for a long time  and felt the need to share for some advice!

After being single for a long time -7 years- I was ready to open up again. I met this guy who was a lot younger but blow me away from the moment we spoke.

Or date was great and I have never felt so comfortable with anyone.
A lot of dates followed and quickly we were together!

Aldo we had completely different lives (I worked, had lived together before, had a long relationship) (he was a student, never has a relationship), we matched like crazy.
He was the man I wanted; his jealousy made me feel worthy and loved and protected. And I would do literally anything for him.

Long story short. I DID everything for him and he broke me completely. It was difficult for him to open up and, out of self protection, he hurt the ones that are close (his words). 

I was patient and give him his time to explore to let him go out alone, use drugs, hormones, chat private with girls.

I kept on hoping and wishing that he would realize that he has to seek the love in me and not in random girls. But I guess he didn't.

At a point when we had a argument, he left for some weeks and deleted our relationship, photos, blocked me everywhere and left me alone, wondering.

Because of my low self esteem I just blamed myself so many things. It took some months when he got back in touch with me again. And stupid me, who still loved him, opend up carefully.

Same shit happened again. Even worse. Because of him I almost lost my whole life; my job, everything, because of blackmailing. I was scarred of him, of what he might do. 

Now I'm here again, crying my eyes out on the couch. Blaming myself that I've let him in, that I dont see my value, that I'm still waiting for answers. Answers and apologies that never come.

I deleted all my social media because it hurts to much to see him. I still see my man in him and wish I could change him to open up, quit the narcistic bullshit and just love and let love. Deep down I know I can't and I shouldn't.

It was such a bittersweet relationship with deep, deep, lows but also great highs.
It is addicting in a way. And hard to get out.

I never had a loving man figure in my live and the relationship with my self due to some trauma is low. I accept a lot because I dont see my value. 

So my question for those who were in a toxic relationship and hear what I'm saying; Please let me know how to move on. Please let me know how to start listening to your head.
Please let me know if you ever had a loving relationship when having low self esteem.

I'm just so alone right now with my thoughts. 

Thank you for 'listening'"
"Long Read - 28F Trying to get out of an abusive relationship w/ 25M, TW:abuse/cheating This is going to be long, I'm sorry.

I've been with the same person, on and off, for four years.  He has cheated at least a half a dozen times, he's left me several, the most recent and longest being for five months.  I know, stupid, why don't I leave?  Unfortunately, some of us know that it isn't that simple.

I was groomed for abuse.  My parents were abusive growing up, and it's lead to quite the forgive and (not entirely) forget mentality.  I have a very frustrating inability to stay angry, my mind compartmentalizes abuse after it empathizes.  As in, I end up thinking okay, you're only human I can see why you did this and then it kind of disappears.  I just want to move on and be happy, so I let it go the best I can.  I also have a tendency to black out many instances of abuse and cheating, so I am very rarely ever seeing the full picture.  I'll remember this years' cheating, but I won't ever be thinking about the years' prior.

He even cheated on me on my birthday.. he went to a party for a friend leaving for the military and I had to work, he knew I was upset and we fought at one point.  He didn't try to contact me until after midnight that night, hours after I got home.  We fought, I ended up logging into his messenger and saw he messaged someone he's never spoken to before asking to hang out saying he's 'never had the courage to talk to her before' then I logged onto his tinder, he had several new matches and two new conversations.  On. My. Birthday.

I finally got the strength to leave.  FINALLY, but I've engaged in toxic behaviors since then.  I've messaged him, angrily, telling him I hate him, trying to get any reaction, trying to get him to show some type of caring that was never there when we were together.  I nag, and I accuse, and I hover, even though I left this person.  I know this is wrong but some part of me just needs him to care? I don't know.  A lot of me wants him to suffer like I am, and it makes me so angry that he isn't.  We split up and he starts partying, sleeping around, living it up.  It makes me so angry, I sit here and cry for weeks on end when he leaves.

I mentioned him being on Tinder back in March and he swore up and down that he wasn't.. so in response he went and logged back immediately after crying to me that he wasn't on it back then and started swiping.  Even paid for Tinder Gold and said well if you're going to accuse me I might as well do it.

A little more back story aside from the cheating.  I say abusive, but what exactly does that mean?  Well, he's very proficient in gaslighting.  The comment that broke the camels back was ""well we both can get up then"" in a snarky tone, in response to me simply saying my daughter (not his) would behave better with less electronics and more attention from both of us.  On the phone days later he said he didn't really know why he got kicked out, just that he asked for help with my daughter and I got angry.  He always paints himself as the victim after the fact, and while he's doing it he tells me that I treat him like a child for reprimanding him for being rude or snarky, and that if I just acted differently, etc.  He has even said ""I know you don't like how harshly I parent but if you just let me finish what I'm saying/doing and then pull me aside after it won't turn into an argument"" as if I should sit there and listen to my child being yelled at for spilling a drink on the floor or making another simple mistake.  I can't do it.

It isn't just the snarky comments, he's rude about everything.  He has such a negative outlook on people and life.  I'm usually a vibrant person, I go to bars alone and make friends, I get up in front of strangers and sing at open mics, I put myself out there.  I go on adventures, I have dreams, ambitions, I get shit done.  I am an awesome person without him.  When we're together all I want to do is sleep.  My mind gets so foggy that I can barely tell left from right, let alone carry on with life.  My friends fully expect to never hear from me when he's around, they know I just disappear.  I'm so attached, yet he guts everything that makes me me.  It wasn't always like this, he was my best friend.  

He even makes me a bad mother.  I don't even interact with my 7 year old daughter on a daily basis when he's around.  I can't be bothered to do anything but try to escape reality.  My relationship with her flourishes when he's gone - this is the main thing that pushed me to leave him this time.  She deserves better.

This has turned physical on a couple occasions.  A few weeks ago he wouldn't stop yelling mid argument so I said I would call the cops.  He grabbed my phone, threw it and said ""I have no problem breaking another phone"" and when I went for the door to go grab a neighbor he grabbed me in a bear hug while I was kicking and screaming for me to let him go.  He finally did when I punched him in the face and split his lip open... he referred to this in another argument simply as ""oh yeah when you punched me in the face?""

I have deep trauma bonds with this person.   I have lifelong psychological trauma and I'm trying like hell to be better, but something about being left just makes me snap and I act like a child.  He knows this, so when he ignores me or starts talking to other women after we split he knows he'll get a reaction from me.  Then he turns that reaction into ammo: he demands better treatment and says well you told me it's done so what else do you want me to do? You're not going to block me or tell me to fuck off or tell me you don't want to talk to me or that's exactly what I'll do.  He knows if he hurts me enough he can bully me into begging for him to come back and just be nicer to me.  He did it to me earlier tonight, he was with out mutual friends and he screamed at me on the phone while I cried because he was being so mean, saying he shouldn't have to sit on the phone with me while his friends are inside.

I get it, I'm also being toxic.  I don't want to be.  I want to be better, and I want to move on and eventually form a healthy relationship.  I don't know how to even begin breaking my attachments to this toxic person.  I need a therapist, but I'm not sure how long it will take me to get one.  I live in New York state, everything is shut down.

He knows if he waits long enough I'll give him a hard time but I'll eventually let him right back in... I need to stop doing this.  My child's well being, my life, everything depends on it.  I need to stop this toxic back and forth, and this bullshit belief that I need him or that I won't find anyone that I can be as comfortable with or have as much in common with.

Has anyone been here before?  How did you let go?  How did you break the emotional attachment?  How can I break this?"
"Deleting pictures of my ex and I Some back story: My ex (23M) and I (22F) broke up over a year ago but i still have a lot of photos, videos, and snapchat memories saved on my phone from when we dated. We dated for about two years. Although my relationship with him had a lot of toxicity, I cherish the (good) memories i have with him. We did a lot together, went on a lot of trips, and I would see him at least two to three times a week. Despite all the bad, I try to focus on the good. After I broke up with him, It took about a year to completely get over him. I’m now dating someone (22M) else and I’ve decided to go through all my photos/videos, etc. that i have with my ex to delete them but i find myself holding back. I don’t understand why? I can truly say i love the person i am dating now and i want a future with him.. so why can’t i delete these pictures? 
I keep thinking that by deleting these pictures I’m deleting memories and in all honesty, despite what happened between my ex and i, i still enjoy the good memories. Like i said, we did a lot together and those trips hold lots of good moments. Plus, thats two years of my life in images and video. I know keeping the pictures would upset the person im currently dating, i dont want him to think i miss my ex (which i 100% dont). For me, those days were just good and I don’t want to forget the good.. if that makes sense? I dont know... maybe im being ridiculous but i guess im coming here to ask for advice. 
Should i just delete them? Why do am i holding back on doing so? If you’ve been in this situation before, what did you do?

Summary: Im currently dating someone and i find myself holding back on deleting images and videos of my ex and I from things and trips we did together."
"My girlfriend cannot feel any emotions and thinks that she's depressed, what should I do? So, I (14M) have a girlfriend (14F) we love each other alot and have had lots of firsts together. We were together for about 4 months before she moved away. We are still together, but recently she has been getting depressed and we don't know why. She has been giving hints that she might cause harm to herself. Today's she texted me that now she doesn't feel any emotions. She said that she cannot feel happiness or sadness. I don't think she has been diagnosed with it yet. She is scared of this feeling. And I'm just generally scared that she will harm herself. I also think that she is getting suicidal thoughts. I have started to get those same thoughts, but that's because of stress. I tried talking to my friends about it, but they just tell me to man up. She also keeps saying that ""I'm too far gone for your help"". But yeah, any advice to help her? I am very concerned about her. I don't know how to help her. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"My boyfriend’s father is insensitive and overworks him while also taking it out on me Okay so I(18f) live with my boyfriend, Matt(20m) and we’ve lived together for the three of the five months we’ve been together. 

Whenever my boyfriend is late for work his dad starts calling and texting me (matt works with his dad) and today, my boyfriend was five minutes late because he had slept in. Basically I kept him up last night because I had a breakdown that was really bad and it lasted until 2/ 2:30 in the morning.

Well, because of that, Matt was late and his dad started calling me and texting me while I was still asleep (not unusual). He called me six times with four messages within a 10 minute time period. When I woke up I apologized to him for not answering and he immediately started bitching about how Matt is late to work a lot. Which let me clarify when I say he’s late, he’s only ever late by 2 to 5 minutes and where I’m from a lot of stores have a grace period that if you’re late 10 minutes it doesn’t matter. But today was my fault and I admitted it to him and his response was something like “well I don’t wanna be a dick but he still needs to be to work on time even if you’re up all night crying. You both need to get your shit together”

His father is extremely insensitive and only seems to care about work. He will keep Matt at work until 7-8 o’clock at night even though he goes into work at 7AM and is supposed to be home by 5PM. On days Matt has off his dad will call him and make him go to the store for him or make matt go to his house to help him all while saying it’s for work but never ends up paying him for what he does on his free time. Matts father takes a lot of the help I need from him away from me and he’s just generally an ass. I’m not sure what to do because I don’t want to upset my boyfriend but I also want their relationship to be healthy, not all about work. Any suggestions?

Edit: this is not a normal job. Matt goes to his fathers house in the morning. it’s not a store, it’s not a clients house. it’s his fathers house and every day Matt shows up, his dad’s not even ready or out of his pajamas yet

Edit 2: I understand that my boyfriend should never be late. I am not blind to the fact it is wrong. There have been many times that I have talked to him about being late so often BUT everyone is only clinging to the fact it is wrong he’s late. I want to know what I can do about his dad being a dick to me and being a shitty parent to his son. There is much more his father does and says and none of this is a one time thing. The name-calling and the belittling is an every day thing that his father does to him and myself"
"It would have been gone a long time ago. Accusing me of taking something of value, he get drunk and puts things in random places. I try to help him remember. But after hours of looking he looks at me and said you where the last one to have it. That hurt. If I wanted his stuff it would have been long gone. Why to make me look like shit. I’m out"
"Foster sister (15F) is out of control and I (22F) don't know how to help her My parents decided to foster a 15 year old girl, her name is Olivia (fake name). She moved in with us in February. At the beginning I didn't talked to her a lot because I was never home, I was either at school or at work. Things got difficult very fast, after being with us for around 2 weeks she asked me if I could drive her to the mall since she wanted to meet with some friends. I dropped her off at the mall at 2:00p.m and she was supposed to text me to let me know when she wanted me to pick her up. I texted her a couple of times throughout the day but it wasn't until 10:00p.m that she asked me if I could come pick her up from her friends house 45 minutes away from the mall. I was very upset because she only had permission to go to the mall, not to her friends house. I was upset but I drove all the way to her friend's house to pick her up. A week later, on a Friday,  she asked my parents if she could go to a friends house. My parents told her her she needed to be back home by 9:00p.m, well it was 11:00p.m. and she was nowhere to be found and she was not answering her phone. It wasn't until Sunday that she got in contact with my parents to ask them if they could come pick her up from her friends house 1 hour away from home. My parents were very angry but they were trying to be understanding, they believed that she just needed to get adjusted to my parents rules. 

After those 2 incidents things have only gotten worse, she leaves the house without letting anyone know where she is going. She would text me at 11:00p.m letting me know that she is at a friends house and will be staying the night because she doesn't have a ride back home. She has been staying at friends houses and comes back home whenever she feels like it. Last week she left and called me at 10:00 pm asking if I could come pick her from a motel!! she told me she was supposed to be meeting a friend there but that he never showed up, I told my mother and we went to pick her up. My mother yelled at her for being in a motel but Olivia said that she never went inside but she was only waiting outside for her friend. On Monday she left to a friends house without asking for permission once again and didn't come back until Tuesday at 8:00am the following day. She doesn't have a house key so every time she is ready to come back home she calls me to open the door for her. She is not allowed to leave the house anymore because my parents have punished her but she snuck out of the house a couple of hours ago at 1:00am. She is probably going to come back tomorrow acting like nothing happen and expect for me to open the door for her. Lets not even talk about how she doesn't even care that my mother has high blood pressure and we are all staying at home due to the virus. She just doesn't care about potentially getting my parents sick because she refuses to stay at home. I Found her Facebook and her Instagram accounts, she follows a lot of NSFW pages and I think she is just having sex with all these guys she goes out to meet. I  have tried talking to her but she just doesn't listen. My parents think it would be better if she goes back to the foster care agency because she is just not listening to anyone's advice. Should I tried talking to her again? how can I get her to understand that what she is doing is unacceptable? or should I just ley my parents handle it and take her back to maybe a different foster home? I just cant help it but feel bad for her, I know she has gone through a lot at such a young age. I wanted to be a good role model for her but I don't know if I should even try."
"I feel like I’m constantly put on the back burner I tend to meet guys once or twice and then they lose interest. It’s weird because we’ll have a great time together, I’m great at holding a conversation, and they’ll even say they want to meet up again but then...crickets. I get the feeling like it might be because I’m a 7. I’m cute enough that they could settle but they really want to push for at least an 8. How can I keep them wanting to come back? I’m getting tired of cycling through people and I feel like soon I won’t have anyone around."
"My wife [55] is addicted to Facebook! She got the app back in 2013 and within months it became a huge issue. Since my kids were teens then, she had a lot of time on her hands because they did all their chores and took care of themselves mostly.  It started becoming a problem when we would come back from places and within seconds of entering the door she was already posting or scrolling through her feed. I thought she was just using it to catch up with old friends or talk to relatives but she’s on it more than they are. 

Dinners at nice restaurants would involve her checking her phone every 2-3 minutes while the kids weren’t even allowed to use their own phones. Family photos would instantly be uploaded and posted before I even put down the camera. At social events all she can talk about is Facebook and 90% of the time she is on Facebook. 

One time that really set me off was when she posted about our son’s acceptance to college before he even got the chance to call his relatives personally to tell them, not from a Facebook post. Whenever I tried to confront her she tries to deny it and yells at me for being on my phone when I have work related emails, calls, messages, etc to take care of.  Late night movies together or even simply bonding has to have Facebook involved. 

As my kids moved out, her days consumed of showering and then sitting on the couch scrolling the whole day while I was at work. I suggested picking up a new hobby or making some new friends but then she tries to pin it on me on how I’m not social enough or I don’t have anything to do ether while I go to work all day."
"I think my crush (13F) likes me (13F) back, but I'm not sure I should ask her out. I have observed several signs that she likes me back, but her friends all say she doesn't like anyone. But that could be a lie, because her friends are always going around trying to find out who likes her, and she herself hasn't said anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we are both girls, and I don't know her sexuality. I am bisexual btw. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any suggestions...?"
ThrowRA my partner f30 finds a lot of validation through texts and gets upset if I go too long without reading or responding We’ve been together for 2 1/2 years and we’re past that beginning stages where texting can be a great form of communication. But after almost 3 years if I didn’t respond to her text right away I’m being told I’m inconsiderate that I can’t make the time to open and respond to a text when she sends it. But I didn’t text back because I fell asleep and then installed a window ac and didn’t look at my phone. And she was at work and I was home and we were texting back and forth from 9am to 3pm and I forget for 2 hours and now I’m being made to feel guilty about it
"I love my wife, but I don't like her My wife (27 F) has exhausted me over 3 years of marriage. She has been somehow selfish, stubborn and stupid. She pushes our relationship in direction to be like ""flat mates with sexual activities"".
I used to bare all this as she used to be a good partner before we started living together, proactive and somehow supporting. However, she was unfaithful once under the influence of alcohol (had sex with another girl while I was away at work).
This was a turning point in our lives, I am trying to move on and accept this mistake, but she is not helping at all. I always tell her what bothers me and how to fix things but she is acting like stupid. I donot trust her at all even in small things ; like when I ask her to put my phone on charger, she just plugs the socket in the phone while its unplugged from power source she does not even take a look if a freaking small mission like this accomplished. She is careless to the utmost, and she does not care about me with her actions, only words.
Yet, I still feel like I love her and I wish she changes.
What is the problem here?I m really helpless. This is not the type of relationship I m looking for, I won't trust her if we decide to have a baby, I do not trust her ability to accomplish, decide or even reason like a normal human being."
"Does my wife's body shaming count as concern for my health? This is super long so sorry for that. TL/DR: My wife has really high physical standards and puts my (and her) body down a lot in the name of health. Should I change myself to match what she wants or is she projecting insecurity onto me? If the latter, how do I work through this stuff with her?

My (M29) wife (F30) and I have been together for going on 8 years (married for almost 7). I'm from the United States and she's from Brasil so we grew up in different cultures. This is generally not too big of an issue as we have been able to blend our backgrounds together into a unique way of life all our own. However, there are times it can cause issues, and this is one that has been bothering me a bit for a while.

Let me be clear, this is not a bash session on my wife. She's an awesome woman who has given so much to this relationship, and I know I'm not perfect by any stretch. There is something though that has pretty consistently rubbed me the wrong way and really messed with my self-esteem. In her mind, the ideal human body is essentially what you see with any model. Abs, rail-thin, tall, big breasts, big butt, toned muscles, perfect hair/eyes/skin etc. Most of the time this manifests itself in how she looks at and talks about herself (a constant battle is me having to repeatedly tell her she doesn't have to live up to these intense standards and how she is legitimately beautiful). This woman grew up in a home where her parents would constantly remind her that she was ""chubby"" or tell her not to eat so much. My wife is about 5'2"" and fluctuates from 120-130 lbs depending on what may be going on with her body. And this is after 3 pregnancies. She's perfectly normal and nowhere near any level of obesity. However, not a day goes by without her talking about how ""huge"" her belly is or something to that effect. She even gets upset if I don't buy into her desire to change her body. She was completely shocked when I said I didn't want her to get breast implants (she suggested this for my benefit). I made it clear if she did, she should do it for her, but I was (and am) more than happy with her current body.

So clearly there are some issues there and I've been trying to work through them with her, but I'm struggling with her application of these standards to me. I am 6'1"" 250 with about a 38"" waist. Always been a big guy, but I have never been overly obese either. Played sports a lot growing up, work out and run regularly, and I even have a job where I am literally required to stay in decent shape. I have definitely never been the six-pack, chiseled body builder, but I am still far from fat or unhealthy. I don't get sick often at all, have good blood pressure, don't smoke and only occasionally drink, and have no significant health issues. I just go to the doctor for annual checkups where they tell me I'm the picture of health. My eating habits have changed significantly over the years as I eat less now that my metabolism has slowed, but I still largely eat whatever I want. I focus on portion control and limiting extra eating. Since we've known each other I've gained probably 15 pounds. For most of our relationship I have been in the 240-250 range. Since almost the beginning, she has made comments about my body. Lately they have gotten more common and pointed. 

Among the things she has said:
- I think you should get a six-pack.
- You used to be so skinny (referring to me in high school when I was 205).
- You need to lose this (usually tapping my stomach or waist in some area).
- You shouldn't eat/drink that.
- You look fat.
- Have you gained weight?
- I want to see what you would look like ripped.
- I don't think you are healthy. You're going to die young.

I have repeatedly made it clear to her that I'm pretty happy with my body for most part. I could probably lose some fat around my midsection, but it isn't having a huge impact on my life. I also do not have any desire to put the work and sacrifice into having the body-type she thinks is ideal. I have been around long enough to know that six-pack does not equal health. I make this clear to her often (even at my skinniest, I've never had a six-pack), but she maintains she says this stuff out of concern for my health. There is only one healthy body type in her world. When I point out how, in many ways, I have above-average health, she dismisses me as just making excuses. She constantly compares both of us negatively to various celebrities. It's to a point where I am questioning myself and my own security in my body. I basically question every decision having to do with my diet or exercise as I am now hyper-aware that if I slip a little she might not take it well. I would buy the whole ""health concern"" piece if every critique she had wasn't just based on appearance. It makes me feel like she doesn't actually care about my health, just that I look ""good.""

Anyways, all of that to say, is there anything I can/should do to help her relax these standards that have been ingrained into her? Am I just being sensitive? Do I just need to only eat salads and give her the body she wants for me? I don't really blame her (for the love of God please do not turn this into a forum for talking about my wife negatively) because she grew up being taught this stuff, but it has a ton of negative effects on both of us. I try to be patient and just repeat that she is good enough just as she is, but I have a harder time defending myself than I do reassuring her. 

I love her, how can I help her with this stuff?"
I did a lot of looking around for traits! Why do I only find things about toxic relationships when reading about relationships? Why do I only find the negative and not the positive? Care to explain this?
"I'm [22M] not too sure how I feel about my current relationship. I'm in a relationship about 9 months after the end of my last one. She cheated, we were together for multiple years it really hurt. Came at a rough time in my life, found out I was depressed, was taken off of work, and a family member died all in the same few days. I think it's safe to say that I'm nowhere near the person I was at the end of that relationship. 

Anyways now I'm in this relationship for the last 3 months but I'm starting to feel off. I know that it's not her fault at all and I'm still affected by my last relationship. I do not have feelings for my ex. I feel the betrayal and the pain but not the love. But it's really starting to mess with me, as though like I'm starting to feel like I'm not capable of truly loving right now. I feel strongly for this girl and any thoughts of ending things are far from my mind, but I'm not sure how to proceed. I'd very much like to talk to her about this but I'd rather be a little more ready for that conversation. 

I just need some sort of advice as to what to do. Is this feeling normal? Is it something ill be able to work past or did I rush into things with her?"
"Is it my (24F) hormones right now or am I a little bit right to feel like this? Hey, for context I am currently 24w+5 pregnant so idk if its my hormones or not. 

My husband came to the room saying “My dad wants to see me and my best friend is gunna be there so I’m gunna go. Best friend is waiting at the top of the driveway for me” 

I replied saying thats okay, a little hurt coz i was looking forward to our takeout &amp; movie night as we were busy today. He must have seen i was slightly disappointed and was like “i mean, come if you want” - but here i am in my comfy clothes, no make up, hair a mess and I’m like well.. i cant because your friend is already here to pick you up? So i dont have any time to get ready. So idk he left.

I texted him just saying to let me know if he’ll need me to get him dinner or if he was eating there and to have fun. He must be feeling guilty coz he said again “come if you want” and idk guys like for me that just made me feel like an afterthought and he didnt really want me there but he felt obligated to say that :/ so i just said “look, theres a difference of come if you want and we’d like you to come” coz to me i dont want to be somewhere, where i would feel like i am a third wheel or where i wasnt really invited in the first place. This happens as well when he goes to the pub with his dad and other couples are there. It feels weird for him to go without me and then say “come if you want”.  Why would I show up later? I feel like it wouldnlook like i forced him to invite me. i feel like he knows how it will make me feel and that I wont end up going anyways

Is it wrong for me to feel like I wasn’t really wanted there? I cant tell coz hormones so i just wanted some outside perspective. 

Tl;dr i feel hurt my husband half-assed invited me out which made it seem like he didnt want me there."
"I don’t know how to open up to people anymore Hello everyone . I will try to keep it short, I just feel like I need some advice or moral support. I (21F) was dating a guy (23) for a bit less than a year. Everything was great , he really appreciated me in his life and was constantly saying how he is looking forward to our next dates , calls, texts etc.. I didn’t really trust his words at first because I was hurt many times before and was just scared to fell for someone again. Also I struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem and I always feel like I am no good for anyone and there is nothing special about me, but he was saying that it didn’t matter to him and he thinks I am good just the way I am . I met his parents, aunt, close friends; he was saying how he wants me and him to move in together. So I started to open up to him and eventually fell in love. I finally felt so happy thinking that he is the one. And that when everything kinda changed.  Long story short , he started to act weird, he said he doesn’t see a future with me, that he always compares this relationship to the first one he had ( which was very toxic but he said that he experienced deep love with the girl ). Basically he said casually he doesn’t experience strong feelings towards me.. we broke up today, and his words” I don’t love you today. Actually I don’t love you most days” 

So.. honestly .. I don’t know how I can trust people , it was so hard to open up and when I finally did it felt as he stabbed me in the back  
Sorry for the grammar mistakes, English is not my first language . 

Thank you for reading, I hope you are loved"
"How can I [19 M] be a better boyfriend in future relationships? For a little backstory, I’m 19 and I’ve been in one relationship, which was last year. It was short but only because of some external circumstances. Seeing as it was my first relationship, I don’t think I was the best boyfriend I could’ve been. I showed that I cared, complimented her, listened to her, and all that. I don’t think I did a bad job at all of being a boyfriend but I did make some mistakes because of my lack of experience. 

I just want to be better for any future relationships. I want to be a boyfriend that a girl would appreciate and all that. So that leads me here. I know being kind, understanding, and all that is important but are there any other things I should keep in mind? Anything you guys have learned through your experiences that you can share with me? Like I said, in the future, I just wanna be the best partner I can be."
"How do I (45M) let my daughter (16) know that she wasn’t a “mistake” or an “accident”? So me and my wife (43F) have 3 wonderful children, our oldest is our daughter who we’ll call Jane, which I’ll talk about in a second but first some background. 

Me and my wife started dating when she was 19 and I was 21 in college. We were both study pre-med type majors with aspirations to become doctors. I ended up dropping out of that major due to personal stuff keeping me from focusing on my studies and a general disinterest for my major. I got an associates degree in a more technical field and got a job that paid well enough just 1.5 years later at 23. 

At this point me and my wife moved in and within a year we knew we were eventually going to get married and have children. Also my wife was KILLING it in school, she was on track to finish her education and become a doctor at age 30. 

Because of this we decided we would wait to have kids until she finished school and we got a house, which we projected we be when she was about 31-32 years old. I would then become a stay at home dad and raise the kids full time. 

Well when my wife was 27, she got pregnant with our daughter. Technically it was unplanned but we were both very excited and happy to start a family together, albeit a little stressed because she still had to finish her schooling and I would still have to work so raising the baby would be a little harder than planned. A little more inconvenient than intended but very much worth it. Wife then finished school and became a doctor 3 years later, I was able to quit work and be a parent full time. 16 years later and were a big happy family; eat together, play board games together, do hobbies together etc. Life is wonderful. 

Well yesterday my oldest Jane was talking to my wife about medical school and the education path of becoming a doctor, and while they were were talking Jane asked “why did you have me in the middle of medical school, wouldn’t it have been easier to wait.”

Me and my wife both didn’t really know how to answer that question as we hadn’t really thought of it like that in years so both kinda stuttered and gave “um, uh” sort of answers. When we said this the mood of Jane’s face immediate got gloomier, and she said “you guys didn’t plan on having me did you?” Again me and my wife were taken aback, so we didn’t give an instant rebuttal and Jane took this as a yes and got really sad for the rest of the day. 

We went up and talked to her and told her about her birth and how much we love her and how she’s the best thing to ever happen to us but she’s still a little gloomy today and I can tell it’s kind of bothering her. 

How can I go about making her feel better? Should I give her space or reassure her that while she may have not been planned, she was in no way a mistake?"
"[Dating a divorced man] My date (37M) and I (30F) have done all relationship- be- like things but he doesn’t want to commit yet I can’t call him my “boyfriend” and he never introduces me to anyone under “girlfriend” tag, always “friend” so I call him “my date” here as I don’t know any other label for this. 

We have been dating for 1 year. We like each other since the 1st day we met and told each other our feelings then. 

We met friends and families of each other. He was the one who initiated plans to meet my friends, my family then his family, his friends. He was always excited to do that and made efforts to make the best impression to my friends and families and also help me to create good impression to his friends and families. 

We both get along well with each other friends and families and have great time hanging out with them. 
Everyone knows that we are dating but we never call each other lover or bf/gf in front of them. 

He used to be married once and it ended unhappily after a huge history they had and he made a lot of efforts for the relationship and marriage then. 
He said he is not ready for any new relationship right now. 

He is very popular with women and he likes talking to them and having many female friends around. 
Sometimes I have feelings that he doesn’t want to commit yet because he is still looking for a better one or he wants to enjoy his freedom after many years in marriage. 

I like him a lot and he’s never done anything to make me worry about his feelings for me. We talk about near future plans too but not further things like relationship or marriage. 

Things between us have been still good but I am wondering if this situation is normal for divorced men as I have no experience with them. What I have been telling myself is that I should keep trying and waiting for him to commit but I am turning 30 very soon and I want to settle down this year so I have my own concern about commitment and relationship."
"6 year relationship with covid complications   My girlfriend (23) and I (23) have been dating for over 6 years. We’ve had an extremely strong relationship. We both live home, I’ve been working full time since graduating college 2 years ago. She is just graduating, May 2020. We’ve wanted to move in together for a while but the finances don’t make sense considering I would not be able to support the two of us on my salary. 
   Since we both live home we have not been able to see each other for 8 weeks due to Covid-19 (located in NYC). Her family is not taking it as serious as mine. My family is big on social distancing and not sharing households for the time being. It is putting a tremendous amount of stress on our relationship. I’ve been trying to get though to her but she doesn’t seem to understand that I need to respect how  everyone in my household feels. 
  Am I in the wrong for not seeing her? Is she being selfish? She’s threatened to leave me because she couldn’t handle being apart and is constantly throwing my family’s feelings about covid in my face. She’s asking I put her and her needs first. How should I take this?"
"Can emotionally abusive people change? Is it worth the risk? [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/g9xbtd/boyfriend\_doesnt\_like\_how\_i\_dress\_what\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g9xbtd/boyfriend_doesnt_like_how_i_dress_what_should_i/)

So about a week ago I (30f) ended my two year relationship with (35m) boyfriend. At the time I knew it was totally the right thing to do and although sad, I felt good about it. 

For context there is the link above. In a nutshell, he was controlling about my time and space, sexually coercive, generally made me feel emotionally exhausted and then complained about how much I slept. 

The problem is that we have been in contact due to sorting money etc out. And he is being so understanding, sweet and has apologized for his behaviour (with a little dose of mansplaining). It's like I've got the person he was at the beginning back, but I feel like the damage is already done and if I go back it will just end up the same. I know I need to cut contact but I've not been able to do it yet, I'm doubting myself about whether I've exaggerated his behaviour.
 
Tl;dr - Doubting myself that I made the right choice to leave and is it worth trying again."
"Why do I [31F] continue to attract or fall for men who abuse alcohol? I always seem to fall for men who abuse alcohol, and I don’t know why. Wall of text to follow.

Background on me: I drink maybe once or twice a month. I like going to wineries and breweries and things like that. I would classify my personal relationship with alcohol as fairly normal. I also have a great relationship with my dad and my brothers if that matters. 

My relationships: When I was 25, I dated a man [26 at time] for two years. He abused alcohol, would deny drink, would hide bottles around, etc. I didn’t know what an issue it was until I made the mistake of moving in with him at the one year mark. I was crippled with anxiety all the time, and was embarrassed to have him around family and friends. I had been planning on leaving for a while but had to get my finances and other deals in order. I finally left when he threatened self-harm and I thought maybe I would be next. 

We broke up when I was 27. I was single for the next two years, going on dates here and there but mostly not dating. I was focusing on my career and working past what had happened in my previous relationship.

When I was 29, I met someone [34M]. We had a great first date. I thought he was nice, we could talk and our personalities clicked. A few dates later, we somehow got into a conversation about dealbreakers and I said that alcohol abuse is one for me because I went through a lot in the past. He agreed and told a story about how painful it was to watch a friend struggle with addiction and how it impacted relationships. He seemed like a great and understanding guy. 

Maybe three months into our relationship, I started noticing weird things when we would text on the days we didn’t see each other. He couldn’t hold a conversation at all. Kinda incoherent. I asked if he was drinking, he said no. Turns out he was and he was binge drinking for days at a time. I finally figured it out for sure after a long weekend I spent with him. I stayed at his house, we drank a few beers each and went to bed. The next morning, he was up at 7 and had already opened a beer and proceeded to binge drink. I tried to hide a few beers when he went to the bathroom (mistake) after he’d been drinking for hours and he came out and yelled at me to “never do that again and to get the fuck out of my house.” 

I left and texted him it was over. A few days later he called to apologize and said he was going through some stuff and he shouldn’t have done what he did. He promised he would be better. I gave him another chance because I was afraid I was trying to see my ex in him. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Things were better for a while until they weren’t. We only dated a few more months after that before I finally said I had enough and ended it. He binge drank through our break up and texted me vile and hurtful things. I’m glad I ended it.

So today. I am almost 31, and I’m almost afraid to date (no where near ready to do that again) because I don’t know why I attract and fall for guys who seem to have issues with alcohol. I have an insane amount of anxiety about it. I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with me."
"I’m going over to a girl’s house tonight and I have absolutely no experience So basically me and this girl have been snapping for a few weeks and we learned that we’re neighbours. So yesterday, she told me her parents and siblings are going out of town for a night and she’ll be home alone. She wants me to come over but I’ve had next to no experience with women and I have no idea what to do. I need any advice"
Any advice? My girlfriend who I've been dating for a couple months just asked me is if I'd still love her if she was a man. I don't really know how to respond to this because this is my first relationship. Does anyone have advice about this?
"My girlfriend cheated on me and I don’t know what to do 
It happened yesterday when my girlfriend who has super strict parents was trying to get another phone so she could talk to me without being monitored. She had asked “everyone” she knew and it came down to one boy who I was already worried about because they had a history. He was supposed to come to her house and drop the phone off and next thing I knew my girlfriend told me they were just hanging in the basement “not doing anything.” After he left we were on facetime and I asked her if anything happened and she swore nothing did but it was real suspicious. After facetime I was just gaming when she called me and said she did stuff with him and started crying because I said I was going to leave her. Her story is “she knew he wanted something and she is a people pleaser” so she gave him head. Right now I have her blocked because I seriously don’t know what to do. We have been dating for about 5 months and I don’t know if I feel bad or what I don’t know if I should give her a second chance. Please give me advice.

Edit: The head wasn’t for a favor she just did it to do it."
"Am I over exaggerating the situation? I (F24) my boyfriend (M30) I (F24) my boyfriend (M30) have been together for 7 months. Back in December I found out he lied about giving his phone number to a girl at a party. 

Long story short, my boyfriend and my female friend happened to be at the same party. 
He didn’t know that she and I are good friends. 
They happened to be at the same table and overheard that she’s looking for a bank job. 
He gave her his business card and offered to use his name as a reference. 

As all that was happening, my friend was updating me about the situation. 
I asked her to text him after the party to see if he would respond. He did, although it was at 2:30 AM. 

That same night he gave me a call and told me how the party went. 
He mentioned that a girl sitting in his table was talking about some bank job. But he lied about giving his business card along with his phone number. 
He said he didn’t even talk to her. 

The next day I confronted him about the lie. 
He was furious and tried to defend himself by saying that “I didn’t seem like I was interested in talking to him that night”. He always didn’t think it was a big deal and he didn’t think of it as a lie. 

I tried to let it go and move on. 
Fast forward 5 months later, the situation still bothers me. I feel like I can’t trust anything he says anymore. I keep thinking about how much more he has lied about. I opened up about how I’m feeling and he was understanding towards it. 

He also lied about quitting smoking when in reality he didn’t. 
Smoking doesn’t bother me, but lying about it does. 

I have a feeling that he’s a habitual liar, even though he denies it and reassures me that the only lie he told was about the party. 

TL;DR Aside from that, he’s a great guy, considerate of my feelings, loves me and wants to spend the rest of our lives together. He’s my soulmate. 

Am I making a big deal about this? 
I want to give him a second chance but I’m afraid of making that mistake."
"Should I break up with my bf? Me (17F) and my bf(18) have been dating for ten months. We broke up in November because his family told him I was ‘too shy’ and his mom tried to break us up again right before quarantine happened. 

I really love him and love spending time with him but I know he’s definitely not the one. His family is very loud and I would never fit in and he can get really angry. 

Even though we’re not perfect, we’re young and just having fun. We say it’s not serious just to make our parents happy and reassure ourselves that it isn’t but we pretty much act like a serious couple. 

The problem is that I always reach out. Every since quarantine started he just stopped talking to me. I’ve told him about four times how this makes me feel like he doesn’t love me and unimportant and he says he’s sorry and he’s gonna change. He texts me the next day but then after that he forgets. 
 
I haven’t heard his voice or seen his face in more than a week. He never calls me anymore, all he does is send me memes. I normally love this but we haven’t had a real conversation in
If he can forget that he has a girlfriend so easily then is our relationship even worth it?

I’ve also been having a very hard time lately with depression and loneliness, which he knows. And he still hasn’t reached out in over a week. It’s been two months since we’ve hung out in person and he’s not putting any effort in. 

But if it’s not serious, should I care this much? I know we’re young and just trying to have fun and be casual but this doesn’t even seem like that. I have a few friends/acquaintances that I talk to basically everyday. Am I overreacting?"

My girlfriend recently joined a lesbian discord that she found through Twitter. I was originally apart of this group too, but after she posted our relationship issues in one of the channels, I decided to leave to attempt to save face.


So, recently, she sends me some nudes, you know, kind of normal. They're pretty typical of the nudes you send in a relationship. The pose is sexual in nature, facial expression too. I reply with a compliment, then she sends a message back that says something along the lines of, ""[The chat] said nudes were cool."" I'm like, what? I ask her not to send nudes. She tells me she already has.


Now, I'm not the kind of person to be controlling/jealous, I hate it; however, this really stung me for some reason. This is not something that has come up in our relationship before (1.5 years), and she hardly knows these people. She's also done a few other things with these people recently that sort of rubbed me the wrong way. We already discussed this, as I mentioned that what she did with them made me feel less special, and then she sent nudes not even a week later.


I'm sort of at a loss as to what to do. My 2 close friends think I should break up with her. Am I in the right to be upset? And where should I go from here?


Tl;dr: My girlfriend sent nudes to a group chat and I don't know if I should break up with her or not."
My girlfriend just told that she can live without me Hey im Nathaniel I am in a relationship with my girlfriend Jessica we had a fight the other day and she said she was done with me. Now I am starting to think that she doesn't love me like she use too because everytime I ask her can she live without me she says yes I can and we have a  daughter together I just want too know what should do because I love her but I don't think she's feeling the same way
"ThrowRa: Quarantine is ruining my relationship My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) had only been dating for a few monthss before the quarantine started but things were going great and we were super close (we had been friends for years before we even started dating).

We planned on moving in togther but the virus stuff started to get serious and the quarantine started, so that obviously did not happen.

Without getting into too much detail I've basically been watching all of my dreams and life plans fall apart due to covid, I'm now unemployed and unable to leave the house due to a parent with severe OCD, and I slowly had nothing to talk to him about other than how depressed/anxious I was. I mean how many days in a row can I ask him how work was, and then when he asks me how my day was I say ""not good, I sat in my room watching youtube and crying"" and he tells me ""it will be ok"".

I don't expect him to ""help"" me, I can only help myself but I just feel like I have nothing to offer to a conversation other then ""I'm sad"". It gets old and who wants to talk to someone who's a complete bummer? So we went from texting/calling every day, to texting once or twice a day, and now we haven't talked at all in a week. Last thing he said was ""If you don't want to talk it's ok and I hope things get better"" and I thanked him for understanding.

Where do I even go from here? I have so many mixed emotions. Am I selfish to try and make this relationship work when I'm at such a low point in my life? I feel like I have nothing to offer him. I love this guy so much but I haven't been able to get myself out of bed let alone try and act normal and hold a conversation like nothing bad is happening.

Is anyone experiencing something similar? Or does anyone have any advice? I try to always be as upbeat as possible but for the last 2 months I've been an emotional mess and at such a loss for what to do.

Edit: Wording"
"EX POSTING MY PHONE NUMBER AND IM RECEIVING THREATENING TEXTS? My ex gf who has border line personality disorder has posted my phone number saying I’m abusive, it’s 2am and I’m getting so many texts from people it’s horrible.. what can I do?"
"What to do ? Bf (30) What do you do when someone twists your words ? Im a person who hates saying the same thing 100 times ... but i feel like my bf twists my words. 

I love having debates and long conversations about anything .. its just my personality .. whenever me and my bf have these conversations he shuts down and just take it to a personal level ... im tired of feeling like im walking on egg shells while just talking about regular stuff."
"In need of Outside Perspective I am in desperate need of an outsider's opinion on my situation, there's a lot to unpack here so please bear with me. 

So my GF(32) and I(M25) have been together for 3 years and we've been through so much together. One of the things we've been through is a little over a year into our relationship we talked about being open for distance reasons as we lived two hours apart. We tried talking to other people and I couldn't really deal all that well with it. So we decided just to be monogamous after all. 

Fast forward maybe another year and she gets all worked up about being bisexual saying that I don't support her or like her being bisexual. This confused me as I have no issue with it and actually enjoy checking out women with her. But what she wanted was the ability to act on that bisexuality. (Now my opinion on this did change over the years, when we first started dating I was of the opinion just tell me about it, it doesn't count cause it's with a girl. However after trying to be open I realized that sex with another person is sex with another person and viewing it any other way seems a bit sexist to me now.) But she became upset that I no longer supported her being bi because my attitude on her acting on it had changed(I said she could still act on it as long as I got to sleep with other women too). But we had a fight about that, eventually had to take that one to therapy where we supposedly talked it out.

Now for my current situation, where we have been living together for five months and she has been getting more and more irritable and withdrawn. Two weeks ago I found out she had been texting an old flame, who lives in Oklahoma, we are in MN. She was planning on driving to see him. When I found out everything blew up. She told me how she has had to turn parts of herself off/keep them bottled up being monogamous with me and now it's finally come to the breaking point. This past week she went to stay at her parents to do some thinking. We talked on the phone and she told me that I was still her person and she still wanted to have kids with me and that meant something. So now she's in Oklahoma with this dude. And in order for us to move forward I need to be okay with being open. Which I think I could do, but I also would never drive 11hrs just for a fuck. I just don't know. She could very well be telling me the truth when she says I'm her person. She could also just be trying to keep me on the hook because I take care of everything for her. Or she could subconsciously be done with me and not even realize it. I don't know which one it is and I'm lost."
New Can someone please text me I’m really bored :/
"Trying to deal with my SO’s friendship with his ex I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a year now. A little ways into our relationship, I learned about a friend he had that he talks to pretty regularly through his phone. I found out it was an ex of his from 10 years ago. When I initially found that out, I told him then that I wished that he was a bit more transparent about that, but I tried not to give it too much weight because I know it’s normal to have exes as friends. He didn’t think it was necessary to explain all of that because their 2 year relationship was so long ago, he didn’t think it mattered. 
But as time went on after I found out that detail, there was something that still bothered me about it. Like the fact that they only talked while he was at work. And the fact that it was someone whom I’d probably never meet. I noticed they were specifically talking though twitter, which also struck me as odd. And as mentioned earlier, it’s pretty regularly.

I decided to ask him more about it because of these reasons. 
He told me they were just friends, that they’ve had a close friendship for years after their relationship. 
I guess she had left him for the guy she’s married to now. (My boyfriend forgave her obviously since they’re friends still). Her husband doesn’t like my boyfriend, and that’s why communication is hidden through things like Twitter, so as not to start fights between her and her husband. 

I get that it’s a friend... but there’s just something that feels so wrong to me about the situation. It feels secretive, and ultimately I feel emotionally slighted. 
I’m not going to ask him to choose between a friend and myself. I would never do that, but I can’t change the fact that I feel uncomfortable that he has someone that he’s texting almost every day while he’s at work, who happens to be an ex. He described it to me as “pen pals,” and I guess that makes sense. But there’s still something off to me about it, and I can’t get over it. I feel like he’s emotionally cheating on me almost. I just feel so in the dark about it. At this point, I’m sure their conversations are mundane....and that makes it feel even worse for some reason. I don’t have friends I talk to like that. I talk to HIM like that. 

He and I keep talking about this, and it’s turning into a fight. He said he gets how I feel and would feel the same way if he were me, but he’s upset at me for accusing him of cheating on me, which I do understand.  I’m not trying to accuse him of anything, it’s just how the situation feels. He says I just need to trust him, and that if the situation ever became inappropriate, then he would handle it.

I feel like the problem lies with me, but I don’t know how to accept it. Every day at work now, I’m just going to be thinking about the fact that he’s talking to some mystery woman, and it makes me feel like shit. But he’s perfectly in the right to have friends, regardless of their history. I don’t want this to be a wedge in our relationship, and it’s becoming one if I can’t come to terms with this. 
I know he loves me and doesn’t want to hurt me, and he hates to see me this upset. He doesn’t know what to do about it, and frankly I don’t either. He’s not changing his behavior. She’s been apart of his life much longer than I have, even if it’s through a phone, so they’re still going to text, and I just need to accept it. 

I don’t even know what I’m accomplishing by sharing this. I’m just hoping to get some outside perspective I guess."
"(Bi) friend sent me uncomfortable message To start, my friend has been in a long term relationship with a very attractive girl for many years, around 6.

He has come to stay with me during Coronavirus isolation, upon my offer, to help deal with his heartbreak.

The other night we were drinking and he’s stood talking to my girlfriend. He keeps looking at me and shaking his head, and goes on to send me a message via Facebook. 

The messages begin with him telling me how horny my girlfriend is making him. I message back that I understand but it’s not something to act on. He continues to push on the matter and I rebut likewise. 

I go to take a shower, during which time he messages me something much more extreme than the previous messages. This time with a homosexual element. 

I’m ok with this at the time, perhaps due to the social lubricant that is vodka and rum but nonetheless I don’t make him feel bad. 

Since being sober and having time to reflect on what happened I’ve become quite uncomfortable. He’s staying with me and my girlfriend and has expressed quite explicitly a bisexual attraction to us both that is not reciprocated.

I’d like to know what you think my next move should be. Thanks"
"I (26M) am very confused about my (28F) girlfriend. Hey there,

I would kindly need some advice regarding what is going on with the relationship. Some 3 months ago my coworker started the job where I work and apparently had a huge crush on me from the beginnig. We started talking on whatssup,but I wasn't involved from the beginnig with a reason(I didn't knew her intensions and what she actually wanted,maybe only sex)and she pointed out this at some point(that I was ignoring her). After some talking and her sending me lots of pictures,during the pandemic I felt the need to see her and I invited her to my place to talk. We kissed,then after some 3 weeks I invited her again,the same story. But,since some 2 weeks I feel she isn't the same girl,not too much talking and seems like she is avoiding to see me.It's not the kind of relationship I was used too,and she had two relationships were she was cheated on. I really care about her and let her know that I am there for her but I don't want to waste time with someone who maybe is just playing with the others emotions.

Sorry for the long post."
"My bf doesn’t seem to care about me My bf (20M) and I (19F) have been dating for over 2 years and he doesn’t seem to think about our future realistically. He talks about us getting married and having a family, but he basically refuses to save any money even though he knows I don’t want to wait forever to start our lives together. I on the other hand do save money, but I don’t make a lot where I work now. He also cheated on me about a year and a half into our relationship. He was going through some tough family stuff and got super drunk, so I’m trying to forgive him but he hasn’t given me time to. The girl he cheated with was the one who told me, and when I confronted him about it he didn’t tell me the whole truth so I had to ask the girl about it. He also lied to me for a month about how he stopped drinking when he was drinking 5-6 nights out of the week. He then lied again after that about not drinking. He also does stupid and dangerous stuff when he drinks and says it doesn’t directly effect me so why should I care. He never makes an effort to bring me around his friends and he doesn’t want to be around mine. He doesn’t ever ask me to do anything with his family either. He doesn’t take me out on dates, and if we do go out I always have to buy everything myself. I’m not trying to play helpless either. I buy him food almost every time I go over to his house without asking anything in return, but it would be nice to feel thought about like that. And I’m ALWAYS the one driving to see him. He never drives to my house. He never posts about me and frequently like pictures of half naked girls on social media that he knows irl and claims it’s nbd bc they’re friends and continued to do this after I told him I didn’t like it. I don’t have a problem with him watching porn but he also follows a bunch of porn stars and I don’t like the idea of him just seeing naked women all throughout the day. I had to start going back to counseling because my anxiety has gotten so bad. I’m obsessing over every little things worrying about him lying to me or cheating on me again. I’ve tried multiple times to break up with him but he always promises he’ll do better and I always end up believing him. I love him and I feel like I’ve tried so hard to make it work, but I don’t get the same feeling from him and I don’t know what to do or how to approach it to make him understand."
"My guy best friend and I established we liked each other and now it’s really strange. Help. I’ve been friends with this guy for over a year. We are best friends and see each other often. A few months ago he kissed me at his house when we were drunk. He confessed feelings for me and we had a good night and I also told him I liked him. I never thought it would happen like that or that i would fall for him, but he’s a great person so I obviously caught feelings in that moment. The next day comes and we don’t mention it, we text a little and that’s it. We don’t talk for a few days and then he comes over again and we cuddle and hold hands but we still don’t mention it. A couple weeks goes by and I’m dying so I mention it to him and we talk about it and he tells me he likes me a lot but he can’t have a relationship right now for a lot of personal reasons, like his family is very strict religiously and won’t allow him to date anyways. But he still says he wants to talk to me and he likes me. We continue to hang out he hold my hand all the time, kisses my forehead, compliments me etc..... we’ll quarantine happens we don’t see each other for a month then he invites me to go camping with a couple of our other friends. I get there we reunite and we drink. One things leads to another we confess feelings again and we talk about a lot. He tells me he really likes me, we kiss, and end up sleeping in a hammock together (we didn’t do anything sexual) it’s hard to remember a lot because I was drunk but my friend tells me we were looking at each other all cute and just acting like a couple. He also told me he loved me twice that night (while drunk) randomly, it sure is weird to say I love you to someone you’ve passed the friend zone with but I know he’s probably not in love with me lol. It’s weird I know he is not ready for a relationship so I’m not sure how to deal with this. The next day he gets a text from his boss saying he has to leave and come to a meeting and so we go the whole day knowing he is leaving at the end and I could just tell something was wrong, he barely talked to me all day and just seemed sad. I hugged him like twice both times my doing. It just felt depressing and he was just very nervous and awkward. When he left that night I hugged him and said bye and told him to be safe and that I loved him, he said he loved me too and he left. The next morning I messaged him saying I missed him and he said he missed me too and hoped he could see me soon and I told him that if he needed to talk about anything EHHHEEMMM or needed anything to just tell me. I said I didn’t want him to be sad, I knew he was. And he just left me on read this morning. I am just so weirded out and confused by this man. What should I do? What should I say to him? How should I approach this moving forward?"
"I [M22] took my girlfriend [F21] on a road trip which stopped by my ex’s place, and I don’t know if that’s shitty or not... I planned a road trip with my girlfriend down the coast of California (pacific coast highway). It’s a bucket list thing I’ve always wanted to do and so I planned it for last summer. My ex and I were in Monterey, which was a stop on our road trip. This was more than 4 years ago (ex and I were together for 6 months, current girlfriend and I together for 2 years at the time). 

My ex and I were long distance and only had been together for 1 whole day together in Monterey. 

We did the road trip, drove by the city where I used to be with my ex, stayed at the hotel there (because I knew the town), walked around town, and drove off to continue our road trip. 

Now, a year later, I feel kinda shitty that happened. My girlfriend knows my ex and I were in California but doesn’t know that that’s where we went. I didn’t take my girlfriend to where I went with my ex, however it was the same town because I knew the town quite well.  

Was that shitty? What should I do? Should I even do anything?"
"How should I (M24) act around my ex-girlfriend (F21) at work? Casually dated a girl for a year (met at work). She fell in love with me but due to a number of issues with myself and my life at that time, I made a lot of mistakes, was depressed, and hurt her emotionally. She held on for a while but then left me and cut me out of her life, and was totally justified in doing so because I was a mess back then and needed to work on myself before I worried about anything else.

I've finally done that; I threw away that old hurtful, pathetic me. We only met up in person one time, which was long after the breakup, and about 6 months ago now. I have texted her occasionally and she has responded only a bit, but nothing good happened there. Now we work together again. It's only food delivery, but we're still going to come across each other occasionally when our shifts align. Today was the first day we saw each other but there was no interaction because it was so hectic.

Let me be clear: yes, of course my intention is to prove to her I've changed and I would love for another opportunity to actually love her right. So only advice that helps me pursue that idea, please.

I know getting women to open up to you is a challenging puzzle, so I'm a bit unsure as to how I should act around her now. When we first met, it was easy because there was mystery there, the flirting flowed naturally, and we fell into love over the months. But now things are different. She views me as the guy who hurt her and who was an asshole, even though she respected and loved me. And that's right of course...about the past. I've worked hard to change that.

I don't think I should just treat her the same as every other stranger or coworker because I think that'd send the signal that I'm no longer interested and don't care about my past mistakes. And I don't want to completely ignore her because that will look like I never changed and am still an asshole. But I'm nervous about trying to subtly flirt or anything because I'm afraid of messing up and coming across as weird or out of line.

But I guess I really do need to stop avoiding risk, take the chance, and subtly flirt and try to show her the new me, right? Because telling her through text that I've changed didn't do anything. She literally told me to ""prove it."""
"Am I wasting my time? So it's going to be long. Since I have to give the full story. I met my bf (48) when I (37) was 16. He was my first boyfriend. I had never been intimate with anyone, so he never pressure me. But, he had many women who he was intimate with. Due to my age an inexperienced although it bothered me,  I just dealt with it. He eventually moved away,broke up with me and broke my heart. I at that time was 18. 
   I started dating someone else. I had a baby. Unfortunately my relationship with my babies father didnt work out. At 20 my ex came back into my life. I again gave us a chance but that didnt work. After we were intimate he said he only wanted to have sex with me for revenge. He somehow felt I should have waited when he moved away. But, in my defense I disnt know when and if he would move back, what I didn't know was he had other women. He somehow saw it differently. 
   After we broke up. We somehow got back together broke up periodically for the next 3 year. At 23 we finally decided on moving in together. Our relationship finally seemed to be going soewhere. Or so I thought.  To my surprise I go over and a woman opened the door. That was the last time I saw him. I disappeared from his life. He never bothered to look for me. 
   I got married had more children. Throughout my marriage I always thought of him my husband and children knew of him. Over a year ago my marriage ended. Although we remain friends and care about each other. The love was no longer there. He left me everything and we coparent great. Divorce was the best choice and save our ability to remain friends for the children.  
    One night on social media my exes profile popped up on my profile. It took weeks but I finally decided to contact him. Everything was great. I felt love again. Even though we just talked. We decided to meet in person.  To say the least I saw him and all the feelings came back. It was him , the love of my life.  But due to our history. I told him exactly what I expected.  We set timelines. He met my children everything was great. He seems to be matured finally ready to settle down. He made comments like "" now I know what I want, I should have never let you go. He said and was everything I wanted back when I was 16.
   We decide to become intimate everything was great.  Until I find out the next day he was on social media liking pictures of other women. One being the woman who had been at his apartment years ago. He had stayed in touch with her all these years. But not only her. Also other women. And on top of that he now had these womens kids as friends and would comment on their profiles. I was done, and ready to walk away. Yet he deleted everyone. He said he didnt agree with deleting them they were just friends, he had never done that for any woman but would do it for me. So I stayed. 
   We moved in together. But due to our past I'm obviously very insecure. To top it off he makes comments about my weight, he says things like I'm a 5 or 6 out of 10. Hes said things like "" when we break up I'm sleeping with someone else a week later. Or says he should find someone else. He tried to but me a matching shirt, later to find out it had been a couples shirt with another ex. He tried to to the same thing he did with an ex on valentines the year prior. An trips, and restaurants are memory lane for him.He constantly makes me feel insecure with his comments.  And also the way he acts. I'm so in love with him and obviously want to be next to him and cuddle. He will push me away. I've told him that hurts my feelings. He says I should just be quiet,  not complain,deal with it. And let him give me affection when he feels like it. He says hes the man he should do the chasing. 
   I love him, I've never love anyone like him. And it hurts when he pushes me away, or the comments he makes.  I do everything for this man. Yet he will be out with me sees a woman with any beauty and will continue to stare at her in front of me. Although I've told him it bothers me and hurts my feelings specially when he call me names due to my weight. 
 He says I should know hes joking. 
   Part of me wants to continue trying but the other part wants to give up. I know what I can offer. And I know most men would consider me a 7or 8. I own my home, have a successful career, I cater to him when I get home,  I'm working on my weight, but honestly i know i dnt look bad. He wont let me go out with friends I know is because he knows I might meet someone else. So I'm not a 5 or overweight like he will try to put in my head. I feel so unattractive, unappreciated by him. I know I deserve a man that will make me feel like the most beautiful woman ever. I deserve someone who doesnt seem to hide things or be shady.  I know I deserve someone who will know I'm worth it and will do anything to keep me. Yet , I stay with him hoping he will change. And when I'm ready to call it quits he gives me just enough to give me hope and I stay. I feel too old for this. I feel I'm wasting my time. But what if he really does love me and I just need to be patient. What if hes right. I havent been in all these relationships he has. What if I'm the problem. Are my insecurities the problem and I should not bring them into our relationship.  Am I really the issue."
I have had a rocky relationship. I just had I hard time with women my whole life how can I have a better view of women?
"Does he have feelings for me? [M22] [F19] So this guy [M22].  [F19] I've been talking to him since November, and right away there was this click. We were talking alot, like paragraphs back and forth almost every day.  We eventually started this thing where we started saying good morning to eachother and good night every night.  We talked 3 monthes straight this way. Then at the end of January I got busy and wasn't able to text him. We stopped talking completely. A month ago he texted me and we talked a little bit one day and then it stopped.   Today, for some reason I all of a sudden started thinking about him, about our conversations, and realized how much I missed talking to him.  So I sent him a text.  And we instantly connected again, he admitted that he was glad to hear from me, and that the good morning things meant alot to him too. Then he asked if we could call this weekend or something. I told him about my voice, I was self conscious.  And he remembered it :)) he remembered a video of my voice from 3 monthes prior. And that he remembered the good mornings. I'm just kinda stunned and happy, but I'm not sure what to think?  Even my bff doesn't remember things I tell her, or hardly even remember me and that's just within one week😅"
"Boyfriend (34) doesn't like when males text me (28) at night Subject pretty much says it all, my boyfriend is bothered by males text. I have a coworker, who I find pretty cool, and we normally chat it up and joke around. I by no means, have a crush on him or anything like that. I see my coworker's relationship as strictly platonic/friend/professional. I'm going to respect my boyfriend's request and not text back late - as he was bothered that this coworker texted me late, and then it veered off into a conversation about tattoos. My boyfriend felt it was inappropriate that he was texting me so late (11:30pm) and that he thinks my coworker probably has other intentions because ""that's what guys do when they like a girl"" IDK what do you think? Do you think he is overreacting or is he right and it's totally not cool to text someone of the opposite gender late at night?"
Ok all. Need a little more help from you again. Ok so I’ve been meeting with this girl that has kids every now and then ever since this whole virus things started. Now I understand a lot of you will tell me to stay home however I’m wondering if even though I’ve only caught up with her a handful of times and we’re not officially together would it be weird if I took her flowers or something for Mother’s Day.
"How do I respond to my husband who told me I cant 'control myself' because I had a panic attack? We have been married for 4 years, I am 26f and he is 27m, we live in Canada. 
My husband and I have been going through some stressful times recently, financially, and we've been unsure of whether or not we are going to lose our home. We had unexpected news do with his boss's business and it has thrown everything (it feels like) in our lives into a very uncertain place with job, home, ect. Everything came to a head a few weeks ago and one day after a very sanitized grocery run when I came home I had a panic attack. Two hours of crying, shaking, chills, I do not remember a lot of what happened but my husband did stay with me and ran me a bath until I was able to breath again. 
I had another attack about 10 days ago that was handled much better and did not get to that extreme point thank goodness. I've talked to my family doctor since and he said that while it is not ideal or fun, in a way it is a 'natural' response to what we are going through since our whole life and home feel threatened. 
Skip ahead to yesterday, we were having a completely unrelated discussion about emotions and how they were handled in our family growing up. My husband is a very independent and detached person, he likes to escape reality in his down time, but often if things happen he has no idea how he feels about a situation and doesn't think it is important to do any kind of self reflection or processing (his words actually, not mine. He just does not want to do it ever and I think he was being honest). Obviously that makes it difficult to talk about hard things since he just wants to avoid emotional or hard topics altogether. At the most he will let me talk about something and then move along from the topic. 
I said something during our conversation about how it might be good for him to understand his emotions a bit better, and he turned to me and said, ""that's rich, coming from you. You have no control over yourself, you had a panic attack.""
I was very hurt by that comment but so taken aback that the conversation ended and we haven't had any deep conversation since.
I don't know what to do now?
I feel like I am a huge inconvenience to him now for having had a panic attack...
How do you talk with someone who doesn't even think it's important/wants to?"
"I don’t know what to do about my abusive fiancé So just following up on yesterday’s post. I’ll gloss over a bit of it, I keep getting shut down for being unfamiliar with Reddit’s rules. You can check out my original post if you’re interested. 

My (34M) fiancé (30F) and I have been fighting about her drinking for over 2 years. She’s a nasty drunk, I won’t go into details. But she’s been promising me that’ll she’ll change for years and it just isn’t happening. We had a massive fight over Easter and since then she’s been sober, but this week she unilaterally decided she’ll be drinking this weekend. 

I told her I was not happy with this and that she had told me she was gonna stop. Asked why she thought I had to put up with her abuse just so she can get a little buzz. She kind of just glossed it over. 

When she got home she got mad at me because I was upset at her. Starting yelling at me that I was abusive and controlling. I yelled back and told her I wasn’t going to be abused by her anymore and that I’d rather be single than go through all that again. That I’m not gonna let her abuse our kids (we’re trying to get pregnant). She got really mad and yelled and turned it all back on me somehow. And it’s been on and off arguing since then. 

She gets in these moods and acts like I’m the biggest prick on the planet but then in a few days she’ll be all apologetic and promising change. Which I think is part of why I don’t leave, I know she’s just a bit out of her mind atm. But I also know that doesn’t excuse bad behaviour. 

So the advice. Is there any way to salvage this? We tried counselling, she felt like the counseler and I were ganging up on her and is unwilling to try again. She’s mostly ok when she doesn’t drink but claims ‘I won’t live my life with you if I can’t drink’ 

It seems pretty clear cut but for some reason I can’t leave her. I feel responsible for her, and I know she’ll basically drink herself to death if I leave. 

Also because of my rough childhood I’m desensitised to physical violence and I subconsciously believe that love and abuse go hand in hand. So in a twisted way I’m perfect for her? Like I’m taking one for the team by putting up with it? Like it’s a test of my mental and physical strength and to breakup with her would be to admit that I’m weak. It’s messed up. 

I don’t know, I need help. And I can’t ask my friends because frankly I’m embarrassed by my situation. What do I do? 

TLDR I don’t know what to do about my abusive fiancé"
"Neighbor loves fire, how do I respect her love while asking her to stop?? I live in a U shaped multiplex. Most of my neighbors are friends now due to them all being home and hanging out in the courtyard together. 

Now, my boyfriend and I don’t mind that they’re always outside and hanging out/chatting/playing the radio (okay we do mind but didn’t think it was a big enough issue to say anything). But now it’s getting warmer and our complex has no AC  so we need to leave a door or window open to get some air in and out. 

I want to ask them to chill on the (albeit small) bon fires that they make because the smoke gets in our unit and we don’t like it. 

How do I ask them to stop without being overbearing? I have a feeling that everyone else in the complex doesn’t like us because we have no interest in hanging out with them (they’ve never asked but if we did we’d probably decline anyway)

Thanks for your thoughts!"
Lost my best friend of 3 years to coke and some girls she met a few weeks ago I’ve always been there for her but after I have a breakup this happens 💔 these ppl trash her house and take advantage of her I’ve always done so much for her without wanting praise but now I really feel used and alone sorry to be dark I just had to express it she acts like I’m overacting but I’ve just done so much and don’t even get invited to a going away party cause grown adults she just met wanna do coke with her
My (21m) girlfriend (48f) wants me to eat out her friend (49f) and as a reward they would give me a double bj. Is this some kind of freaking trap? My girlfriend who I’ll call Ronda says her bisexual friend who I’ll call “Danielle” has never had a guy come close to eating her out as good as a girl does. Ronda has slept with Danielle many times and they used to date but this was back in the 90’s in college. They got married to guys and decided to be friends. Both have been divorced for years. They say they are like sisters.  Ronda said I’m very good at eating her out like almost as good as a woman and she wants Danielle to get eaten out by me so they can compare to other times Danielle has been eaten out. Ronda says she wouldn’t get jealous and that as long as I don’t kiss her or f*ck her there are no problems. She said they would even preform a double bj on me. Now this is really hot. But it’s also really risky because I don’t want to have anything go wrong with my relationship with Ronda or make her jealous I don’t feel like this would end well even if the sex is great. What should I do?
"Should I get back with my girlfriend ? I meet her when we were in a mall with some friends , she was one of the people invited , we talked a lot and we had a lot in common , and some of course differences , afterwards we started talking through WhatsApp and started dating , on the date she had colored contact lenses and I thought her eyes were green but we're brown instead , also I thought she had a whiter skin but was instead darker , she had really white make up , she looked beautiful with that , without that not that much , I was disappointed by that but she was still attractive to me so I stayed with her.

Afterwards erything was really good , and I was very happy ,she wasn't able to pay for anything because her parents didn't have her money so I paid for literally everything we did together and the taxi and those kinds of things , I was spending almost half of my salary on her and we weren't doing anything expensive , the transportation was really the number one spending, we were going out to many places and having so much fun , we had our first kiss , and the first for her in all her life (Im her first boyfriend, I had just a girlfriend before) , after some really happy months , we had sex , it was her first time , the second for me , we of course used protection and kept track of her cicle , I was really nervous of getting her pregnant so I suffered some of the times because I though she would get pregnant , but I was really careful with that , I suggested another and more effective anticonceptive method but she didn't accepted it's use , after that I refused to have intercourse because of the pressure it implied for me , if she got pregnant I wouldnt be able to manitain her , and our life would get really bad , so I took that choice until she accepted to use the other anticonceptive.

I bought her somehow expensive gifts in her birthday and in our monthly anniversary , but she would get angry at me because sometimes I forgot things , and sometimes wasn't able to answer her in WhatsApp , at that time I was working my ass off to have more to give her , because I felt I was kinda insufficient in the economical aspect , but I still tried to get her to cool or somehow expensive places and malls for her to be happy, she knew about my economical situation as well at the time.

We started having a lot of problems really constantly mainly because she would get angry for anything like me forgetting valentines day , even tho we were already spoken about the work I had that it was a lot , and  that I hadn't slept almost two days , and she complained and got sad because I forgot , I really felt sorry but I was really bad in the aspect of sleep deprivation , I was trying to work more hours to get more money , anyway , I after getting out to work at 11 pm at night bought her a gift before getting almost killed by a car , and proceed to go to her house , I got there and she felt better , but those kind of things in many different levels and even for chat started to happen and I had to apologise many times because of that , but she wouldnt comprehend even thou be talked about that.

So we started to have many problems like that , and I tried to solve them all in a good way , and talking about it , she sometimes accepted the facts but kept complaint and making me feel guilty afterwards , one day I got exahusted about that , I had a week without a job because I lost mine with the coronavirus , and I was looking for a job , doing homework , and taking courses to be better at school , and get a better job , I had bought her a stuffed kitten for our anniversary we were on quarantine so we would see each other , but she kept complaining again about me and everything , I talked to her in a really straight way and told her the facts , and the pressure I had on me , that was the unique time she apologized to me.

Afterwards I kept expericing the same problems , she would complain because of a lack of attention from me or invent something else like me talking with someone else. I was still looking for a job and really stressed , after some time , I started imagining my future and it didn't seem to be really good for me , I would get to be somehow the main provider and still had to get complains everyday because of current personality traits , I got terrified by that vision , so I started thinking about leaving her , but she was behaving well after some time so I forgot about that.

Yesterday she was really mean with me and told me things like she didn't feel that I wasnt giving her attention and that my ""I love you""s didn't felt kite real , I was heart broken , so after some really hard thinking , I decided to leave her , at 9:00 pm at night , we talked about that at the morning , so I talked I didn't left a room to discuss and I told her that we needed to end the relationship because we were not going to be okay in the future and that I didn't saw a good future with us , she in a very sad mood and of course surprised accepted my choice but not really sure about that , I wasn't to about my choice , but somehow I thought I was doing something good for my life thinking logically of course and lefting the feelings apart of my thinking , but I started feeling guilty and now I feel somehow insecure about the choice I made.

The moments I lived with her were the happiest and the saddest of my life , but I don't know if I should get back with her and give her a second chance , just because I have feelings for her.

Some useful data:

She is 18 and I'm 22 
I'm her first boyfriend
She studying law but she doesnt like it , she likes drawing and art , she is studying that because he family helped her because they teach at the uni 
She really loves me 
I still love her , but I kinda trust more my logic 

I didn't do anything bad to her physically or mentally , neither was overprotective or a toxic like boyfriend who checked her phone , we didn't do anything like that , ever. And I didn't say to her anything bad like a in a rude way or something like that , she did two or more times.

Should I get back with her and give her a second chance ?"
"My partner keeps pushing for a threesome and it’s worrying me My partner has recently started talking about wanting to have a threesome with another guy. We’ve discussed it briefly in the past and some to the understanding that both would feel uncomfortable about one having another of the same sex there so we both agreed it was a bad idea. 

Now she’s been saying that she really wants to have one with another guy, continually pressing it and saying it’s one of “her fantasies” and that “it would be a fun experience to have”. 

I love my partner with all my heart but this is a bit worrying to me as we have been completely monogamous and she’s been talking about this out of the blue and it’s getting me deeper into my own head a lot and overthinking a lot. 

She has said that she wants to do it so that she can “prove her passion and how sexy she can be  and prove that we can have fun with other people but at the end of the day she still wants only me and loves me” 

This just raised a few red flags as our relationship has been a bit on the rocky side for the past week and I’m just worrying and overthinking a lot. Any help would be greatly appreciated."
"I'm not sure if I[21F] should continue this relationship with boyfriend[23M]. Hello,

I have been in a 5 and a half year relationship, and it has been ok. There are times when I want to just break up, but there are also times when I am overjoyed with love and happiness with this person. 

I am about to graduate in a couple of weeks, and I've been so excited to see what is out there in the world and establish myself an adult, find a job, and explore the world as well! 

As much as I love my partner, he doesn't want to travel, he doesn't have any solid career goals, and its like pulling teeth to get him to spend time with me sometimes. His computer/games is his life( not to mention Quarantine has exasperated this, i'm talking literally when he wakes up until when he is ready for bed at 6am thats it) , and sometimes I feel secondary. I've gotten used to it and I feel I have accepted this but I do have thoughts of like "" what is it like to have a boyfriend who is interested in other things and has a wide variety of  hobbies outside of the computer"". 

When he does feel like showing me affection he does, and he does well. I'm just worried that no matter where we move, where we go, where our life leads, i'm going to be living it kind of alone? He has already told me that he doesn't really want to travel the world, he doesn't want to be in another country for more than a week, he doesn't really care for much else of anything outside of his games. 

Anytime I want to go do something like bowling or hiking or anything outside of the home, its really hard, and he's never been enthusiastic about it. 

I do love him, and I can see my life with him, and I would love it!He is kind, and he accepts me as I am, flaws and all. I don't mind sacrificing these things to do that, but what would you do?"
How to trust boyfriend I need advice on how to trust my boyfriend. He hasn’t done anything to not have my trust. He’s very good looking and i just get so much anxiety when it comes to friendships with other girls. My last relationship has made it very hard to have trust and I’m struggling on how to get these thoughts out of my head.
"My boyfriend doesn’t think I’m pretty He called me cute a few times when we started dating and before but now, he hurts my feelings with the stuff he says sometimes. Like saying the face I made was ugly when I wasn’t really making any face, it’s just my normal face. I have expressed to him before that I wanna get a nose job and he supported it and asked me if I thought about a boob job too.. mine are D cups so no I haven’t considered implants. I changed my mind and told him I don’t wanna do it anymore. And yesterday we were talking and he kept staring at my face and I asked him what and he said he was just imagining how I’d look with a small nose and I’d look really pretty. It kinda hurt especially since I decided I wasn’t gonna do it. We’re in quarantine now so this hasn’t happened for a while but if we went out with friends and some guy would flirt with me or wanna dance, he wouldn’t care and never stepped in and said “hey that’s my girl”. Which makes me feel like he doesn’t care about losing me. I told him how one time a guy raped me and he said that he probably thought I was another girl or couldn’t see me properly and it wasn’t 100% his fault. Idk. It just hurts. He checks out other girls and is really nice to them and he basically lets the door hit me in my face. I guess he just doesn’t make me feel good about myself. And while we were dating he tweeted “anime girls &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; real girls” which hurt a lot"
"My [24F] partner constantly fails to employ basic troubleshooting steps and is hostile when I (24M) try to remind her to do so. So this is a super small deal. When I say hostile I really mean defensive, but it does a good job of really making me depressed. I'm kind of sensitive lol. The charging port in her phone is tanked and she has to use a wireless charger. She's using a cheap one and largely charges it off laptops, which raises the problem of it not working properly. 

The problem arises when she gets mad at the technology, loudly frustrated which stresses me out, and is fairly hostile when I try to remind her that the charger does in fact work. It might not work on this older laptop's weaker usb power supply reliably, the charger might indeed be goofing up on occasion, but no matter what I say she absolutely does not run through the troubleshooting steps reliably and it kills me. 

When I try to explain to her that the situation (In this case ""not working"", but still turning blue to signify some type of handshake at play.) she's describing makes no sense given that I can very clearly see the charger attempting to make the handshake she just get's frustrated with me. It's one of those weird situations where I'm not at all trying to be condescending, but I think some fundamental and perceived condescension comes across because I try and explain every time (which works 1000% of the time) that getting mad about the thing not working when you haven't unplugged the charger for five seconds and then tried another USB port is utterly ridiculous. 

It wouldn't be a problem if she didn't also seemingly want my help every time as a solution to her frustration. It's this tenuous thing where where I have to just... let her be angry and pretend it doesn't ice my mood hella. 

This is a very small deal. I'm completely happy, this literally being the extent of our conflict after two years. But, how in the FUCK can I make it stop happening at least every other day?"
"My fiancé is always late, and is angry with me for wanting him to be more punctual My (24F) fiancé (22M) is late to everything except school (he’s a medical student, so he doesn’t have a job but if he did he would be on time to that). He was even 20 minutes late the first time he met my parents for dinner at a restaurant (and apologized). Now that we live together (we’ve been together 2.5 years) I’m also late to everything because I have to wait for him and it gives me anxiety. I don’t know if it’s because of the way I was raised (the motto in my parent’s house was 5 minutes early is on time and on time is late) or if it’s an OCD thing (I have OCD about other things, like cleaning that also bother him), but it really bothers me to not be on time. I feel like it’s rude to the people who are waiting on us, and there’s just no reason for it. I realize that there are worse things in the world than not being punctual, and I could let this go if it weren’t for his reasoning. Whenever I talk to him about it, he says things like “Why do you care? We have no obligation to these people, why does it matter if we’re late?” So it’s not about being scatter-brained or just always losing track of time, he just genuinely does not care if people are waiting on him. 

Tonight we had a Zoom double date (COVID-19 and all) planned with his best friend &amp; girlfriend for 9pm. My fiancé didn’t get out of the shower until 9:50pm (so we were already running late and let them know) and then I showered and got out and was ready to log on at 10:30. However, my fiancé was then in the mood and wanted to have sex first. I told him we were already an hour and a half late and that I couldn’t get in the mood knowing that we’re keeping them waiting. I just felt like it was rude and not respectful of their time and was feeling anxious about it. I asked if we could have sex after and he got so angry with me and said that I’m too rigid about time and he’s sick of me nagging him about it and that it doesn’t matter if we’re late or not. Maybe I am too rigid? I don’t know, but we’re currently sitting in separate rooms of the house not talking (we ended up telling our friends we needed to rain check on the date). I want to resolve this issue, but I don’t know what to do or say."
What does it mean when she doesn’t want to hang out with you but only wants to text? I’ve known this girl for awhile and I like her but she never wants to hang out only text. I get frustrated because I’m of the mindset that texting takes minimal effort and you can’t develop or further a relationship without in person interaction. I made my feelings known to her but She doesn’t agree with me. She was mostly the one to initiate contact but it was mostly no substance communication. Sometimes she would take a long time to respond back. I’m not a big fan of texting.
"My husband is always playing video games, and it’s jeopardizing our marriage. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m not even married at this point. I try not to be annoying or nag at him, and I give him his space to play his games. But he plays all day. It seems to be the first thing he thinks about in the morning and it’s the last thing he’s doing before going to sleep which is usually super late. Sometimes we don’t even sleep together because he just passes out on the couch. I do everything for him. I really don’t think I’m a bad wife. I cook all the time and I even bring him food or drinks that I’ve made into his room. When I make dinner he sometimes doesn’t even come out and by the time he does I’m already halfway done eating. Or he eats and then just leaves to go back to his game. When I try spending time with he just falls asleep. I’m trying so hard to be the most amazing wife but I don’t know what to do anymore. I spend my days alone. Every time I bring it up he gets so angry and defensive and blames everything on me. He tells me that I am annoying and that I don’t understand. He doesn’t understand what we could do if we spend time together. I just don’t know how to get through to him. I just feel like I go out of my way for him all the time and I’m not getting much in return. I wish he would take my feelings into consideration. I understand he wants to have fun I really get that but I think it’s excessive. Am I wrong to think this? Should I just let him be?"
"How to stop being the first one to initiate the conversation with my friend? Hello all, 

For the last two years I (21f) have been friends with a guy (21m) from my university. Unfortunately, for me it was never just friendship: ever since I got to know him I have developed strong feelings for him. We share a lot of interests, but over the last four months we have become much closer than we were before. 

His girlfriend left him in December for his best friend. He took it pretty hard; the first time I saw him after their breakup he was on the verge of tears. After he confided his emotions and thoughts about this to me, we started spending much more time with each other. For some time, I was under impression that he liked me too. Examples are quite silly, but still: One time he insisted on spending a night at my place, which I interpreted as him at least enjoying my company. Another time he brought me a book he wanted me to read, saying he wouldn’t give a book he hasn’t finished yet to anyone else. There were quite a lot of other minor things that suggested he fancied me. Also, when we were talking about his feelings for his ex-girlfriend, he mentioned that although he is not in love with her anymore, he would be able to move on only once he finishes the exams he missed because of their break-up. 

However, his words and promises almost never translate into action. From the way he behaves, I feel like It is not just that he doesn’t like me in a romantic sense, he doesn’t really care about me as a person at all. It was this way from the very beginning. We would spend hours together in my first year, but as the summer came and I went back to my home country he disappeared. In my second year, he wouldn’t reply to my messages for months the first semester; from time to time in the second semester, he would suggest to meet on the weekends, but then again disappear. He never mentioned he had a girlfriend until after the breakup, although he mentioned or even introduced me to his other friends. When we talked once, he mentioned something to the effect that I am his “true friend”, but it doesn’t really seem like it is the case. I have confronted him about the two months he didn’t reply to my messages, but he says it was unintentional and he didn’t realize he hurt my feelings. Now that we are all self-isolating, the situation repeats all over again. He doesn’t reply to my messages for weeks. A couple of days ago he said he would come help me move out, but I haven’t heard from since his message. He always apologizes and finds an excuse, but I don’t really believe in his apologies anymore. If he cared about me at all, wouldn’t he be more conscientious about his actions? Especially given that he knows how disappointed I am when anyone ghosts me. He never makes any effort to maintain our friendhip. It is always me seeking out him. 

He mentioned that his ex girlfriend thinks he is a narcissist and I think it very much can be the case (although I didn’t think so a couple of months ago). At least for this summer semester, I want to take some time for myself. I can’t and don’t want to ruin the friendship we have at the moment, partially because we will share responsibilities for several things at our uni next year and partially because I am still hopeful, but I really want to rest emotionally from him this summer. I am not intending to ignore him, but I want to learn not to make the first move and be able to take my mind off him. At this point, I think I am just rather spineless. For example, yesterday, after he didn’t help me with moving out, I messaged him a pretty innocent message that he could at least warn me that he wouldn’t come. Today I apologized for this message. How do I develop enough self-respect to wait for him to message me? How do I stop thinking about him (which usually leads to me messaging him)? Any advice of thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks!"
"Girlfriend (F26) told me wish wish she never met me (M24) My girlfriend and I are in a heated argument and as it was 'closing' she started saying lots of hurtful things to me. One of then being she with she never met me...

I was heartbroken with everything that was said, but especially this.

Edit: I realise the typo"
Can a break help a relationship my boyfriend and i had lots of mental issues individually and together we hurt eachother. but i love him and i know he loves me. we broke up two days ago and he said he wants to come back together after we fix ourselves. i don’t know if it will happen or if this would even actually benefit our relationship if we do.
How do I slyly ask my boyfriend if he is a virgin? I just don't want to come across too strong! I am his first girlfriend and he is 22 so just pure curiosity. 
"How do I (19M) date my (19F) bestfriend without akwordness? Me and her been bestfriends since grade 1, I do like her and she likes me. We have a long history of sexualness. I know sexting is this horrible discusting monsterous putred thing to most people (for some reason) but we've been sexting, nudes and all since grade 10 on snap even before that we where always overly sexual back in middle school and we still are messing around from time to time. Recently I said I like her and she said she did too. I'd always imagined if we dated that it would be super akward and not romance with each other. And we don't have much in common almost at all, basically shes a trendy prep I'm a skater I guess Just being friends we are akward alot?

TL;DR want to date bestfriend, we both are akward as friends though but want to date her need to know some advice?"
"My(22F) ex(20M) drank a lot So, my ex and I broke up a few months ago but we still keep in contact. It's complicated but there's no bad feelings between us. One thing that did raise a red flag for me was that he would drink A LOT. It never really changed his atttiude or behavior. He was never aggressive. He would just get very mellow. But the amount he would drink was concerning. He would drink what 2 or 3 men would drink. And it would happen fairly often. Should this be a concern?"
"Does anyone else have a fight-or-flight response when their parents speak to them? I'm (24F) back at my parent's house for quarantine, and I'm realizing that every time my parents talk to me, I avoid making eye contact, make sure to maintain some distance, I withdraw from their touch, I try to speak in short sentences, I try not to show any emotion on my face. And I notice my heartbeat is increased afterward, even if it is a simple question like ""what time does your class start today?""

Any thoughts as to why or any resources to help?"
"My (20F) boyfriend (22M) just broke up with me I’m sitting in the car crying my eyes out as I type this. We’ve only been together 6 months but I’ve never loved someone as much as I love him.

He broke up with me an hour ago in a store parking lot. We have been living together for a few months (we moved in together early, I know, but he’s my everything and we felt it was the right thing to do). When I asked him why, he said that he feels he has to be selfish in this scenario and that he feels he doesn’t have the time or emotional capacity to be in a relationship right now while he’s in school (he’s a bio major). He insisted his decision had to do with his own issues and stress right now and that he doesn’t hate me, but I can’t help but think that I stressed him out to the point where he needed to break up with me. He claims that he hasn’t been thinking about it and that it was a decision he made on the spot after deciding this morning that he could no longer be in a relationship. 

Is it even possible to decide to break up with someone within a matter of hours? How do I come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t good enough? How does someone move on knowing he’s the love of my life?"
Possibly forced to introduce bf to my mom So i started dating this guy a little over two months ago and we met before lockdowns and everything. We met at school and with the school closures i was forced to go back home across the country. We very early on were put into a long distance relationship like many others during this time. The issue now is that because of everything unless one of us flies (when its safe of course) to see the other we will have gone five months without seeing each other. Right after i came home he stated that he would like to visit me which of course i liked the idea because i wanted our relationship to grow. But the more ive thought about it it gets more complicated. For as much as i want to see him given the circumstances he would have to meet my mom because when im not in school i live with her at home. I dont think im quite ready for the whole meey the parents situation but this feels different to that given the circumstances. However it still is fundamentally him meeting my family. What should i do if he asks about visiting but i have these feelings?
"Thinking about ending it(20M) I(20M) have been in a LDR relationship with my girlfriend (21F) for almost two years now. We go to two different colleges about 3.5 hours away from eachother and we live close to eachother during the summer. We’d usually visit eachother every two werks. Due to quarantine she’s stayed at her apartment since mid march instead of coming home. I’ve asked her multiple times since January of this year to talk to me or FaceTime me more often since communication is key in LDRs. I’m lucky to have her respond to my texts or snapchats every 3/4 hours which is kinda frustrating considering shes at home all day. She’s been a great girlfriend besides that but i feel like I’ve been putting the effort into everything for the past 5 months. I’ve brought this topic up to her multiple times throughout this period and she says she’ll try hard to respond. She does respond faster for the first few days after asking then reverts to the same pattern. I’ve been thinking recently and I don’t know whether it’s worth it to deal with this for another year(we’re juniors) if she doesn’t want to put minimal effort to respond to me in a reasonable time. This seems kinda stalkerish but she’s on her phone usually but decides not to respond. She leaves her snapchat map on so it shows how recent she was on the app and shows she just doesn’t wanna respond. I love the girl but it’s making it very tough for me to make it work with her when we can’t see eachother as  frequently compared to most couples. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks"
"Got unblocked and messaged after almost 2 months . Don't know what to do? Warning, the post is longgg as I wanted to let people know what transpired between us before providing me with advice. Have TLDR on the bottom for anyone who wants to skip the rant bit. I (m) ended the friendship with my best friend (f) after the things got too toxic for us both. We were the best of friends because neither of us were attracted to each other which made it easier for us to open up to each other as there was no need to impress. We didn’t flirt or anything but we did have a good banter and rapport with each other. And we were always there for each other in time of need.

Things started to change a bit last year after she dumped her bf. She was still casually dating guys after that and I have been her wingman a few times when she needed one. I didn’t have any romantic inclination towards her. Our friendship was very good but the thing was she found every girl I found attractive to be ugly and then she’ll try to help me out with girls I had zero interest in. She also started to ask me to sit closer to her on sofa when we were at her place. It made me uncomfortable as I needed some space. One time she was drunk and she told me with a smile that she would fk me if I didn’t get a girlfriend soon. I showed disgust on my face and she quickly changed the topic and next day she told me she was too drunk to remember anything. 

I started to develop some feelings for her and I told her as we were always honest with each other and she was already in a LDR with a guy at the time. We were always honest with each other and told each other everything. She didn’t make a big deal out of it and we moved on. I felt relief and my feelings for her disappeared. She would send me pic of her and her new bf whenever she was back home and they were cute together. After the holiday we were back in Uni and she had broken up with her LDR and was talking to someone new. But she started to get jealous again. And one night her mood suddenly changed when I was talking to one of the girls I had befriended in Rowing club. I had huge my bestie and tell her that the other girl was just a friend from a club to make her cheer up again. And later that night she got me drunk and took advantage of me. She told me I started kissing her first but when I came to my senses I told her no and to stop 3 times and I also tried to put her down gently by making things awkward by telling her I don’t do ONS, how she was doing with the new guy and that I didn’t have condom on me so we should stop and just sleep. She had answers for these all and she showed me that that she was pill. She also hit me with “I love you. Be with me. Don’t worry about anything.” I didn’t know what to do. I wanted her to be happy so I slept with her. But it just felt so wrong. The next day I slept in because I didn’t know what to do as I felt like shit. She seemed to be okay and was smiling. Before I left to go back to mine I was stupid enough to ask her “Do you also regret last night”. She just hid her face under the duvet. 

And I leave for my home, felt sick, cried my eyes out. I felt like I had taken advantage of her.  Later on she messaged me saying she can’t think she can be friends with me anymore and I ask her out of desperation as I still wanted her in my life (and I thought that she liked me more than a friend because of what she did and told me the night before). She rejected me and said we should just be friends. She does this 2 more times before wishing me well and saying we can’t be friends anymore. She then blocked me. I understood why she blocked me but I was very depressed and lost appetite for a few days. I lost around 9lbs in a single week. Her friend messaged me and called me saying that she wants to talk with me. I didn’t do anything as I was just starting to feel a bit better. But then she called me herself and we met up. She was drunk and she kept checking me out and flirting while saying she wants to see my room and bed. I took her back home and the next day I asked her out as I realised I still had some feelings for her. She said no as she doesn’t do well in relationship and she doesn’t want to hurt me. She also told me that I should go and see other girls. She also asked me to never talk about what happened between us. I was happy as I really liked more like a friend. I asked her to give me some space for a few days as I still had some feelings for her and I didn’t want to be around her when I had those feelings as that would just mess up our friendship and she deserved a friend not some dude waiting for his chance with her. She agreed but 2 days later she blocked me again after she told me I was being weird for not being to get over her. She messaged a few days later and we made up as I was over her. I really wanted to apologise to her about my behaviour that night as I felt guilty every time I was with her. But then she tells me that she doesn’t regret what happened between us that night. I didn’t reply. I tried to set healthy boundaries but she won’t have any of it. She also started to get jealous and started playing love songs when it was just us. She tried to get me jealous a few times and it worked. Even though she was dancing with this guy she would just make an intense eye contact with me every 4-5 mins and followed me everywhere with this guy. I basically ruined the night and I shouldn’t have done what I’ve done. I told her that I liked her and I wanted to be with but she just said that she doesn’t think of me in that way and I should move on. I tried to apologise to her about my behaviour because just because I was drunk and jealous doesn’t mean I should have acted that way. 

When we met again I tried to apologise to her but she blamed everything on me, saying I was jealous and ruined everything. And she also told me that I took advantage of her that night and have been taking advantage of her friendship. And told me that she didn’t want to reconnect after what happened between us but her friends told her give me another chance. I could not take it anymore because when she told me that I took advantage of her the guilt I was carrying got firmly established. The next day, I apologised to her about my behaviour and taking advantage of her trust. I ended the friendship because I was hurting her too much. She then blocked me, even my phone as I texted her to say I had left her notepad at the reception. Around 2 week or so, I see her in house party. I avoid her at all cost. Later on I get told by her friends that she got thrown out by host after punching host’s friend. I was drunk and stupid so I txted her. It went through and she was basically accusing me not giving shit about her as I had not reached out to her for almost a fortnight and I can’t talk to her whenever I wanted. She also told me that I had a lovely week and I was having a blast as I was talking and dancing with some girls. And she also told me she was self-harming. I tried to stop her but it was no use. Went to her place but she won’t let me in. I kept in touch with her for a few more days to make sure she was doing okay but all I got was stop talking to me and I completely stopped talking to her after I found out from a mutual friend that she was doing okay. I also stopped because it was just cruel to keep talking to her after ending the friendship with her. I know I shouldn’t have txted her.

That was almost 2 months ago. I have since changed my phone no and she has too much of pride to unblock someone and talk to them  eg. Her friends and exes(or so I thought but she always unblocked and contacted me). I was very anxious as I thought that she might contact me but after a month I moved on and was feeling better as she didn’t contact me and I was still blocked. I lost my phone so I had to get a new one and I also got the opportunity to get a new phone number. She dmed me on 1 May the Friday night asking how I was doing and that she had sent me messages and she was waiting for my reply. I didn’t reply to her message took me by complete surprise. She has also friended me on FB and added me on Snap. I was thinking of what to do but one of our mutual friend messaged me asking how I was the very next day. So I blocked them both. But I have no idea what to do as I really want to message her and ask how she is. I also seem to really care about her and want to give her another chance but I feel like we’ll end up like this again. And I’ll see her again because we are both go to same uni and study same course. I have no idea what to do as I’m really really want to reply to her as I want to know why she is reaching out after so long. But I know that if I reply to her we’ll just go back to being friends again or something. And I’m like 60% sure the history will repeat again. I don’t want to hurt her and I don’t want to hurt me. 

I’m curious about why she messaged me after blocking me for 7weeks and if should give our friendship another go? After we slept together it only took 1 month for things to turn this ugly. I stuck with her for that 1 month because we were both confused and I thought some time and honest talk would heal us as we had been good, supportive friends for 2 years. We could talk to each other about everything and be honest and express ourselves as we never judged each other and had accepted each other’s strength and flaws. We always listened to understand the other person and we have never had any argument before as we both respected each other’s point of view. We were supportive of each other and always motivated the other one do well.  I didn’t want to end it just because we were having a shit week which turned into a month. Thought we could go back to being friends like before again but it got messed up even more so I ended the friendship after enduring it for a month. I really miss our times before things went and I guess I’m hoping we could go back to it again. I know it’s a wishful thinking.   

Damn, wish I could write this many words in my assignment without any problem. Sorry for any grammatical and spelling error.

TLDR; Had to end friendship with a good friend after catching feelings and playing games ruined our friendship and made it toxic in a month. She has unblocked me and reached out to me so I don’t know what to do? Have questions like why did she unblock and message me after almost blocking me for 2 months and if should respond back to her even at the risk of being friends again (and going through with this again)

And I want to thank you all for your time and replies"
"What do I (F22) do about these intense feelings about my boyfriend (M22) Hi! obligatory long time lurker, first-time poster. I want to start off by saying this is in no way shape or form a bad thing. The intense feeling I have is really, really good. This is gonna be a long'un, but I hope a happy advice post will cheer some people up! and honestly I need help because I might explode, lol. 

So just to give some backstory, I met my boyfriend (We'll call him Z here) on Tinder in July of 2017. I was at my best friend's house (I met her in college and she quickly became my best friend. she lived an hour and a half away from me, so I'd visit her all the time), swiping on Tinder in her hammock and I came across his profile. We spoke all day, doing little bits and weird pickup lines while my friend and I frolicked at the beach. It was an amazing day. We talked to each other every day, and we found out a lot of things about each other. I was going to college in New Jersey, where we were both from, and Z was in college in Texas. We were hesitant to fall for each other because of the distance, but... we weren't too great at resisting, obviously lmao. I remember the day we admitted that we both liked each other, and even now it's giving me butterflies (I was in the group chat with the girls F R E A K I N G out lol). We still were hesitant to make things official, although we had been exclusive (was not agreed to between us, but somehow we both decided that we would delete our dating apps and stop seeing other people soon after we met). 

One day Z told me that he had Asperger's. He admitted one of the reasons he was hesitant to date me was because he was afraid I would misunderstand what it would be like to love him. That night, I did so much reading on Asperger's, relationships, triggers, etc. I would text him intermittently, asking about his experience to compare it to what I was reading. I kept a little notebook of things I found. I bookmarked pages about it all. I wasn't going to let not knowing stop me from dating Z. We made things official on April 20th of 2018, which was also an amazing day. School ended for the summer soon after that, and we spent the whole summer together. We went back to school in August, I graduated in May of 2019, and in June, packed myself up and moved to Texas to live with him while he finished his last year of school. 

The last 11 months have been hard, I won't lie. I was in a job where I was overworked (late nights every day of every week, had to give up a lot of weekends, ungrateful clients and managers, etc.) and severely underpaid. Making friends was, and still is, proving to be very difficult. our apartment building had (has) a roach problem that the landlords weren't (and still aren't) taking care of. A few of my friends from NJ commit suicide in the same week, within days of each other, and I couldn't go to their funerals. I got laid off from that shit job due to the pandemic and didn't know whether to jump for joy, cry my eyes out, or rage (spoiler alert: it was all three). Throughout all of this, Z was always there. He'd hold me tight when I cried, he'd be at the door with a hug, kiss, and glass of wine on particularly rough days at work. Our relationship was always strong. We’ve had our misunderstandings, but no blowout arguments. I loved coming home to him. He has been my rock through so much. Because of him, there has been a lot of good stuff for me in Texas too. 

We slow dance in the kitchen when we cook together. 

We've been able to talk and bond so much more since the start of the quarantine. 

We got a cat in January and we love her like she's our daughter. 

Y'all, I've honestly never had a relationship this good. I've had a few relationships - some short, some long, and I've had my fair share of ""Wow, this person is awesome"", but today, every time I look at my boyfriend and my first thought is ""I want to love you for the rest of my life"". I've never had that with anyone else, and it's both inherently amazing/beautiful/awesome, and also kinda scary, in a way. That's obviously a very intense feeling to have about someone, but I honestly would love to marry him one day. That revelation has my mind and body doing some *shit* \- it feels almost like a panic attack but in the best way possible? Heart racing, butterflies in the stomach, etc etc. Although I know this is a for a good reason, the feeling is super intense and a lil confusing lol, which brings me to my questions.

A) What do I do with these intense feelings/What do I do with this revelation?

B) this one might be dumb, but is 22 too young to know who you want to spend the rest of your life with?  Is there a right time?

C) not a question, but feel free to post your love/marriage stories! 

I know this isn't what usually gets posted here, but I do need help because like I said above, I feel like I'm gonna explode lol.  Many thanks in advance for the advice. 

Thanks for the long read, but for my skimmers: 

tl;dr: I looked at my boyfriend of two years today and realized I want to marry him, and can't stop thinking about it, which is lovely and scary all at the same time. Wondering what to do with this revelation now that I have it, and whether there's a right time for this stuff. Also open to hearing other love stories!"
"How can I(17) get over the fact my girlfriend(16) had a relationship before me I don’t know if this fits this subreddit, but it seemed the best to go to. I’ve been with this girl for about 7 months now, and I really care about her, but it’s been hard for me to get over the fact that she’s cared about people before me. I understand how selfish that is, and no matter what I’ll love her in spite of that. I was sent to a board school for middle school, and she’s my first real relationship, and I guess I can’t get over the fact that I might just be another guy to her. I’m sorry if this comes off as selfish and ridiculous, but this has honestly been tearing me up inside recently. I’m just wondering if anybody’s experienced anything like this, and if they got over it"
"I (23F) found out my (28M) boyfriend has been in contact and flirting with one of his ex’s through our relationship of almost a year and I don’t know how to bring it up with him. I apologize, this post is going to be long. I’ve not been in this situation before and I’ve not been able to talk about this with anyone so I am giving the full story...

I moved across the country last year to a city where I practically know no one for work. I was single so I went on some dates with people and was trying to expand my friend group. In the process of this I ended meeting one of my coworkers best friends at a party. I’ll call him J. I hardly knew anyone at the party but J came up and started talking to me. He was funny and we ended up clicking pretty well and he made the party fun. We exchanged numbers and continued to talk for the next couple of weeks. I was not looking for a relationship but he seemed very interested in me and even flirty at times. This ended up progressing and we ended up having dinner together where some of my coworkers were present, and that night we slept together for the first time.

A week later, J invited me over for dinner with just us. When I came over, he told me he wanted to be honest with me. He told me when we started talking he was still dating his ex of 3 years but had broken up with her before we slept together. He also told me he had cheated twice on his ex with two different girls. I asked him why and he told me she was not good at communicating and would ignore him to the point he felt like he wasn’t even in a relationship. Despite this she was still pushing for marriage and he knew he did not want that with her but it took him meeting me to realize that. He also mentioned that she is very religious and did not want to have sex before marriage which was very difficult for him to deal with but said that it was not an excuse for him to cheat. He’s told me more about her since then, I know they don’t have much in common and I know his friends did not care for her very much. She texts him and calls him pretty frequently which bothered me at first, but he doesn’t usually respond and now I understand the nature of their relationship and that he does not want to get back together with her.

We continued to talk and a couple months in everything was going great. J travels a lot for work so he’s usually gone during the week and home on the weekends. During the weeks he’d stay in contact with me and during the weekend he’d stay with me at my place. Along the weeks he was gone, I did notice he followed a lot of Instagram models and would like and comment on their pictures. This bothered me but at the time I let it slide since we weren’t in a super serious relationship, we were just dating and I felt I could trust him. 

As I got to know him more I realized that I did want to move towards being in a relationship and since we were sleeping together I thought it would be appropriate to ask if he was still talking to and or seeing other people because I wasn’t. He became a little nervous and started to avoid the question but I kept pushing because I felt like if we are sleeping together on a regular basis I had a right to know at least for health reasons. He told me there were two girls he had been previously talking to and the they messaged him but he hadn’t been responding to them that much. His answer was pretty vague beyond that, but he implied he would stop messaging them.  Part of me was upset he was still talking to other people, but the other half knew I couldn’t be upset as we hadn’t talked about our expectations previously and it was early in our relationship. I also wanted to avoid conflict during the short amount of time I got to spend with him in real life so I stopped pushing for information and we moved on.

Another month passed and I ended up going to Vegas to visit him on a work trip for my birthday and he helped pay for most of it. We had been spending a ton of time together and constantly texting and everything felt so natural. I’ve had some bad experiences in the past but with J it felt different, he seemed to fall just as fast and shared the same energy I had. On our last day I had a little too much to drink and I wanted him to know my feelings, I told him I really cared about him and that I was not interested in anyone else. I ended up saying I loved him but I told him he didn’t have to say it back, I just wanted my feelings to be understood. He did not say it back, but did not seem upset or weirded out. We went home together and everything continued as normal, I just felt stupid for getting drunk and saying I love you so quickly. 

A week after we got back from Vegas he ended up going on a 3 week trip to Mexico with his family and would be gone for Halloween which I was sad about, but he said he would miss me and stay in contact. During this time we communicated a lot on social media, we mostly used instagram to send each other messages and memes. I hardly ever use twitter but every now and then I log on to scroll through. One day I logged in and I saw something funny and I wanted to send it to him but I realized he didn’t follow me back. When I looked at his profile I saw that he had openly and actively been flirting with some random girl on Twitter during the time he was in Mexico. My heart sank as again I thought we were exclusive at that point. I confronted him with screenshots of all the flirtatious tweets they exchanged and he profusely apologized and said he wanted to earn my trust back. After a few days of me trying to gather my thoughts and feelings I responded to him and forgave him on a couple of conditions. I told him that he needed to earn my trust and that I was not comfortable with him Interacting with other women online or with hundreds of Instagram pages where women post scantily clad pictures. He told me he would unfollow them and be more open with me because he respected and deeply cared about me.

A week or so later he finally told me he loved me back and that he held off saying it because he quickly jumped from one relationship to the next. We moved on and he introduced me to his family, I’ve met most of his friends and I even ended up meeting his coworkers. In December right before Christmas we decided to finally use the titles boyfriend and girlfriend. 

Skip to this year, we are now in quarantine have been trapped in my apartment for almost 2 months now. He doesn’t travel for work anymore and has pretty much moved into my apartment so we spend every day together and are hardly apart. During this time I’ve been feeling incredibly depressed about work, life and the current pandemic. I’ve been open with him about this as it’s also been affecting my sex drive, and I’ve told him I’m scared if we stop having sex as often he’ll look for more available sources. He’s been super supportive and understanding, he’s assured me there is no one else and that he wouldn’t, but I’ve started to feel my insecurities creep back.  I’ve tried to communicate my feelings the best I can and be open with him because I know the lack of communication in his last relationship was difficult for him.

The past week I’ve noticed he still follows a decent chunk of the accounts I asked him to unfollow and I felt like he was starting to be more secretive with his phone. One night he had accidentally left his phone in my room while he was out playing video games. My anxiety and insecurity had got the best of me and I’d seen his passcode from over his shoulder so I did the wrong thing and snooped. I looked at his Instagram messages, his twitter messages, texts, and finally his snap chat and fb. Snap chat and Facebook was where I found things.

It turns out he had been actively been messaging an ex he dated in college through the entire beginning of our relationship and even after we became boyfriend and girlfriend. He had briefly mentioned her before when we were talking about our exes and he told me that it ended up not working out with her because she was from a culture where her parents would not approve of her dating him. He told me that when he was with her he was ready to do anything to make it work but her family would not let it happen. I saw on his snap chat he had messaged that girl near my birthday saying he was going to Vegas and she expressed she wanted to come and he said he wanted to make her cum. I found messages showing that she was one of the girls he had cheated on his last ex with. I saw on his Facebook messages and around Christmas they were talking politics and she said she wanted him to run for president so she could be his mistress. He was not flirty in his response but he hearted her message. I saw all of this and started shaking. The last time they were in communication on snap chat was about 2 months ago.

I don’t know how to bring this up to him, it’s been eating me alive. Our Vegas trip meant a lot to me and I felt like I opened up to him and I can’t believe he would think that it would be appropriate to talk to an ex like that especially after he told me he wasn’t talking to anyone. I feel like I’ve been lied to and tricked. When I previously found his flirty tweets I had asked him if he would be okay if I talked to other people like that at that point in our relationship and he said no.

I feel like we’ve talked about these issues multiple times and I really don’t know what to do at this point. I have pictures of his messages. I love him and I don’t want to end the relationship but at the same time I have no idea what his feelings are towards her and I don’t know how to bring it up without admitting I invaded his privacy. I shouldn’t have snooped but I don’t know what to do with the information I’ve found... every other aspect of our relationship is great. He’s loving and caring and for the most part he makes me feel good about myself, but these past couple weeks I’ve felt lost. I’m afraid if I don’t bring it up it will continue because of his past cheating, especially when he starts to travel for work again."
"My (29M) relationship with my wife (27F) is absent of any sort of sexual intimacy Sorry for any formatting issues, on mobile. 

My wife and I have been together for 7 years, married for 3. Prior to being in a relationship with her we were part of a mutual friend group for about 3 years. She is a fantastic partner and friend, but is our relationship is completely void of any sort of sexual intimacy or excitement, and has since the beginning of our relationship. We went straight from making out to having sex, and have done nothing in between. In all the time we’ve been together she’s never performed oral sex on me, and she’s only allowed me to do it once.  I’ve never fingered her, and handjobs only come when she reaches a point where she feels guilty (I never put the guilt on her, tell her it’s perfectly fine and honestly I wouldn’t want to be doing anything with someone that isn’t into it also). 

I’m someone with a very high sex drive, so this has been difficult on me. In addition to the lack of variety in our sex lives, there is also a lack of frequency. I’d say we have sex maybe once or twice per month on average.  This results in me masturbating at least every day, sometimes multiple times. She’s aware of this. 

I’ve brought this up to her on several occasions, and she always says that she both knows it’s an issue and wants to address it, but nothing ever comes of those situations. I probably wouldn’t be so confused if she just said that it’s just that she has a low sex drive and it’s nothing personal, but she’s never told me that.  Before we were dating in college I know that she wasn’t opposed to going out to parties and going home with guys, so that just makes me feel like it’s a “me” issue. 

I’ve tried to make it lighthearted and easy for her, doing things like sending her a dirty snapchat when I know that she’s by herself at home, but she never will send anything back because she says it makes her uncomfortable. I’ve tried apps and websites like UpgradeMojo to try to get more on the same page but again, nothing comes of it. I went out and bought a board game for couples thinking that that might be a more relaxing environment but it’s been over a year and we’ve never played it. 

I’m looking for advice on how I can explain to her that I feel like this is becoming more and more of a serious issue in our relationship. I love the woman to death and honestly think she’s perfect for me, but it’s really taking a toll on my confidence and self esteem. I feel unattractive and unwanted. 

Any help would be appreciated."
"I (18F) have gotten closer with a friend (18M) and we connect uncannily, but I think I've been put on the back-burner. I've known him for two years and we have only recently gotten closer as a few of our mutual friends are older and have moved on to college/uni. He lives about an hour and a half away, so when we hangout it is usually planned a few days ahead and we spend all day together doing random things. His body language and actions towards me tells me he is interested i.e touching me when he is demonstrating how someone did in a story he is telling, or paying extremely close attention to me at all times, telling me everything that is on his mind and even ideas or thoughts he has that he is a bit insecure about ; being very open with me. We are so alike it is crazy, I hardly have time to get a thought out before he is saying it. 

I've never known a boy do these kinds of things unless they were interested. 

At the moment I am pretty sure he is talking to another girl from what I have gathered from social media etc. we used to talk constantly and always with substance in our messages/calls, but now I talk to him every four days or so. (I also keep in mind that we are all effected differently in quarantine, but I don't enjoy it :(  ) 

I'm pretty sure he is saving me for a 'rainy' day, and it is frustrating because he is so genuine and a great guy who treats me like a queen. 

I'm not sure what to really do, especially because he is talking to another girl who lives in his town. 

What should I do/ where should I go from here?"
"My girlfriend (21F) has told me she has borderline personality disorder and I’m not sure how to react/help We’ve been seeing each other for a few months and I’m really happy. I’ve noticed we have little spats and quickly get over it, a little more than most relationships I’ve been in, but never over anything serious. 

She confided in me today that she was diagnosed with BPD when she was 12 and said that she hopes it doesn’t make me think twice about our relationship. 

I know nothing about BPD and was hoping for some help. I started reading a book on it today but was hoping on getting some help from some of you, maybe one of you have this disorder or know someone that does. Any comments or tips would be great. Thank you."
"I am friendzoned I am 22 years old studying in a college, i feel in love with a girl we often go outside have fun, go for long drive we were pretty close with each other, everything was great. Then this covid situation happened we were quarantined in our home. For first few weeks everything was great we almost talked for hours on phone about how we were having a great time(we had romance and there was electricity between us but we didn't had sex just to be clear) and then slowly our conversation starts to get shorten.. She was at her home, being an Indian family we have lots of people surrounded by that might be one of the cause of our conversation being less but the I started to feel alone, I miss her so much, I want our relationship like before but she cannot give me that much time now, I am staying in a apartment alone(I cannot make it my family because of lockdown) that makes the situation so much worse.
           One day out of fear of loosing her i proposed her and she said I am with you always but i can't be in relationship right now(she had a past but she broke up a year ago) basically I am friendzoned and then things are not like before, she also puts effort of comforting me that she is with me, but the thing is she don't want relationship, as I am alone all the time I couldn't stop thinking of her,I want everything to be like before, butthe quarantine situation has made it worse.
        bottom line is she friendzoned me but also she says i am there for you everytime but don't want bf gf thing!we talked for hours before now it reduced to minutes but she never missed a day asking me ""how are you? R u okay"" but the thing is i want more time of her, I have lost my intrest in all other things, I can't stop thinking of her I love her so much!! 
      Plz suggest me what do you think of her, do I have a chance and what should I do in this situation"

There's this guy that used to go to my highschool 2-3 (maybe even 4) years ago and we were kind of friends but anyways, he keeps hitting me up.

He was a junior in high school when I was in 7th grade (so I was 12 and he was maybe 16-18) and I first knew him because we were in summer school together and he sat next to me. (the Elementary, Middle and High schools are connected in my area, the whole school district) .Not gonna lie, BACK THEN I thought he was cute and I had a hard crush on him because he used to mess around an tease me playful but I never tried to pursue him because I was just a kid. After summer school, I saw him when I had some of my classes in the high school, we messed with eachother and he took me home from school sometimes but nothing more.

Flashforward to early last summer: I had him on my Snapchat because he added me from mentions and I wasn't trying to be a bitch and not add him back( he's 21 well out of highschool, I'm 15 at this time) and he slid up on one of my pictures with heart eyes saying something like ""you're cute"" 
I just said ""thank you"" as a reply because I wasn't the tad bit interested in him anymore. 
But then, he asked me how old I was. I replied saying I was fifteen and he said  ""damn you're really young but cute😍 you wanna talk? U can't tell anyone tho because I'll get in trouble.""
I slid over so I can see the message without actually opening it and I was disgusted. There's a few reasons why I didn't wanna talk to this dude

1. HE WAS 21
2. NOT ATTRACTED TO HIM AT ALL ANYMORE
3. HE FUCKED/ DATED ONE OF MY FRIENDS WHO IS ALSO UNDERAGE WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER STORY WITHIN ITSELF

So I actually open the message then and made up a lie saying I was talking to someone which I wasn't. he didn't go crazy he took it well and actual respected it.

But the next day he starting calling me on Snapchat at 6am on a Saturday and I was so confused.. I asked him why was he calling me and he said he wanted to talk..? I replied asking what was there to talk about and he got mad saying ""nevermind...bye..""

Never heard from him again after that until recently he found my Facebook, liked all my photos, sent me a couple of love GIFs and heart emojis and he even texted my number. I'm 16 going on 17 and he's 22 I think. I cannot make this up.

I don't wanna block him and be mean... what should I do?"
"My [21F] mother [53F] is accusing me of trying to steal my father’s [53M] money Due to the coronavirus, I have been laid off from my paid internship and I no longer have income for food or my expensive medication. My father owns his own business and is very successful and has not been hit by the virus and still makes the same amount of money. Therefore, he has been giving me ~$300 a month to get by. 

His business is relatively new though and he has not always made this much money, well into 6 figures. My mom has become money crazy ever since my dad has gained this new income. She constantly demands tropical vacations, they’ve bought 3 new motorcycles, she wants new everything and she’s becoming resentful against my father that he’s not making MORE money so she can retire from her job before 60.  

My mother and I do not have the best relationship, I feel comfortable in saying she is very manipulative and probably a narcissist, everything has to be about her. She is also a habitual cheater and manipulates and gaslights my father into believing any lie she tells him. 

Anyway to the point, she’s been telling my father that she’s sick of supporting me and my older [23F] sister who is in law school (they do not pay for her school but they help her out on rent *sometimes*. She’s also been telling my sister that I’m cheating my dad out of his money and that I’m lying about not having money (I have no clue why she thinks I’m lying, I barely make it by with the money he gives me because my medicine is so expensive and I have so many doctors appointments due to a health condition). 

I’m afraid because she has such a hold on my father he will cut me off or he will start to resent me because my mother bugs him so much about this. How can I nip this in the bud without causing more issues with my mother. I’m not opposed to talking with her but she will become very defensive and probably not take it well. 

TLDR; mother is gaslighting and manipulating my father and telling him that I’m taking advantage of his money"
"Insight into dragged out fights and forgiveness Hi there, I'm not looking for any *breakup* or *stick with it* calls, but would just like to hear your experience if you've gone through something similar as I have for guidance, thanks.

So, I often feel like a shty bf because my gf gets angry for hours and hours on end for my mistakes. (Let me clarify, this itself isn't weird) It's generally not intended to be harmful on my part, but I make errors and I try to own up to them with her. I don't try to prop myself up if I indeed messed up. But no matter how I accept my wrongdoings, gf drags it out and it stresses me out incredibly. 

I find it hard to understand because I forgive and move on from my gf's mistakes asap because I don't want to fight with her, but it seems like it's the opposite with her. She has literally said to me that she wanted to drag it out because she felt like my apology wasn't enough :(
On the one hand, she can rightfully be angry at me for messing up. But for those of you out there who understand better, can you clarify?
Is this a personality trait or difference in attitudes? Do I just need to work on myself and this will improve or will I keep feeling like a shty bf due to some aspect? Am I overreacting or is she? Is this normal or somewhat toxic?
Please speak from personal experience if possible, thank you for your help. Still young and trying to figure things out."
"How do I approach subject of women's underwear in my (F) bf's drawer? This isn't a huge problem as I don't think he's cheating. But I want to know if he's hanging onto his ex's underwear for some reason. Clean underwear, I should mention. So I feel kinda psycho bringing it up at all but this discovery makes me sad/angry and I'm afraid I'll just stay mad if I don't address it. 

I wasn't snooping btw we live together and share drawers, the underwear was in the back of this large like flip-up drawer (dunno what it's called...ottoman?) so it could have been there a long time. 

If only he were secretly wearing it. That would be hot. Don't think so tho."
"waiting for a year or two? Has anyone ever experienced “waiting” from a low level dating situation where you really liked the person but sort of expected to hear from them since the ball is in their court? I always thought so, big is two years crazy? My real question is, “has anyone actually in a situation like that been happy with the person?” Because i know it’s happened in some form or fashion..."
"My (31f) Dad(68m) left for a while when I was about 4, found out he was chasing an 18 yr old girl. Not sure how to feel or what to do &amp;#x200B;

So when I say 'found out' I think my mum already told me years ago but it just came up again last night. In therapy I've been going over some early childhood stuff, I realised how little I remember about this 10 month(ish) period when my Dad left. I wanted to know how much I saw my Dad during this time, how long it was, how much I saw my half brothers etc. Mum explained when Dad left, where he stayed etc. I remembered bits of this place as I did see my Dad here and there. Then I remembered her telling me before that some young woman was involved. I can't remember if I asked or not last night but she basically said my Dad had become 'infatuated' with some 18 year old girl who worked in his office. I was obviously alarmed...my Dad was 40 at this stage. In my alarmed state I asked what the hell was going on etc. She then said my Dad denied that there was ever a 'relationship' between him and this girl, merely that things weren't going well in the marriage and he just became infatuated with her. My Dad came back and they had marriage councelling but got divorced a few years later. My parents are civil, things have been generally happy in the family for the last few years. I've maintained a relationship with my Dad and he's generally a very loving caring father, I've always known he's flawed though.

Things going through my head right now:

1. Did my Dad seriously abandon us because he had a crush on some teenager? SHould I dwell on it being that he did come back and go through marriage councelling? I never consciously 'felt' abandoned by him but this makes it feel worse somehow.
2. How do I gain respect for my Dad after knowing this? The girls age makes me really uncomfortable but I can't tell if I'm blowing it out of proportion.
3. I feel like I shouldn't know this and that my Mum probably shouldn't have told me. Perhaps it isn't any of my business.
4. Do I ask my Dad about this?

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas what I should do? Do I need to 'resolve' this? I plan to bring it up in therapy but my session isn't for another week and I keep thinking about it.

Extra info:  I remember much more about the final divorce stage when I was older and have gone over a lot of that and reflected on it. My Mum kinda overshared with me about that situation too. I never really got mad at my Dad because I missed him and he is a sensitive quiet man, I never percieved him as a 'player' or neglegent father or anything but rather a slightly lost, blundering person."
"I can't explain why I cried Hi first time poster here. And stuff here where I am is opening up. Also to point out due to family stuff, I have my nephew. So my moms kinda going to the hospital and stuff for my sister who had leukemia and is going into chemotherapy next month. So I cannot leave my nephew with anyone to just watch. My mom was suppose to watch him tonight but my sister gets out on sunday and she didnt wanna take a chance as I still work out on the field. My boyfriend goes to see his friend once a week at his house. Normally it doesn't bother me  they go and get drunk, he comes home in the morning. But I was suppose to go today. Honestly I'm a mix in going cuz of the virus but and my introvert personality. Bug I was going to go but I didnt cuz of my nephew. No one could watch him. (And we had a long talk about this as well so no worries on that). But I asked about ten minutes ago how was it there and he said they were gonna go somewhere and watch the sunset(him and his friend, his name is A), don't worry before people say something weird, they are just good friends who have the same interests. And I just dont know I got sad and started crying. I didn't want to stop him from seeing his friend because I could not be there.

I do not understand why this made me cry. He sees him once a week."
am i communicating too much so me and my boyfriend (both 15) both have snapchat and that’s our main way of communicating. we send each other good morning texts and goodnight texts. we talk all day sometimes it’s just pictures back and forth or us arranging our plans or just talking. is this communicating too much? i don’t want to tarnish our relationship because we always talk too much. i don’t mind it but when i look it up it says stuff about adults which in my opinion won’t be the same for teenagers. so can someone tell me if we’re communicating too much?
"Is This Weird? Hey everyone how are you all doing, so I got a big question so me and my girlfriend whenever we are on call there is always something up like always at the same time for example my leg would be in pain and it's a weird feeling and same with hers, is it true love or something or am I high off my head?"
"My three closest friends (F21) are getting engaged in their senior year of college and expecting a wedding come graduation. I (F21) am genuinely struggling to be supportive. Should I be unconditionally supportive? Or can I voice my concerns respectfully? Please bear with me as I need to get this off my chest and cannot speak to my normal support group about the subject.

I (F21) recently returned from a semester abroad to learn that my three closest friends (all F21), particularly my best friend, are getting engaged. While I was initially happy, when I discovered their reasoning, I struggled to support them. I genuinely want to be happy for them. However, I believe the decision to be, a product of the fascination with weddings and not a lifetime partnership. These women are incredibly smart, graduating with engineering degrees, and will give up their financial independence before they turn 23. Moreover, they are still in the process of growing, learning to love themselves, and really discovering who they are and what they stand for.

For the sake of brevity, I will focus on my best friend ""Hailey."" Hailey started dating the love of her life last year after being friends with him for 2 years. I have no doubt they are meant to be together. The two demonstrate such joy for each other that they uplift everyone around them. Her grades, her mental health, her physical fitness, and her love for life has improved so much since dating. And above all, they are so ridiculously attracted to one another. I am so happy Hailey found him.

However, she's Catholic, and he's converting to Catholicism for her. I ask that you please consider this from Hailey's perspective and avoid criticizing the religion as that is not a productive dialogue for this situation. Hailey firmly believes in no sex before marriage. I respect her decision. One of the reasons I admire her so much is the woman always stands up for what she believes in. Her reason to get married is due in part to how much she wants to have sex with her partner. Seriously, their sexual tension is insane! I sent her videos made by God is Grey, a YouTuber critical of Catholic views on sexuality. Those videos helped me overcome the Catholic guilt and dehumanization after my sexual assault. I did not mention to Hailey that the videos pertained to sex before marriage. She and I love discussing church history and policy, and I hoped the videos would help her reevaluate her decision to get married in part due to sex.

Moreover, it's very clear that my friends have not done any research regarding the legal and financial implications of marriage. Marriage is a legal contract that poses a great risk to financial independence, particularly for women. Now, my friends and I bonded over mutual aspirations to become career women. My best friend and I have dreams of becoming doctors. However, ever since she received the average MCAT score, she's completely backed down from applying to medical school. I offered to talk through her anxieties, study with her over the summer, take EMT classes together, or whatever other tangible solutions might help her through this hard time.

I think that the wedding plans serve as a stress reliever. Getting an average MCAT score was a huge blow to her ego, and planning for the future during a global pandemic is obviously stressful. However, when we're browsing Pinterest for wedding ideas, I'll ask if her and her partner have discussed finances (prenup, joint account, how to pay for the wedding, etc), her medical school, and his graduate school. She's made it clear that no, they have not talked about it and she does not want to talk about it. When she says this, I do not push the issue further. This is not a subject I bring up often as we have only had 3-4 brief discussions.

Despite all this, I want to be supportive of her. However, I do not believe she should be rushing into a wedding after 1 year of dating. I suggested they get engaged in the fall and have a long engagement, so that they may live together, finish their educations, and become financially stable. My concern ultimately arises from her loss of financial independence, giving up on her dreams of medical school, and becoming fixated on the idea of a wedding and not a lifelong partnership. Additionally, I think my three friends are all feeding each other's decisions, pressuring them all to be wed when each friend is at unique stages in her relationship.

I have also considered that I might be projecting my own biases. Hailey's last response has propelled me to write this post to see if I am the one at fault. She accused me of being jealous as I was eternally single (I have no desire to date), bitter as I cannot have children (I have endometriosis RIP), and that I was projecting my trust issues because of my sexual assault (big oof). I have reexamined our past conversations countless times in my head and am trying to figure out if I've done something to hurt or offend her that would propel her to say these things.

Am I projecting my insecurities? Am I projecting my concerns of my best friends giving up on their career aspirations? Or am I ignorant to assume that they will suffer a financial/career setback by marrying young? Should I be supportive unconditionally? Or is there a way to respectfully voice my concerns? Any and all comments/criticism is appreciated. Thank you for reading the entirety of my post!!! I truly appreciate your help.

TL;DR - My best friend is getting married immediately after graduation for reasons I believe to be born out of her desire to have sex, a fixation on a wedding instead of a partnership, and the stress of facing career setbacks due to the MCAT/pandemic. Should I be supportive unconditionally? Or is there a way to respectfully voice my concerns?"
"I broke up with my boyfriend because he wanted distance all of a sudden. Did I do the right thing? I'm having trouble telling myself I made the right decision. \*THIS IS LONG I AM SORRY\*

Well, it started around 6 months ago. My (25F) boyfriend (24M) and I work together at a local bar. I've worked there for about 4 years and I manage and bartend and he's worked there since November as a bartender. (It's a super laid back college bar and we have a blast)

We started seeing each other around Thanksgiving and immediately realized we had a lot in common. The problem at the time with us was the fact I still lived with my ex boyfriend of 2 years. Shortly after seeing said boyfriend, my ex found out and moved. During this time I was very confused with what to do and my now boyfriend (Z) slept with two other women during the talking/going out on dates process before officially boyfriend and girlfriend. I forgave him because I couldn't commit really, and decided I wanted to so we could be togetehr. We started dating in February. So over the last few months I have noticed quite a bit of things that make me uncomfortable. For one, he won't post to his social media accounts any photos of us. He says he has no issue with people seeing that we are together but refuses to post on his personal accounts our photos. We are/WERE in a relationship on Facebook officially but people don't really use that anymore do they? Anyways let's get right down to it. I have been on my own since I was 17, I come from a pretty abusive and messed up childhood that has left me with more family issues than I'd like to admit. My mother has multiple personalities and mental health issues. I don't keep in contact with her or my stepfather for these reasons. It seems as if every time I get ahead in life they try and bring me back. I have difficulties with being vulnerable with men because of said issues so this new guy was great because he seemed to want to listen to me at some point. We have very high high's and very low low's... to the point where he calls his dad and tells him literally E V E R Y T H I N G about our arguments and includes him in it..

Fast forward to dating said boyfriend and it's made me think I might have bipolar or an anxiety disorder because of the way he tells me I'm the one whose wrong and is being abusive.. I think differently and that he's being manipulative and controlling. Everytime we get into a fight, it's extreme. I am always wrong, I explain why he is wrong for hurting my feelings or saying mean things and that I need him to listen to what I am saying but it's like he twists everything around on me and doesn't feel sorry for anything he ever says or does. One example of this would be 2 months ago I got ringworm from him. RINGWORM!!!! As a woman do you have any idea how gross and disgusted I was instantly with myself when I discovered a GIANT SCALY SPOTTED SPOT ON MY BACK?!! You know what he did? Laughed, and told me to leave his house because I was being mean when I said I felt gross. I was having an anxiety attack over it, and he was laughing. 

With COVID-19 everything in my life has been heightened with said boyfriend and I have fought a lot more, I have noticed the last month or so that he's been really touchy with his phone and won't let me look at it. Throughout the last 6 months, on two separate occasions I have gotten random messages from anonymous people saying ""Your boyfriend is cheating, you'd be stupid to think otherwise."" I have confronted boyfriend about it and he obviously denies it up and down but I don't know if I trust him. He tells me I'm acting crazy and that he trusts me why don't I trust him?? Before I made the decision to break it off, I started creeping and researching some instances with relationships on here and I think he might be a sociopath or slightly narcissistic. I've never dated ANYONE like him so I'm unsure if I am the problem or he is the one. 

A few weeks ago there was an incident that involved alcohol, he was more drunk than I and wanted to have sex. I explained that for women to get turned on it involves more than laying down to someone that is naked. He got so upset and this is where I got ANNOYED, HE PUT HIS FINGERS IN HIS EARS LIKE A CHILD AND SAID I CAN'T HEAR YOU and was ignoring me. I turned the lights on, grabbed my phone and told him ""I'm taking a video of you while drunk so you can see your actions while sober and how ridiculous they are."" Started recording and was narrating the video saying ""This is \_\_\_ and he's being an adult by putting his fingers in his ears,"" 

He then GRABBED my phone from my hands, chucked it at the wall hard enough to break it and shoved me off his bed. I fell at least a good 4-5 feet from the top of his bed. (I fell hard enough to feel pain) I laid there crying out of disbelief he just put his hands on me. And then I got up, explained he just assaulted me and hurt me and he tried saying he could call the police on me for taking the video of him AND PROCEEDED TO KICK ME OUT OF HIS HOUSE AND LOCK THE DOOR. It was 6:30am and I was also a bit intoxicated but I wouldn't say nearly the same level of drunk he was. 

A few days go by and I reach out saying we need to talk. We meet up and I'm thinking 'ok he'll apologize and realize that was waaaaay out of line.' NO. He tells me I betrayed him and he was defending himself because I was on top of him and in his face yelling at him? Like listen I am posting this to reddit because I'm desperate for an outsiders perspective on this incident. I would ADMIT to touching him or being on top of him or ANY OF THAT BS. I am far from perfect but that is not the case, the video even shows me not touching or in his face like wtf? So I leave his house angry and upset and go home, I explain that I am moving in the next two weeks an hour south of him and that since I'm such a problem in his life I will take myself out of it. He says we need distance, and space to fix our issues because there's no other solution. It's been 2 weeks since this incident, I have tried texting, calling, gaming online, reaching out to hang out and nothing. He ignores me or blows me off, it doesn't even feel like we are together. I have seen him 2 times since the incident, he hid his phone both times. The second random message came the night before I ended it with him. He hasn't apologized for the bed incident, but I have. I have tried to fix things, slow down take a step back and reignite our relationship to how great it used to be.. but he doesn't give me any attention anymore. It's like he lost interest completely, didn't want to be with me and wanted me to end things with him so he could see other women. He says ""we need distance, I don't like it but we need it to fix the arguments escalating so much. I didn't want to break up, I didn't want any of this at all but you don't listen to me. You made your choice so that's that"". I have spoken to my close friends about it and they think I 110% should have left his ass months ago. I am so embarrassed and scared to speak to others that I felt the need to post here. 

My question is... did I do the right thing? Obviously I love him and want it to work but I can't wrap my head around someone who is like this and treats me like this. 

Am I in an abusive and toxic relationship? How do I convince myself that someone I really do care for and love that I need to let go? I have dated multiple people and it seems this has been the hardest to disconnect myself completely. It's like he's twisted everything on me and refuses to admit any empathy or responsibility for his actions. If I am not right, how do I fix this? I am so depressed I can barely get out of bed. I move tomorrow morning and he hasn't reached out to see me or anything. I just feel like I am the problem and maybe I need to see a therapist. 

Please help Reddit."
"I’m confused with my thoughts and feelings about my boyfriend. I’m writing a post because I’m confused about how I feel towards my boyfriend. I used to be borderline obsessed with him, now I don’t want him around. It’s strange. I find myself wishing he would leave the house and go do something else during the day. I know for a fact that I don’t feel the same about him as I used to. But at this point I’m not sure if I’m just irritated with him or if I no longer love him anymore. Every time he comes around it instantly puts me in a bad mood. I’ve been trying to decipher how I feel about him for months now. I need to come to a conclusion before the end of the month. Do I still love him if I don’t want him around much? By this I mean, most nights I hope he is staying at his friends house and not coming home. I wish for this because I have started to value time by myself more than time with him. What do you guys think?"
"[17M] wondering how to navigate feelings of breaking up with gf [17F] So I got into my first relationship ever with a girl a few months ago, and things were going good until we made a couple mistakes. We talked about her past a bit too much and I learned some stuff that goes against some of my morals and what I thought she initially was like. While I wish we had just ignored looking into her past relationships completely, it's been done and I don't want her to be stuck in a relationship where I can't give my complete feelings to her due to myself not being comfortable with what I've learned. 

I plan on having a long conversation with her in-person after quarantine is over and I really hope we can stay friends in some way, and I just really want to avoid causing her as much emotional damage as I can.

Here's where I'm having issues: As of now I feel like I might never be able to have a relationship in the future that I can completely trust. I know one trigger for me now is not looking into past relationships and delving into that information, but I'm scared I might just always hold off on a new person in-case they have stuff hidden.

Secondly, I'm also scared that I might always wonder about the what-if of this relationship, on what-if I could have made it work or what-if she is the right one, even though I know I can't get over the insecurities surrounding what I found out. It's a feeling of what am I missing out if I end my relationship with her.

EDIT:
I feel like I almost want her to come to me and break up with me for some reason, it's just me having to end it puts the thought in my head of what if I'm making the wrong decisions, and if I might always question that."
"One of my best friends (f) thinks my husband is homophobic and tries to prove her theory I met my friend, we'll call her N, about 5 years ago. She's also a freelance in my field, but far more experienced. We started a great friendship since then, she's a party-hard extrovert, funny and great. 

I met my now husband three years ago and we're crazy in love, he's an incredible guy and always takes care of me. He moved in from his country a year before our wedding and we got married on September 2019. We have so much fun together and my family absolutely loves him. 

When I first introduced each other, N was in a very tough relationship. I don't think her girlfriend at the time was good for her and I was very honest about it. It ended pretty bad because of the constant fighting (we had to go and literally rescue her from the ex several times) and we both tried to be there for her. My husband was really only doing it because of me, he said N was a little too much for him and tended to overwhelm him.

With the wedding prep and the honeymoon, last year was pretty busy and I had to skip a couple parties and events N hosted. She introduced us her new girlfriend at my wedding, were she apparently had a great time and whatnot.

On December, her girlfriend snapped at me saying that she couldn't believe how bad we were treating N. I was shocked so I decided to talk to N about it and she said she was mad because I didn't come to her parties, I wasn't spending that much time with her anymore and that my husband's jokes were rude. I apologized for all of the things I was doing wrong but when asking about my husband's attitude to her she said that he was just rude in his responses and didn't like the jokes he made. She highlighted that he only did those jokes when she was with her girlfriend and, therefore, they felt attacked, she thought it was related to her sexuality. I asked if he said something explicitly rude or called them names and she said it was the humor he had. 

Now, my husband loves to make jokes. He loves to tease people and everyone has a good laugh when he's around. He never crosses some lines, though. I told him about it and he promised not to do any jokes when N was around.

It seemed like all was good, but yesterday a friend sent me the number for a women's organization that ""could help me"". Apparently, N was spreading the rumour *among our work colleagues* that my husband was homophobic and verbally abusive.
I talked to N and she's sure he's a terrible person and told me she won't stop until he's gone. I tried explaining but she won't quit and says I'm blinded.

Am I missing something? Should I try and talk to her? My husband doesn't know she's saying that, should I just tell him? Help."

"I (31M) need serious help choosing which of two dates (27F) and (24F) to make it official with Hello,

Super appreciative of the RA community here and the ability to receive honest and helpful feedback! 

I’m going to go straight into it and talk about a relationship problem that I am currently facing. 

I am currently dating two girls, of which I am both interested in. After a few months of dating, I feel like I seriously need to make a choice and advance with one of them by asking them to be my girlfriend, while calling it quits with the other.

Trouble is, I’m truly torn between the two and cannot decide. It’s getting to the point where it’s bringing me quite a bit of anxiety – because I don’t like the feeling of getting closer with two girls at the same time without either of them knowing about each other. 

I am finding it very hard to make a choice at this current point in time. Simply put, they both have truly excellent qualities – I am completely aware that I am in a very fortunate  and lucky position. Here is the summary of pros and cons for both women. Please keep in mind that I’m currently 31 and am currently looking to date for marriage – whoever I end up advancing with, I will definitely be looking to keep going with marriage being the end goal in sight.  

The first girl - Amanda:
Pros: This girl is an absolute angel of a girl. She is very nurturing, very witty, funny and she just has a heart made of gold. She’s the type that wouldn’t hurt a fly. She’s very sensitive towards other people’s emotions and feelings, and she has a very strong aura of warmth, love and care. In short, the reason why I am so attracted to this girl is because I know hands down that she would be an absolutely amazing wife and probably an even better mother. She’s extraordinarily patient, and is just overall a very nurturing person. She’s someone who gives off amazing vibes of niceness, that you just simply feel good by being around her. 

Cons:
She has huge issues with life motivation, career and ambition. She is currently working on her master’s degree for a very extended period of time (her graduation has been extended by over two years as she cannot find the motivation to finish off her thesis) on a part-time basis, while refusing to look for any work in the meantime – a lot of idle time on her hands. She once found an office job and quit on the third day because she found the full-time nature of the job too stressful.  She’s 27 and I believe she is still using her parents’ money. She’s actually not sure at all as to what job she wants to find and does not have any much drive to make money, or at least secure a financial future. I am pretty certain that if I proceeded with this girl, I would definitely become the breadwinner/perhaps the sole provider by default, which would mean there would be a lot of financial pressure on my shoulders. We live in one of the world’s most expensive cities where most of the time even two incomes in a household doesn’t guarantee financial security.  I think with children in the picture in the future, I just don’t see how we could make it work financially without an incredible amount of pressure/stress/my financial goals being thrown out the window. I’m a secondary school math teacher so my salary is not incredible – I really don’t want to have to try and raise a family on mostly my salary alone – as I’m not a high-income earner, I think I really may need a partner to work with me in order to reach our financial goals and provide for our family together.  My family shares the same concerns as I do. 

The second girl - Christine: 
Pros: This girl is one of a kind – a girl who would be extremely difficult to replace. She’s bouncy, energetic, unbelievably passionate, and really smart. She is able to hold wonderfully intellectual conversations that are wonderfully stimulating. She’s passionate about a lot of the things I’m passionate about – math/finance, books, healthy living, we even like the same tv shows - which means we honestly never run out of things to bond over. She’s also just a heap of fun to be around with – she is hilarious and we both get each other’s sense of humor. She cheers me up because we just end up laughing most of the time we spend together.  Added to the fact that she’s incredibly intelligent, there really is never a boring moment. Career wise – she is working in an interesting and niche field of finance and is extremely passionate in what she does. I am sure that she will end up being very well paid given her career trajectory (she’s currently 24) and will have a lot of financial security, which means that she doesn’t have any of the issues previously stated regarding Amanda.  

Cons: 
Sometimes, I feel like she is a very ‘intense’ person. I’m actually also a high-energy person like she is, but sometimes I feel like she’s just truly bursting at the seams and there are times where I can’t fully really zone out and chill at certain times. However, this doesn’t happen often and isn’t that really that big of a problem. She also is a huge social butterfly and is kind of the life of the party. I’m not exactly an introvert, but I do feel a little bit timid around her at times. Sometimes, she’ll poke fun at me (in a harmless way), but it does definitely make me feel self-conscious. Also, she has a very competitive personality – so whatever subject we talk about, she will always want to prove that she’s in the right, that she knows more, that she’s smarter…. Etc. This does get very tiring after a while as I feel like (to use a sports analogy) she’s playing for the opposite team and trying to get a goal past me rather than letting us pass the ball to each other and cheer each other on. 


Overall, I feel like my heart is telling me to go for Amanda, but my logical, fun and adventurous side is asking me to for Christine. Honestly, looking at the long term, I feel like Amanda would take care of my emotional and physical health very well. She’s just that nurturing, caring and attentive. However, I’m really finding this decision a little difficult because I feel like it would be very tough on me to be the main and only provider of the family, for reasons stated above. Christine, on the other hand, would be a great long term companion – she has so many great traits about her that she’s almost even like a personal role model – I actually genuinely look up to her and would love to be more like her. However, Christine doesn’t really capture my heart as well as Amanda does for some reason. At the end of the day, my intuition is leaning more towards Amanda – however I just feel that the con she has is actually kind of a dealbreaker.

Thanks so much for reading, and thanks so much for your helpful comments, advice suggestions in advance. Much appreciated – hope you have a wonderful day!

EDIT: Thanks all for your immediate feedback on the fact that I shouldn't be dating two girls for a few months. I've reflected on what you all have said and want to make it clear that 'dating' is probably not the word I should have used. The way it truly is is that we have been getting to know each other over the majority of the time as friends via text message as we were not living in the same city from Feb to beginning of April. I have permanently relocated back my to hometown at the start of April due to the virus, which means that me and the two girls concerned could actually start to each other face to face and get to know each other. Naturally, this allowed me to reach the point where I am today. Hopefully puts some backdrop on the situation. In the end, I really am looking for some genuine advice on this matter - I don't want this to turn into a hounding on me on how messed up the notion dating more than one girl for a few months is - I completely agree with what you are all saying and believe me, my intention is never to hurt anybody. Thanks again for all comments and suggestions."
"Younger sister got dumped, how do i talk to her? My youngest sister (17) just experienced her first heartbreak and won't speak to anyone. How do I help her out of this? I'm just a guy and don't know what to say/do except do what any loving crazy brother would do - scare the sh*t out of him"
"Should I (21F) tell my stepdad's (42?M) new girlfriend (40sF) that he's a douchebag? So my mom left her ex husband recently. He's started dating a new woman with two kids. He has hit my sisters and Mom and I occasionally, and is just really mean and awful. He yells constantly and is just really emotionally and verbally abusive. I'm not in contact with him at all anymore but have been considering warning the woman he started dating of how he is, but he would make my sisters' and mom's life really difficult. I really don't know what to do, and I think regardless of how I act it's going to negatively affect some people. Any advice for what I should do and how to go about telling this woman if that's what I decide to do?"
"sexually assaulted, kicked out because roommate didn’t believe me 
Going to try to make this is as streamlined as possible. My best friend Rebekah (24F) has a sister a few years younger than us Carly (21F). In September of 2018 I had left an abusive relationship and was crashing on Rebekah’s couch until January of 2019, which is when I moved into Carly’s house because she had an extra room and had spent a few months trying to convince me to move in. Now it’s April—Rebekah, Carly and I start hanging out with a group of guys that we met at a local music festival. Long story short—in May, one of those guys asked to come over for advice and to vent about his relationship problems. Having gone through a breakup recently, I had no problem allowing him over while Carly wasn’t home because I considered him a new friend and figured he could use advice or just someone to listen. I

 suspected nothing. He ends up sexually assaulting me. It takes me a few days to put the pieces together, and as soon as I do I call Carly and tell her what happened. I was scared and panicking and couldn’t really believe what happened. She pretended to believe me until we got off the phone, which is when she drove to her dad’s house and told them everything I had told her in confidence. She was advised by her step-mom that because it wasn’t a violent encounter and because I used the words “we shouldn’t do this, stop” repeatedly instead of managing to say “no”, it wasn’t assault and my story was now shady in her eyes. It doesn’t help that Carly had a “crush” on the perpetrator, and was now convinced that I had covered up  consensual sex with a story so she wouldn’t get mad. 

She later went to hang out with the rapist, and asked him for his side of the story. From what I hear he told her essentially the same story and apparently even admitted that he “crossed lines”. 

In September, she gave me a less than 30 day notice to pack my things and move out of her house. She chose to choose the side of the guy who had assaulted me, who she had known for less than 6 months, instead of me, her friend, who she had known for years. Okay. It’s shitty. Extremely shitty. But I move out and move on. 

Now, in May of 2020, my best friend Rebekah and I move into a place together. Yesterday her dad and step mom stop by, and I sense some hesitation around me. They aren’t as welcoming and nice as they used to be. I ask Rebekah if her parents have an issue with me, and she admits that they do. Her step-mom doesn’t believe I was assaulted and that I can’t be trusted. I ask why her dad doesn’t like me and she tells me that Carly has told them a slew of untrue statements about me, including the fact that I apparently never paid rent on time. I pulled up my Venmo statements to prove that I not only paid on time, but early every single month. Although, I’m not sure why late rent payments would cause a father to hate his daughter’s friend, which leads me to believe there is so much being spread about me that I don’t know. 

I was never best friends with Carly but definitely considered us to be close and someone I could confide in. She was the first person I told after I realized what had happened that night. I’m the type of person who likes everyone until I’m given a reason not to. I’m not very outgoing, but I’m kind to everyone I meet, I try to help others when they need it, and I pretty much keep to myself and mind my own business. I could never fathom doing what Carly did to me. I just don’t get it. I’ve done nothing to her to make her hate me, but she continues to try and taint my reputation among our common circle of people and it hurts. I was already dealing with guilt about my assault, asking myself why I didn’t push him off, why I didn’t try harder to make him stop, why I froze and couldn’t speak or move or react...having someone who I thought was a friend tell you that even though you and your perpetrator’s stories match, you should have “tried harder if you didn’t want it”, absolutely crushes me. It has me questioning reality...did this even happen? Am I unknowingly spreading lies? Am I crying assault when it’s just regret? I would never purposefully lie about something as serious as this. She even knows that according to perpetrator’s roommate, he asked if he could “have his shot” about me before coming over, and had kissed Rebekah while she was asleep on the couch a few weeks prior. 

Now I’m wondering what to do in terms of living with Rebekah. Rebekah is my best friend, but Carly is still her sister, and seeing her at times will be unavoidable. Carly thinks we’re on good terms. I wonder if would be beneficial to my mental health to block her on all social media, not out of spite but just to be more selective about who can see my posts and to avoid seeing hers, and every time I see her name I think about how she treated me and put me through. Their parents will also be around on occasion, and I don’t know what to do. It feels awful having done nothing wrong but not being liked anyway. I don’t have the energy to “win them back” so to speak, but I’m paying the same amount of rent and I don’t want to feel like I have to hide in my room every time one of them comes over. I just feel embarrassed that my own story was taken from me and spread by Carly without permission, that I’m hated by people that don’t know my character, and I wonder how many other people she’s associated with think I’m this terrible person. Just don’t know what to do and can’t stop thinking about it."
"Socially distanced Mother’s Day There’s a lot to unpack here but I’ll try to keep it brief. 

My (f23) sister, we’ll call her Mary, convinced me to drive and visit my parents (m50, f47) this Mother’s Day. Currently, my boyfriend and I live in a more densely populated area than them and we are remaining careful when we are in public with the virus. Our city has high case rates and deaths and we don’t want to be spreaders. 

Last weekend, we visited some land my boyfriend’s family recently bought to help with yard work and we had a cookout, all while maintaining physical distance as his sister has a compromised immune system. We brought our own food, utinsils and even tools and we wore masks. It was hard to not physically be near them and it was a bit odd, but we knew it was for the best and it was good to see them and talk to them while helping out. Everyone was in agreement that it was hard but necessary. 

This weekend is posing some different challenges. We had intentions to do generally the same thing with my family, as we did with my boyfriends. With stay at home orders and my alcoholic father, my mom has sunken very deep into depression. My other sister, we’ll call her Haley, also has underlying health conditions (stemming from a congenital heart defect) along with other physical and mental disabilities and needs somebody at home with her at all times. My father comes and goes as he pleases and spends a lot of time drinking with a friend in the large storage garage on their property. This leaves my mom to stay with Haley all the time. While my parents say they’re being careful, with my boyfriend and I coming from a high virus case area, we don’t want to take any risks with Haley. 

My mother has expressed to my aunt (we’ll call her Nancy) that she does not want to distance from us and that because I grew up in the house I shouldn’t have to distance from her. Nancy says my mom feels very alone and isolated, and I don’t blame her. But Nancy told me “you guys don’t go anywhere, just hug your mom and spend time with her and don’t distance from her.” My mom generally gives into the mental health stigmas so it’s not an open or easy topic to discuss. Nancy also told me that she just needs love and compassion and she’ll bounce back a little bit, but gladly convinced my mom that she needed to get some professional help. 

I know the simple solution would be “just don’t go” but there has already been an arguement between Mary and I about me not visiting home and my parents telling her that I don’t visit either. Majority of the decision to visit was done in guilt, but that’s an issue I’ll talk to my therapist about when I’m able. 

My question is: how do I remain sensitive about my mothers depression, considering my fathers alcoholism and my sister’s (Haley) health conditions, while feeling strongly about distancing? 


TLDR: visiting my parents for Mother’s Day. My mom doesn’t want me to physically distance because she’s extremely depressed and lonely but my boyfriend and I are being very careful as virus cases are high where we live and my sister has underlying health conditions."
"Someone I hooked up with lied about being single. I’m a male, mid 20s. She’s a female, late 20s.

Before all this quarantine stuff happened, I met her on Tinder. Conversation went well, we went on a date a couple days later, and hooked up. This happened about 5 or 6 times, every time it was spur of the moment and it always seemed like she had a very busy life outside of us hooking up. I also keep busy so I didn’t think much of it. 

We hadn’t talked for a while, the last meetup was about a week before the stay-at-home order began in our state. She snapped me 3 days ago and we’ve been talking. It’s gotten sexual, but we both agreed it’s better not to meet up. 

I hadn’t logged into Facebook in ages, but quarantine has left me so bored that I decided to open it up. I then had the bright idea of looking her up. She hasn’t posted in months, her profile is pretty much dead other than happy birthday wishes. But I did find one huge thing out... She’s married. She got married 4 years ago. I looked up the husband and he last posted about a week ago, a picture of them two together, so they are very much still together.

I asked a friend of mine and she thinks I should message the husband and let him know. That feels like the right thing to do, but I’m not sure, so I came here. Any advice is appreciated"
"Can she be taking advantage of me? Iv been with my girlfriend 7 years. Her and my son moved up to Oregon in December. I stayed for work and plan on going up there in july to be with them. Im sending her 600 a month to help out with my son.  She questions me if im actually gonna go up there which i am. I want to be with my family, i miss them so much..but im starting to feel like she isnt meaning it when she says she misses me. Im starting to feel like she is hoping i change my mind about going and just saying that she missed me and wants me to come so she doesnt sound like the bad guy. A good majority of the time ill send her a sweet text she doesnt respond till hours later(she could be busy and i understand that) but will completly blow off what i said with something completly different. Kinda same with my calls. Ill call her and she doesnt answer (no big deal) but when ill try a few hours later she will answer and say she didnt know i called her. I dunno if  im just sitting in my thought to much or what."
"My boyfriend (41) has children from a previous marriage &amp; has said he doesn’t see himself having any more children. How do I (28f no kids) come to terms with this? Sorry if there is formatting issues, I’m writing this on my phone. 

So essentially with all of the free time quarantine has provided us, we have been having some hard conversations. He is 41 and has 2 children (8 &amp; 10)  from a previous marriage - amicable divorce, everyone thankfully gets along! We were talking the other day about our future together - we have been together nearly 3 years. The age gap hasn’t been an issue, until the subject of more children came up. 

He essentially stated that he didn’t want to be in his 50’s running around after toddlers which I also 100% understand but I have always been very open about the fact that I would like to have children one day and I feel a bit blindsided by this. He is my best friend, I adore everything about him, but am I sacrificing too much if I decide to stay with him and have no children? I don’t want to end up resenting him when it’s not his fault. But I’m just devastated, he asked me if it was a deal breaker and I don’t know how to answer that? Is there any way past this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR; My boyfriend (41) already has children and doesn’t want anymore, I (28f) have always seen myself having a big family, can I move past this without resenting him?"
"My (F24) long distance on again off again partner (M26) continually ignores me when we have problems To start off with, I wasn’t entirely sure to post here or AITA, but it’s about a relationship so I thought here would be best. Me and this partner, we’ll call him M met three years ago when he was living in my city on a working visa as he is not from my country. 

We go through a cycle. We’ve reconnected now three times over the last three years and each time the same thing happens. Everything starts off amazing. We talk/video chat every day and then something will happen and he will just ignore me all of a sudden. 

This last time was different. He was dating someone else and so was I. So we agreed that we would try to be more casual, which meant when he began ignoring me again and I got upset I apologised for getting upset because he didn’t really owe me anything. 

However, he continued to downplay the situation and I realised that this is the way he acts each time. I’m made to minimise my feelings and he just ignores them until they go away. It’s made me extremely upset and confused and angry. I’m not really sure where to go from here...

Edit: I’m new here so I don’t really know how things work yet. But I want to say thank you to those of you who have replied so far. The reassurance that the relationship isn’t the right one and obviously our communication is terrible is just the support I need to end things permanently! Thank you so much."
"I (M23) am finding it hard to know what to do about my ex/ childhood sweetheart (F23) now that I understand my emotions First thing first thank you for reading all this and providing input. Fitting over a decade in a few words is tough but the full story is complicated. I was not the cream of the crop growing up. As a kid I was chubby, shy, goofy, bullied for being so. In 6th grade I met the most lovely, smart, and kind girl I have ever met, even up to this point in my life. Lets call her Alice. Alice instantly became one of my best friends. We passed notes in class then tried to be in a relationship around 8th. As a shy kid I was a terrible boyfriend and when we graduated and went to separate high schools things fizzled off but I still really loved her. Sophomore year we pick things up again long distance and that really didn’t work out either but we broke up very nicely again and she was still my best friend. It’s around this time I see her really start to develop her physical beauty. Its like what I saw inside finally came out. I was lucky enough to have her be my date at prom and I was hers also. 

For me a big change came at the end of high school and beginning of college also. I grew past 6ft, focused on athletics, lost 70lbs and discovered a jawline under the cheeks. Needless to say going from a bullied kid to that really affected my ego in a bad way. I was getting attention now and started to act like a D bag honestly. It’s at this point I date Alice’s best friend even though I still really loved Alice. Alice pretended to be fine with it but later admitted she wasn’t. Long story short that ends after 3 months. From that point on I date more and live a “young” person party life. But I still really miss Alice and she is still one of my best friends. 

Despite everything Alice decides to give us a real shot this time. Boy were those some of the best times of my life. I fell deeply in love,was loyal, and would do anything for her. But... I still had that d-bag mentality in me. After 2 years those thoughts grew. I wanted to let loose, now that I was 21 I could go to vegas or clubs. Those thoughts really pushed me away from alice. i started to be more sensitive to things she did that I didn’t like. I would think about breaking up with her so I could be free to do all those things I wanted. The thoughts that maybe she wasn’t good enough came along. I didn’t feel happy. So I snapped one day and got really upset with her over text for going to a club in vegas with her cousin while she was on vacation with her family. it’s something I always wanted to do. she had given me no warning about it and did not text me that whole night. When she finally did she was apologetic but still I persisted. 

I questioned her loyalty and asked if she was with any guys. I knew she would never but still that thought was said outloud. It was in that moment she broke down telling me I was more worried about her loyalty when she didn’t text me than her safety. It was in that moment I really hated the person I was becoming. I could tell she was tired of me always causing drama and arguments. I knew in that moment I tainted my image. I knew she wanted things to be over at that point. So we agreed to meet up once she got back from Vegas. It was sweet, we told each other how much we loved each other and I proposed ending the relationship and she agreed. I told her I needed to focus on managing my emotions and figuring out what I want and asked her for another chance potentially in the future. She said she wouldn’t know how she would feel but she would consider. We have some lunch after, gave each other a long hug and a final kiss and that was the last time I saw her. 

It’s been about 11 months now. I traveled allot the first 7 months. I wanted to live the life I was curious about when I was still with Alice. Went to Vegas like I wanted, had flings and dated. I felt so terrible doing all that. Nothing was worth it. Alice never left my mind. I sent her a single message about 5 months after it ended asking how things were, nothing more nothing less... no response. I sunk pretty low. Smoked and drunk more than I ever have. I felt miserable and that’s when I remembered that I promised Alice I would work on myself, so that’s what I did. I read helpful books, cleaned my space, and started to meditate and observe my emotions. After 5 months I feel like I have a handle on why I thought the things I did. I realize now that I’m responsible for my own happiness and no partying or one person can define my happiness . I put all that pressure on Alice and it was wrong. 

Fast forward to now. I hope this will be where you can help me out. While I know getting back together with Alice or talking to Alice wont shape the reality of my happiness, boy do I miss her. Not the stressful relationship I made but just her. She has been a miracle in my life and has taught me so much about myself for so long. She is the person I could see myself loving and enjoying their company for the rest of my life. I didn’t think I could be that for someone until now. I know I can be a good partner now. I know whoever I spend the rest of my life with I will try to be the best I can be for myself and for my partner. But the simple fact is Alice has not tried communicating with me. If she’s happy not talking to me or being with me all I want is her happiness. It boils down to this. Should I try contacting Alice? I simply don’t want it to be selfish if I’ve already wasted her time this long. I understand her not trusting her time to me again. I still work actively to understand and logically think about my emotions. Although I know I’m responsible for my own happiness it would not be easy to be rejected. But this hope of a potential with Alice, while it motivated me to keep going, I no longer want to be my motivation. Should I let her go, no longer put a potential on Alice, and be the man I wanted to be for the next one ? or try talking to her?"
"My (20F) best friend (20F) only listens to her boyfriend (20M). I have known my friend for 6 years, and she's been dating her boyfriend for 2 of them.

She's a very stubborn person who's unwilling to hear other people's point of view...EXCEPT for her boyfriend's. She automatically believes whatever he says.

Examples:

1. She had an iPhone for years and loved it. Her boyfriend says ""Android's are better"" and she bought a new phone and constantly hates on my phone because it's an iPhone. He didn't even have to convince her, she just believes whatever he says. This goes for bigger issues too.
2. She used to think it's disgusting for girls to masturbate. I tried to convince her for a week it's normal, but she wouldn't hear it and called me gross. Her boyfriend says ""it's normal"" and she automatically sides with him saying ""you're right baby, I think it's more common than I thought""
3. She was arguing with 2 of her friends once and her boyfriend said to cut them out and she did. They used the excuse that her 2 friends were toxic, when in reality, they were anything but toxic and were just trying to get her to see their point of view on how she was treating them.

&amp;#x200B;

It's becoming a bit annoying how she immediately sides with him. How do I get her to listen to MY point of view? She does the same thing with our friends, unwilling to hear other people's side of an argument or disagreement.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - My best friend listens to her boyfriend when it comes to anything, but she refuses to hear friends out. I tried telling her this, but as the problem implies, she doesn't want to hear me out. How do I go about this?"
"Should I (30F) tell my husband (32M) that I don’t want to have kids because of him? I’ve always been on the fence about having kids, leaning more on the no side. My husband grew up thinking it was something that would happen but after talking about the realities of what having a child is like, he is also on the fence but leaning more toward the yes side. 

As it stands now, we’re agreed on not having children but every once in a while it’s brought up and I’m wondering if I should tell him the biggest thing stopping me is his behavior?

He would not be a good example for a child. He leaves dishes and clothes all around the house. His only chores are cleaning the litter box and taking out the trash and I always have to nag him to get them done even after I’ve helped him set alarms to remind him. He enjoys cooking but I’m starting to dread that as well because he always leaves the kitchen upside down. He loves to spend time with friends and often loses track of time and doesn’t get home until very late. I take care of paying the majority of our bills and am the person who contacts the banks, insurance companies, etc. 

On our days off he always wakes up before me and I have the hope that this is going to be the day that on his own he’ll see the mess or house project and tackle it but it never seems to happen. I feel like I always have to be the responsible one to bring up the things that need to be done. I’ve been asking since the covid situation happened for us to take a bike ride and he’s always shot me down so he’s even against fun things that take effort. 

These things suck but he has good behaviors that offset them but with a child involved I don’t think I could be as tolerant. 

I’m sure he would step up especially if I asked him to do certain tasks but I feel like so much would fall on me. Without me prompting him I can’t imagine him contributing to keeping up the house, proving healthy meals, doctor’s appointment, or financially. I do see him being a good friend and spending time playing with the child although I could also see him just sticking it in front of the TV and considering that play time.  

I think another thing influencing me is that I had an amazing father who was a great role model so my standards are pretty high. 

I guess my question is what good would it be to bring these things up? I feel like one of 3 could happen:

This opens his eyes and he does change his behavior to be a good role model

He changes nothing and we do not have a child but I’ve now hurt him

He changes temporarily but once the child comes he goes back to his old ways"
"Brother needing too much attention from my boyfriend during quarantine. What do I do? So since quarantine I've(19F) been staying with my boyfriend(23). He lives with his parents and his brother(28). Its just a lot better staying here with more company and things to do rather than my room at a relatives that's in a basement with no natural lighting. (Boring and depressing) however the main issues arise here with my boyfriend's brother. His brother is clearly worked up in the quarantine, bored out of his mind. And that means he always wants to do something, go out and take a drive, play games, get food out somewhere, anything. But it gets to be much sometimes and my boyfriend doesnt always want to do things with him, he likes doing things on his own a lot too. But his brother is super pushy to get him to hang out with him, he'll find any reason and excuse to why he should hang out with him, that HE'S the one being a bother not hanging out with him. Like it's my boyfriends job to keep him sane and not bored. He wants to be included in everything. But romantic relationships are so much different than sibling relationships. We wanna have things to do just on our own too. Not too long ago the brother got really upset about something, like he felt like he was being excluded. Now, my boyfriend isnt the greatest on communication, which can sometimes lead to others feeling hurt or thinking something differently. But overall it feels like we try to include him on a lot, try to make him not so bored. When my boyfriends communication doesnt go right I try to fill in to make his brother feel better and not feel ignored. But still apparently it's not enough. After the brother got really upset my boyfriend went in to talk to him. And I could hear it from the other room and it was just awful how stubborn and pushy his brother was being, yelling too. Just all excuses and reasons again, being upset that it doesnt feel like my boyfriend wants to hang out with him, that they're family, he needs to be there for him etc. Everytime my boyfriend would try to say something reasonable he would talk over and deny it. I could hear the frustration in my boyfriend, I dont know how he put up with it. And while the brother won't say it directly, I know he blames me. He would say things like "" ever since she's been in your life you dont hang out with me as much"" and he says things like ""I get it, shes your girlfriend.. but still"" trying to soften the blow. Hes only said something along those lines to my boyfriend a few times that I've heard, but I know hes holding back on how he feels about me. Hes always really nice to me, and I to him. But sometimes I feel like it's just a coverup.. I mean it makes sense in his mind to blame me and be upset. He wants to hang out with my boyfriend, but well girlfriend is over now. And if boyfriend doesnt wanna hang out, it must be the girlfriend that's saying ""no! Dont leave, stay here and hang out with me!"" But in reality he really just doesnt wanna hang out.. hes usually just doing his own thing and I'm doing my own thing. Sometimes I would even tell him to just go hang out with him so he's not sad. It's honestly just been a big stressor. I just wanna enjoy staying with my boyfriend and live life but everyday I also have to think about what his brother is gonna say. I understand the stress of being in quarantine and being bored and lonely. But that doesnt mean you need to steal someones attention by force all the time. If someone doesnt wanna hang out, accept it and find something else to do. His brother really feels a best friend kind of relationship with my boyfriend, but my boyfriend has told him he just doesnt feel the same. But he just won't accept that response. I've been feeling more and more off lately by the brothers feelings, I can just tell with everything he says hes mad that I'm here, wants me gone to have my boyfriend all to himself. He's clearly jealous. I just dont know what to do about it. I've been thinking to just have a one to one talk with him to clear the air and have things be okay between us. But it just feels awkward. And he's like 10 years older than me.  I dont know how to go about this, or if I should just let it be. What should I do?"
"I [22F] need help keeping distance from him [30M] and his toxic tendencies. How can I keep him away? I'm in a casual relationship with my toxic partner and have been on and off with him for the past 1.5 years. I'm in a casual relationship mainly because I dont want the expectations that comes with having a boyfriend, but despite the nature of our relationship he doesnt respect me and constantly talks to other women. He trespasses over my boundaries, keeps things from me, and runs off to other people which is disrespectful to my values of honesty and trust. All while expecting me to not have any intimate relations with anyone else or else he would get upset. 

I've left him multiple times but he keeps coming back to me and idk what to do. I've tried to be civil and expressed how I  have no desire in wanting to continue the casual relationship with him anymore. I try to end things on good terms and hope that the decision is mutual, but he keeps coming back?"
"I'm (36M) not sure if I should tell my wife (41F) I want a divorce or not? TL;DR at the end.

I've been married for about 15 years. We've always had different outlooks on things like where to live, if we should have kids or not, etc. This was ok while things were still new; After all, we were still young and trying to figure things out. A few years into the marriage I realized that what I wanted was changing and didn't really mesh very well with my wife's wants. I would just grin and bear it and tell myself, ""marriage is about compromise and none of the things I'm compromising on are really *that* important."" This went on for years until slowly my opinion, wants, and needs really didn't matter anymore. She would listen when I would express a desire for something different, give me the lip service of ""sure we can do/not do that"", and then proceed to completely ignore me. Example: I had come to really really dislike not only the city we lived in, but the whole region (still do). She kept telling me over and over that she would look for a job to transfer, but that's been 8 years ago now. Right around this same time I was expressing a desire to move, entered player 3. We'll call her Jane. Jane and I both got promotions at the same time and started a new job for the company we worked for. We worked closely together, and became very close personally. Jane was very pretty, very bubbly, and pretty flirty with everyone. She's one of those girls that literally everyone falls for. It wasn't long before it was obvious we both wished there could be more to the relationship. She knew I was married; I had made it a point to tell her so. We continued to get close, but always with the understanding that nothing could happen between us because I was married. This was something that we expressly talked about. Even with that precaution in place, gossip happens, and word got back to my wife through mutual friends that there was some hanky panky going on. There wasn't, but it caused a **huge** rift and almost a divorce. We went to therapy for about a year, and I changed jobs. Everything was fine again by her standards, and we got back to our normal of doing what she wants and ignoring me. I had just given up by now and figured I'm just along for the ride. I had always been on the fence about wanting kids, but was leaning towards not when all the Jane stuff happened. I'm guessing my wife thought a child would help fix the marriage (even though everyone knows it never does). She politely listened to me tell her I didn't think having kids was the right thing to do, then said something to the effect of, ""that's nice, let's have a kid."" A few years later, we now have a young child. I hadn't spoken to Jane for quite a few years after the original fallout, but she has recently come back into the picture. Due to pure chance, I have to speak to her on the phone and deal with her directly quite a bit in my current job role. You can imagine where this is going I'm sure. Our feelings for each other quickly came back with a vengeance. Even more so than before. All I want is to be with her and to run away, but I know how much grief that would cause. Not only to my wife, but also my child, my family, and my in-laws. I'm really torn on what to do. Should I tell my wife I want a divorce and deal with all the fallout so I can be with the woman I love, or should I stay in a mostly loveless marriage for the sake of the child and our families?

TL;DR: been married 15 years but we've grown apart and I'm not in love anymore. I'm in love with someone else but not sure if I should blow everything up to be with her."
"How do you decide which battles to pick? So I’ve been with my boyfriend for now going on 5 months and things have definitely taken a quick pace. I adore him and I know he does me, sometimes I just feel like things moved really quickly. We exchange “I love you”s and talk about getting married once I finish school. Everything’s been fine and dandy until I went home and left the area he’s at because of COVID causing campus to shut down. I’m now 1,000 miles away and we’ve definitely been on the rocks. 

He’s always felt like my best friend, but it definitely has been different now that our relationship is based off Skype, text, and Snapchat. We’re talking a lot more and I know there’s been a lot of stressors on our relationship the last two months I’ve been gone. (Ex: I went through a miscarriage a month ago, we’re experiencing long distance for the first time, school is being an absolute pain for me, parents don’t approve of him) 

But sometimes, it seems like we’ll be talking for a while and then he’ll say something that just rubs me the wrong way. I feel comfortable talking to him about things that bother me, so I’ll bring it up and say “hey, I felt disrespected” or “hey I didn’t really like that” and it’ll turn into this tense discussion and then I get frustrated because he gets dismissive when I talk about my feelings sometimes and we didn’t really resolve it, so I want some space to think and calm down, but that’s not how he likes to do things, so he keeps pushing and pushing and I get frustrated, someone ends up hurt, then usually him or myself ends up apologizing. Rinse and repeat. 

I just hate that we bicker. And retrospectively, it’s always over something so stupid and I don’t like that. So should I just be letting things go that kinda bother me? I’ve heard the term “pick your battles” and I hate the dreadful feeling that we’re damaging our relationship every time it happens and I don’t know how to handle it properly. How do you choose what to push for when, in the moment, it always feels so important?"
"Hi, anyone out there right now. I’m about to call my brother (19M) and encourage him to get therapy after a concerning call with my mom My brother has had issues a while. Mainly depression and ADHD, so I’m always concerned. My mother is too and they live together. Lately he has been aggressive (slamming doors, throwing stuff etc). My mom is at the point of flat kicking him out once he has enough money. She’s a great mom and has been urging him to get help, but as soon as any little thing prevents that he stops. He’s sensitive and pushes people away when he feels “smothered” or told what to do. Our childhood wasn’t the best but I can say my mom did all she could. I just want to know somewhat the right things to say to get him to listen and get help EVEN if something prevents it. He usually listens to me but this time is different. I feel like if he doesn’t do it now he’ll never do it and end up ruining his life when he’s out of the nest. He also smokes pot and my mom doesn’t know. I don’t think it’s helping."
"(nsfw) how do i (21m) respond to a nude? she sent me an a dream that she had that involved us kissing at a party, and then i left for a while in the dream, and she said she was sad when i left, but the dream was overall really sweet for her. i was kissing her cheek then her neck and she said she was giggling, and she said all of this after i sent her some pretty vivid imagery myself. 

i didn’t respond because she said we were moving too fast so i’m just giving her space, but she sent me a picture of her ass*ole and i didn’t respond yet. she then hit me up again to say “hi”, but i have yet to respond to that as well. 

i dont know what to do in this situation, it seemed like days ago i was way too gooey and came off as desperate and insecure. i don’t want to be that guy anymore. 

i was thinking of saying something sexual and dominant, but idk if i can pull off saying some shit like that. i don’t wanna be cringe either, i wanna come off as cool and non desperate. i was thinking of “that tiny hole under that big fat ass” or something crazy and dumb. i don’t wanna try too hard. maybe something just like “damn, i wanna fuck you.” idk bros and hoes and non-binary folks. i know i probably sound like a douche, but i need advice

sorry if i come off as a little r/ihavesex, i know how this sounds, but i actually don’t have that much luck dating, and i really care about this girl and have a lot of feelings for her, but it seemed like she got cold feet because she was talking about kids and stuff, and i cried like a little baby (not in front of her) when she said that she wanted to take some steps back. we never said we wanted a relationship, but as soon as it got super intense it seemed like we were so solid. i love her, i seriously do. but i cannot allow myself to get like that, i have a serious alcohol problem and problems with addiction and depression. we are both gemini’s (i know). 

i still haven’t responded

tldr: girl i really like sent me an explicit picture and i don’t want to come off as needy and some horndog

EDIT : UPDATE 


[UPDATE] (nsfw) how do i (21m) respond to a nude?


so i’m just writing this now because i, a nervous guy who is figuring all this kinda stuff out (pitch for shitty sitcom) finally acted after several hours of indecision. 

so basically you know, she sent me a romantic dream, then sends me a picture of her butthole, and then she hits me up and says hi because i didn’t respond. but usually before i would’ve responded all gooey and doughey and stuff. we were basically really intensely e-dating (haha), and i got some really good advice to remain aloof and nonchalant and stuff, which i thought was good because she was hitting me up. she even called me at about 4 pm yesterday, i didn’t answer. i then sent the text, after hours of meticulous deliberation. 
the grand result was “hey sorry i’ve been a little busy, nice asshole though lmao how are you”
which prompted the response of exactly “nice”. 
this morning i sent her a funny video from twitter and referenced an inside joke that we had that made me chuckle, and it made me miss her so much. i stayed up with her at night when she was having irrational fears about aliens, love making her laugh, we watched movies together while sending voice messages and teasing each other, the shit we’d say to each other cut me so deep because i felt like she understood me on some crazy soul tie level shit. i honest to god love her. but i refuse to be #2 if she’s my #1. i’m not, but i dont feel like it sometimes. 

i have all these deep feelings for her, but i felt like i was simping before, and i absolutely cannot feel that type of way anymore because it’s very damaging to my mental health (i have a pretty bad alcohol problem/depression)

before these texts, she basically said that she needed to take some steps back because we were moving too fast and it felt like a relationship, and it destroyed me because i was ready to go all in. but yeah, the last post goes over that and i’m rambling, i honestly just have a lot of feelings for her. we know we’re number one in each other’s hearts forever, but there just seems to be maybe a power struggle rn. she tweets some pretty promiscuous stuff (shirts where her nipples are showing, quirky photos of her legs up) and i know she just likes attention and stuff, but maybe this is becoming toxic. 

still, in my heart of hearts, i love her so much, and cherish whatever weird relationship we have. she says she wants me in her life forever and i do too, but it scares me that she’s only saying that because maybe she wants a backup plan. it just hurts honestly. butt hey, something nice came out of it and i know better stuff is gonna come out of it. 

tl;dr - she responded passive aggressively, i sent her a meme, feel weird."
"Is it okay to ghost my ""it's complicated""? My ex cheated on me with my best friend and I broke up with him a year ago after an extremely hurtful experience where he basically told me I was plan B the entire time. (Not the point, so I'll leave out the details.)

Cut to roughly 6 months later, we get back in touch. He worked on his empathy, went to therapy, opened up to his family about what he did, realized he made a mistake. And so-on. We pushed back and forth for a long time before I eventually decided to give him a second chance. Meanwhile, he wavers between wanting and not wanting to reconcile, because truthfully, it is rough (as it would be after doing such a shitty thing to someone else). We go no contact to get a mental break.

Going into the break I asked what he intentions are, and ""undefined, you know how I feel"" is what I got. Our break is ending soon, and I'm tired. I don't know how he feels. I don't know what he wants. I don't trust him. I believe that there's something worth fighting for when we're in the same room and he's in my sight, but on my own, I'm just emotionally beat down.

I'm a coward. I just want to forget it all happened and just erase this entire thing from my mind.  I don't want to have anymore triggering conversations. I don't want to have any hopes that can be dashed. I don't want to define whether we're friends or not, trying or not, talking or not, taking space or not. I love him. But I'm tired of loving him. Right now, after having some distance, I feel a fragile sense of safety and security and I don't want to break it.

And that's why I want to just ghost him. Maybe I'll need to get closure one day, maybe I'll just forget about it all. What do you think? I know ghosting is a really horrible thing to do, but would it be the right thing to do given the circumstances?"
"I'm feeling like a cheater after a breakup (every person involved is in the 20s)

Me (M) and my gf, who we have shared alot, met parents and extended family, fought loss and family cancer issues together, who I thought was the woman of my life. Have decided to end our relationship, but still liking each other.

This decision was primarily due to the distance, not only because of COVID but because I started a new job abroad and due to long term depressive issues on her side.

We ended on good terms, it was a breakup but we ended with the hope if the stars alling we could re-ignite our passion. Her family even invited me to have dinner with them the night we broke up, which I politely couldn't accept.

In the meanwhile, one of my best friends I met working abroad, also a woman, let me vent with her by text and after a couple of days I developed an attraction to her which she told she had for me too, my body responded very intensively and we even sext and exchanged some semi-nudes.

I've never done anything like this before but even tho I'm supposedly out of a relationship (which was my gf initiative) I feel like I've cheated and that I let everyone and myself down.

I've always prided myself into being a good guy, I was never been outgoing like this. I'm afraid I'll ruin 3 lives (mine and the 2 people involved). And let everyone down.

I don't know how to feel.

And yes I'm still attracted to my friend. But also want my gf (or ex-gf) to be happy, she has been through enough already.

Please help

"Dump my boyfriend or no? My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years now. The other night we got into an argument, he called me mean/derogatory names (which is typical of him whenever we fight) and he also went and downloaded Tinder WHILE we are still dating. He claims he did not actually “use” Tinder, but clearly he was thinking about other women and possibly cheating. It makes me feel like I’m not good enough. We live together in an apartment and our lease is up in two months. I love him but I don’t know what to do...I’m scared to leave and I don’t even know if anyone else would love me. I don’t want to make a mistake, but I know it’d probably be better for me to leave. I am honestly just so beat down and my self esteem has plummeted. any input?"
"My (F23) boyfriend (24) is trying to quit smoking cigarettes and vaping. How can I support him? He started smoking at 14 years old, and has used nicotine many times a day, by vaping and/or cigarettes, every day since then. He wants to be healthier and rid himself of this addiction, but its clear to both of us that it’s going to be extremely difficult for him to kick a ten year addiction. 

I’ve never even tried a cigarette or used nicotine in any way, and hardly anyone else in my life has ever been addicted to nicotine, so I don’t really know what my role in this might be or what to expect. I know it’ll be one of the hardest things he’ll ever have to do, but I know he can do it and I want to be as supportive as i can be.

I would really appreciate any advice on how I can be supportive/helpful to him, or it’d be great to hear successful quitting stories from people who have been through this. 

Thank you!"
"My sister is cheating on her boyfriend, do I have the right to be upset? Let start off by saying my sister's current boyfriend is shit. We've all established that. Anyway, one day my sister was taking a shower, and her friend walked in and took a shower with her like 2 minutes later. I talked to her about and she told me that she wouldn't cheat on someone she loved. Now, that's kinda reasonable but I mean, why can't she wait until her and her current boyfriend are done? I've never really been in a super serious relationship. Anyway, today they both just disappeared from the house and I went and looked for them. And the spare room downstairs was locked. I can only assume what they were both doing. I'd like to say it's not really any of my business, but my sister kinda made it my business by telling me private things regarding her relationship, and I don't feel right about it. In the end I think more people than necessary are going to be hurt.

I should mention I'm not trying to make her relationship my business, I'm making sure my opinion on her relationship doesn't affect the validity of my support for her wellbeing."
"i’m (18, F) ready to live together but he (20, M) isn’t. tw // abuse, child abuse, drug mention 


i know we’re young, but i’m hoping this will be taken seriously despite that. 

my boyfriend and i have been together for 8 months. it’s one of those situations for both of us where we’ve known we love each other since the beginning and we’re committed to one another. we know we want to spend forever together, get married, have a kid, move away, etc. but for now, we both live with our parents. 

his relationship with his parents is turbulent and they’re generally verbally and emotionally abusive towards him. they play with his emotions, yell at him for minor mistakes and big issues, guilt trip him, change their mind on what’s okay and what isn’t in the blink of an eye, etc. he cowers at loud noises and shuts down when he even thinks someone is mad at him. his dad has been physical with him once in his life, and it’s caused him to be scared of him. he flinches when i play fight with him or jokingly act like i’m gonna hit him. i’ve comforted him while he’s laid in my bed, curled up in a ball, crying and shaking because he’s scared to go home. it breaks my heart to see him so scared to go somewhere that he’s supposed to feel safe. i love him to death but i lose my patience sometimes because i wish he would stand up for himself and find his voice. 

my parents are extremely lenient. they don’t care what i do, as long as i’m safe and not hurting anyone. my dad smokes weed and my parents allow my bf and i to smoke at my house. my bf smokes at his house but takes a lot of precautions so that he doesn’t get caught, which he’s terrified of. my parents adore him. they ask all the time when he’s coming over again. they’ve told him countless times that he’s welcome here no matter when. my bf always tells me how comfortable he is here and that he feels like he can just exist without being scared. he’s still hesitant to leave my room and talk to my parents, but that’s something that i think will be present in him no matter where he lives. not to mention my bf is in love with my cat and i think he misses her more than he misses me sometimes. 

my parents and i have told him that he can move in whenever he wants to. i’ll admit that i’ve stressed it to him and keep bringing it up and pushing it, but i thought the only issue was that he was nervous to talk to his parents about it. he told me a few days ago that he isn’t ready. i thought he was, which is why i kept pushing it and looking for apartments and considering all of our living options. 

i feel horrible now that i’ve been pushing this and he simply isn’t ready. i also feel embarrassed and like i’m being selfish because it’s hard for me to understand. i’m the type of person who jumps into things and just does things if i wanna do them. i’m struggling with him not being ready. i don’t know if it’s a valid thing to be upset by, or if i’m just rushing something that doesn’t need to be rushed. the last thing i want to do is make him feel like he has to move in with me. i feel like i’m supposed to make him be ready. i struggled with this when i thought he was ready, so now i’m worried i’ll get even more impatient now that i know he isn’t. i just feel that him living with me would be a good step for our relationship, as well as possibly helping his anxiety. 

i’m very back and forth with my emotions, obviously, and i guess i can’t pick a side. i love him with my whole heart and truly want to spend the rest of my life with him. i know he’s just as in love with me and committed to me, but isn’t ready to go at the same pace. sometimes i tell myself he doesn’t love me but that’s my insecurity talking. should i be upset? is it valid to be upset, or should i get over myself and let him take his time? am i selfish for feeling like this? i’m so eager to live with him but i don’t want to scare him away or make him feel like somethings wrong with him or that he’s not enough."
"Am I (f20) an idiot for wanting to forgive my ex boyfriend (m21) and want him back? We were together for over a year, we broke up in January. 

We broke up over a lot of misunderstandings. I was unhappy, he was unhappy. Our circumstances got the best of both of us (he had to move out of his apartment to find a new one, terrible job, no car, etc.) and me (trust issues, classes are hard, work gave me less hours). I’ve convinced myself for the past 3 months of us parting way that I hate him. I hate that he didn’t want to fight for us anymore at the end, I convinced that we were incompatible based on our political views and future thoughts (marriage, kids, etc.). 

I coincidentally saw him yesterday at Walmart. I was shocked! And we talk for a bit and he told me we should keep in touch. So I met up with him today to sort things out and he said he wants to get back together with me. I still truly believe that I love and care for him. I did talk a lot of crap about him with my family and some friends (just cause I was convincing myself to hate him — resent him for breaking up with me). It’s natural, I think. My stepdad doesn’t like him because of how he intervened with my adoption, saying he’d never want to see his face again. Which is acceptable after how he saw I was hurt when him and I broke up. 

I am considering on getting back together. I’m gonna admit that. But I am so afraid of the judgements of others in my life. Maybe I should’ve waited longer to talk to him again because my love for him is still there. I told him that we will discuss this more when quarantine is over or something. He said okay. I told him to think really well about what he truly wants, as we know we were both unhappy at some point in our past relationship, because we don’t want to end up the way we did again if we do get back together. 

I hate that no matter how much he hurt me, I still want to forgive him. He apologized sincerely, owned up with everything he did that caused me great pain, and genuinely asked for another chance. I told him I need some more time. He said he’ll be waiting.

Thoughts? Advice? Comments?"
"I keep worrying about my man catching covid-19 and dying and then his death would make me so depressed. But this hasn’t happened but it’s worrying me? I met this wonderful guy and we have been together 2 years.....

He’s great...he’s sweet and thoughtful...and he’s respectful. He says he loves me. I really think I met my soulmate after kissing so many toads. 

I am just so worried because we are older and he is going to turn 60 in August. He also has a breathing problem from smoking cigarettes all his life....but he quit smoking cigarettes because of the fear of coronavirus. Actually we quit together. I thought his jacket smelled like smoke the other day but I didn’t say anything. I think He is upset because when he was smoke free for a month he gained 20lbs and idk if he picked up again because he was self conscious because he is a very tall man and he gets big all over? 

I just worry about him getting covid-19 and me losing the one man that ever treated me right??? 

I have no friends and I was single a long time before I met him and I hated it. 

I also don’t and can’t have children and he is Ok with that. 

I enjoy his company so much and I enjoy eating takeout with him in bed like we always do and I also like having sex with him and watching tv with him and just being overall lazy with him and talking to him. He is so thoughtful.... like if I watch one of his movies with him he will sit through one of my tv show episodes with me too. 

I am just worried about losing him...we might even get married some day and I’ve never been married before. 

How can I stop worrying about him catching covid-19? I worry about my parents getting it too...do you think they will come up with a cure or vaccine very soon? 

Have you ever lost your significant other or husband or wife prematurely?"
"I don't know how to make things right Hi I'm in a bit of a situation here. Basically I have said something to my girlfriend about her dad getting covid-19 (I said that if he did get it which he most likely will as he is a key worker and he goes out to the shops etc.., he will still be fine as he is a healthy man) and she has basically told me to not talk to her. I though okay she is on her period (she is) so it's just that. I face timed her the other day and she was all like ""why the fu*k haven't you been messaging me and asking how I am"". I was just about to ask you that and just kind of flipped out and started crying, I always tell her that I love her, however i dont actually think she understands how much i love her.

I'm just wondering because she is getting a hard time from her friends and I dont know what to do now 😔

Thanks for help, Robert"
"i (16f) got in a fight with my parents (60f 60m) and had a emotional/mental breakdown which made them more mad. how do i handle it? throwRA, on mobile, and am having a complete breakdown in my room right now, so my apologies in advance for formatting and being all over the place. 

TLDR; my parents get upset at me for having breakdowns when they're the ones who caused it, and not only can they not understand my perspective on anything but they also can't understand/accept they have severe faults that impact me very negatively. 

for some background, my parents are kind of narcissistic, don't understand mental illness, and aren't empathetic to my emotions. they're the kind of parents who believe they're always right no matter what just because they're the parents and i'm the child, they call me names (terrorist, crazy, bitch, a burden, etc), they gaslight me, etc.

as the title says, we got into a fight about literally nothing, it was a misunderstanding on their part and wouldn't have been a fight at all if they tried to listen to what i was saying. they were thinking i was deliberately trying to disobey the rules we have in place about masks outside of the house and i was therefore untrustworthy, irresponsible, and heartless. from my perspective, i was trying my best to comply to the rules (there wasn't a single mask in the house that fit me because my face is too small and they all droop below my chin so i used my sleeve to cover my face when i walked by someone on my walk ~ there's not a lot of people out in my neighborhood but i of course stayed as far away from everyone as i could anyway, aNd my mom was with me the whole time). i totally agree that the rules about masks should be in place, and i have no problem obeying them. i don't want to catch or spread this virus any more than they do. however, when i was trying to convey that to my parents, instead of understanding me, they took it as me arguing with them, me still not wanting to comply, the whole shebang. no matter how many different ways i tried to explain it, they just weren't getting it. 

well, i started to get more and more upset, and i'd been crying for a while and eventually i just got to the point where i couldn't handle it anymore. i started to shut down, just putting my head down in my hands and breathing too fast uncontrollably, sobbing harder every second. and they started to get angry and annoyed at me for it! they actually thought i was doing it to be dramatic and get attention or to get my way or something ! and they started talking to me louder, in more harsh tones, and saying ""oh, come on!"" ""you're being dramatic and it's unacceptable"" and other things that made it worse every second. i tried to tell them to please stop, that they're making it worse, to please just leave me alone because i need a break, and in response they just started yelling at me to shut up and getting annoyed and were totally baffled as to why this was happening. i got to the point where i couldn't speak anymore and i could do nothing but listen to them insult me further before they left the room. 

now, i'm in my room, breaking down on my bed and i don't know what to do. how do i handle these overwhelming feelings? how can i tell them to never do that to me ever fucking again in a way they'd understand? someone, just please help me i don't know what to do

note: i have a therapist that i've been going to with my parents to try to prevent conflict between us, but i think they see it as a way to fix me as if i'm a problem that needs to be solved, and maybe i am. they just don't seem to be able to accept that in order to have a good relationship, both parties need to be compromising and working on their own issues. they blame everything on me and put all the responsibility to fix stuff on my shoulders. whenever i try to explain that what they're doing affects me negatively they turn it back on me and say ""stop victimizing yourself, you're in the wrong here"" ""you're just trying to manipulate us into getting your way and you're controlling the situation"" and ""you use therapy as a way to make us look bad so you get validation for your twisted mindsets"". my therapist also doesn't see any of this the way i do because my parents act like perfect loving and concerned parents around her, but when she does suggest something they could be working on or ""take my side"" in something even a little bit, they just say ""she's not being effective"" ""this isn't what we're paying her for"""
"mom has become conspiracy theorist last month and i feel helpless my mother has told me she believes corona is all fake, nwo, mainstream media u name it. she is very intelligent and has three academic degrees.

"How can I (18/F) help my boyfriend (20/M) make friends? Hiya, so I’ve been with my boyfriend for a year, I’ve been pretty worried for our whole relationship about his lack of friends- he had a really unusual upbringing that meant he never really stayed in one place and now as an adult he only has two real friends, one who lives hours away and another in a different country. His jobs have always been working with way older guys, like 50s so he’s never really made friends there. It’s really started to bother him lately with loneliness he’s confided in me, and I feel like it puts a strain on our relationship because I’m his only real friend here besides being his girlfriend so he really really clings to me. He’s pretty quiet and doesn’t really like to go out to clubs and stuff but he isn’t antisocial, he doesn’t have trouble making friends it’s just he has trouble meeting people if that makes sense? I was just wondering if anyone had any advice on things I could suggest to him as a way of making some friends his age?"
"I Still Have Feelings For a Friend I have a friend i met in my fraternity when he joined this year (it’s a frat for gay men). When I first met him, I immediately developed feelings about him and soon couldn’t stop thinking about him. I know he doesn’t feel the same way because he told me he didn’t, but I still can’t get him out of my head. I have a serious boyfriend who I’ve been in a relationship with for 6 months, but whenever I jerk off I think of my friend and I feel terrible. I don’t wanna destroy my friendship and I don’t wanna ruin my relationship. Someone please help. I don’t know how to get over this boy and it’s destroying me. I feel like a disgusting person."
"Boyfriend (20M) went too far and wouldn’t listen to me (20F) Red flag or just an accident My boyfriend is usually very sweet, it’s just this time he went too far. He kept touching me and stuff the whole day and I told him that I really wasn’t in the mood and he won’t be able to convince me but he kept doing it. I am really attracted to him and I love him, he’s the sexiest man alive in my eyes and I am crazy about him. But I just really wasn’t in the mood, to be point where the thought of being sexual felt repulsive to me. It’s just a point in my cycle where sex isn’t appealing to me. Then when we were watching a movie he started getting handsy and I asked him to stop and he’d stop and then continue. He started kissing me and I liked it so I was kissing him back and I kept rejecting advances for sex so I thought he knew I just wanted to kiss. But he was going too far and I asked him to stop a couple times and he wouldn’t listen to me and then he started fingering me and I got really upset because I kept telling him no. So I started crying because I wasn’t in the mood at all and he apologized and said he didn’t mean to push me. He said he was really sorry and wasn’t thinking right. I wanted to just finish the movie and then he could take me home (I was supposed to stay the night). He took me home and he texted me this morning and said sorry for being an idiot and he wants to move past this. I want to tell him that he needs to respect my boundaries even though we’re dating and very open with each other. but I don’t know exactly how to word my message. Can I have help? And also, this was pretty bad but it’s not a huge red flag right? He never did anything like that before, I guess he was just extra horny. Also a part of me feels kinda stupid for crying and overreacting. We have sex all the time so I can’t blame him for touching and trying stuff, I just wasn’t in the mood then. He’s my boyfriend that I know and love, he’s not like some strange creep so I wish I didn’t cry. So I feel like I need to apologize for that too because it probably freaked him out."
"Big problems between me (m17) and my gf (f16) and im stuck in a corner not knowing what to do. Where do I start. (ill make stuff quick) *IF YOU WANNA SKIP BACKSTORY SCROLL DOWN*

I grew up in a small town with a small class, never really had too many friends. Transferred to a bigger school for highschool and met my current girlfriend the very first day. We hit it off, and she was obsessed with me...has been ever since. I'm not sure what is happening tho because lately ( last couple months) have been getting into stupid arguments and act childish sometimes. It's tough to explain because I can assure you its not bad fights just ones that tick you off ""why is this a thing"" type fights.

Recently a whole nude fued between my gf, my basically only other friend and I, and it was a whole problem because I looked like a f-boy. My gf wanted to see them after my friend pointed out that a girl (my family friends daughter and my sisters best friend) nudes got leaked. I had to save them to show my gf (long story) and days later she found out I had them saved (my camera roll is clogged with sm shit, I never clear it out, nor did I have any intentions of using or keeping them on purpose) and she, exaggerating everything, threatened to make shit up and tell the girl that I had them and my gf would make me do stuff for her like get her nuggets or she would lie to the girl (a total bitch that would ruin my name if found out).

One day she was one button away from telling the girl, but her sister told her not to but I didn't think she was going to listen to her sister. I cracked and decided to tell the girl my side and cover my ass. This girl was on my side. This started a whole fight. this girl and MY SISTER (reminder, they are best friends) start cyberbullying my gf. They are spreading lies and rumors about my gf being toxic when she obviously isn't. My parents won't take either side when mine is obviously the right one. I'm being torn apart by my gf of 3 years, my sister, parents, and the nude girl. 

The reason I came here is because my gf. I think I've lost her for good. She used to be so. obsessed. with me. I loved it. We were best friends as well as partners. She was basically my only friend. Now, she is distanced herself so much from me. She claims that she just needs time but I see her in our groupchats living it up. Every time I hop on xbox to listen to music I see her in a party with my ex-friend group, and I join occasionally to hear her giggling constantly with them, a giggle I can never seem to squeeze out anymore and it kills me. I used to be her happiness and I can't take having the guys that pick on me be the ones that make her happy. When I bring it up she tells me to stop being jealous. I'm not allowed to have girl friends (ones that I cut off for her) but she can?

 This is tearing me apart and quaretnine doesn't help much either. Please tell me what to do, give me words of advice or how to talk to her. Thank you so much for reading and I need your help so much because I can't go to my parents for this. They don't understand."
"I (24F) feel neglected in my relationship and I tried to fix myself but he (27M) feels manipulated because of it We've been together about 2 1/2 years and living together for most of it. I've often felt that we dont spend enough quality time together and this has been the source of many arguments. We've been in quarantine and I've felt the loneliest I've ever felt in the relationship. We dont have many of the same interests and it feels like spending time with me is a chore for him. I've tried to find things we both like so we can spend time together but he just sees it as something he enjoys that I sometimes do and doesnt care if I'm there or not. We dont have much of a sex life either, unless I initiate everything and then I usually get told to be quick. I feel very neglected and I dont know what he gets out of the relationship that I'm missing.
He always says he relaxes in a different way than I do but that seems to be spending time with everyone but me. It makes me feel like a burden on him if spending time together isnt relaxing or that enjoyable.

 Whenever I bring these things up it we just end up arguing about the validity of these statements and bickering over whether we spent time together or not. I cant tell any more if my feelings are justified or if I'm insane and imagining everything. It's got to the point where I feel like I need video or audio evidence of the things I bring up or he will just dismiss everything I say as not factual and blame me for having these perceptions of him.

I decided that maybe I just put too much pressure on him to do things with me or talk to me so for the past few weeks I decided to stop doing that and let him be the one to decide when he felt like spending time together. At first it was like living with a stranger but slowly he would ask me how I'm doing or give me a hug every now and then. He even stopped his gaming at dinner time a few times so we could eat together. I told him this after a huge row yesterday and he feels manipulated and like he cant tell what I'm thinking or doing. He said he wished I'd come to him to talk about it but I was really trying to avoid another argument because they're so unpleasant and never lead to any positive outcome.

He said he needs time to think about all this but I have a suspicion he will just wait until things are less tense and then go back to normal. I cant continue with normal.

Theres a lot more to this but this is already long enough.

I just dont know what to do now, any suggestions?"
"im (17m) at a loss to if i should contact an old friend (18) that i didnt end things correctly with Basically to keep it short and whatnot I have this friend that I have not ended things with on a good term. We felt differently on our enjoyment of talking to each other, and the person wanted a break to think things through. Well I didnt take it that great and just deleted the app that we talked on and left it at that. We havent talked for a few weeks now, and before overall our friendship has been shaky due to things that happened between us that made it hard for both of us. Im thinking of coming again to the person as a friend but I find it tough since what if they feel like they want a break again, we've been through so many breaks that it feels like thats all we ever do instead of just talking and vibing you know? Should I reach out again?"
"About to turn 30 been with my boyfriend for 10 years and I am at a cross roads in life My birthday is in 1 month and I will be turning 30. I feel like when I was younger, I pictured myself married with kids &amp; home. Well that is not the case I have been with my boyfriend for 10 years we live in apartment together, but I just can’t see past what we have at the moment right now. 

He sometimes has bouts with depression and just doesn’t really talk about getting married or having kids and when I bring it up he says we will but I know it’s just to pacify me. I know, he wants these things but he’s unhappy with himself and his life and doesn’t have a savings account to do these things. 

I love him a lot but sometimes I picture could there be more to life? Is there someone out there for me who will give meet my needs and wants? I just don’t know what to do or what I should do ?"
"How so I (m22) know if he (m22) is interested in me? I met him a couple months ago but I didn’t like him before. We were just friends but we always go out. I am gay but not out (no one knows that I am gay). We go out with our friends before but ever since they went back to their home countries, we’re the only one left here. So we always go out and eat, go to park and beaches. And we talk a lot, like we spend most of our time just sitting and talking. He never had any girlfriend before, he said before that he couldn’t because of his family. When I told him recently that I will introduce him to someone he said he is no longer looking for one because he wants to focus on his self.

This is not supposed to happen but I’m starting to like him. I don’t know how, but I feel like he likes me as well but wouldn’t show because we are both guys.

How do I know if he is also interested in me?"
"How do I [F 22] and my boyfriend [M 29] recover from a very big misunderstanding? The short version is that we had a massive misunderstanding that resulted in many huge fights and a lot of harsh things said over a period of about a month.

Today we were finally able to resolve the issue - we needed information from someone and they finally provided it which entirely changes the situation. 

I am wondering how we can recover from this. Basically, my boyfriend did not do anything wrong and neither did I and now we understand this, but have been so aggressively angry for many weeks and I don't know how to just start to connect again. We want to stay together but now things just feel really cold and distant."
"Me (29f) keep having fights with husband (35m). I'm thinking of ending things to prevent a lifetime of misery (for the both of us); what are your thoughts? I don't want to keep this post very long but I need help and perspective.  So here it goes...

I've been with my husband for three years. Throughout the years, we kept fighting and yelling at each other. Our fights tend to escalate, and it got to the point where we were insulting each other and banged things out of anger and we almost threw things at each other. We saw how bad that was so initially we sought therapy but that didn't help much. So we ended up having ""talks"" every week using the book The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work. We've been doing this for roughly 2 months now, so we haven't really covered much in it. 

Anyway, he and I have been trying to change our behavior to improve our relationship. It's a process, but lately our fights have been thought provoking for me. When we fight, for him his issues about me revolve around me not being able to follow through with what I say I will, and that I don't answer his questions (he wants me to be direct and answer his question instead of beating around the bush or going off on a tangent), and that I am selfish, he thinks that his feelings don't matter because we'll end up doing what I want anyway; my wants trump his, and that I'm pouty and bitchy when I'm upset instead of just trying to talk and hash it out to prevent it from building up.

For me, my issues are that he yells at me and namecalls and insults, and mocks me when we fight, that when I tell him my issues, he just ends up being upset and that we end up talking about his issues, which then results to us not discussing what I'm upset about (which gets frustrating cause it just ends up getting bottled up) so I don't feel like he can address me when I'm upset or that he really listens to what my issues are because before that even happens, he's already reflexively talking about his, and that because I didn't fulfill what he wanted then, then who am I to have needs. I feel like I don't get the support and the words I need to hear when I share to him why I'm hurt, why I feel a certain way or how I feel a certain way. When I cry, it just annoys him. He told me that I'm a grown woman and that I should be able to handle my emotions better, that crying is a waste of time because it doesn't solve anything, it just makes worse. Sometimes he would get mad at me when I start crying, even though he knows that I'm an emotional person. 

He told me that because we kept fighting, that he doesn't feel motivated to do anything, he doesn't want to travel with me or to do the talks (but still does it anyway). All he does now since he started working from home is watch TV and play video games on his phone. He told me he is unhappy and gets a lot of stress from me. He told me that if he dies right now it's fine (no suicidal tendencies though). He told me, he's always been upset with me because I lost his trust that I will follow through from the very beginning and that I haven't earned it back. He told me that if I want him to feel motivated, then try to change.

I realized that I feel less inclined and involved. I feel like I want to end things more often. I feel like I cry less about things now and more numb to the situation when we are fighting. I feel like, most of the things he tells me are excuses instead of reasons why he does not feel motivated. I feel less inclined to defend myself because I think I have justified reasons for acting the way I did. Part of me just wants to end it because I'm tired of fighting, part of me feels guilty that maybe he does indeed help and I need to just weather it through and try to change (but I don't think I'll make it any better), and part of me feels like it's unfair how it's always me where the issues come from. 

But then we are doing changes here and there. I notice the small things he does and I do my part too, so I don't know if I should just stay a bit longer until we actually finish the book before making a big decision. But then I don't know if the book is really helping at all. 

Tldr; husband and I keep fighting about the same things. We are demanding changes on each other, and have shown some progress on both of our parts, but I feel that this is hopeless because the way we engage with each other is still the same. What should I do?

Ps, sorry it got lengthy but still missed details. And how dejected the whole post is. A big part of me is just really tired of this."
"How do I [27/m] deal with the happiest relationship of my life [26/f] being put on permanent hold/growing apart because of quarantine? To get a feel for our relationship:

I found a girl (26) who fit into my life like a puzzle piece. I've never had more in common with anyone my whole life, and our interest are quite niche (pilots). She's absolutely perfect. The relationship exploded with love and affection, spending time with each other, all within its first two months, after two months of being friends, since she was dumped in her last relationship in Dec. 2019, and didn't want to rush into anything. But once it got going, it took off like a rocket. She's told me we are a perfect match, and that I'm perfect, and that I bring her so much joy to her life.

Then, quarantine. Because her mom has cancer and is already prone to illness, and live with her, she can't take chances being intimate with me. So no kissing or sex. The first month we kept things going over text and face time, and I felt she was falling more for me because of my effort I was putting into it. Sending flowers, writing and performing songs and she was gushing over me. She is busy studying for her commercial pilot exam next week and has been swamped with studying for that, and her responses have been getting further and further apart, sometimes not responding for a full day. 5 days ago she said she wants me to go with her on a cross country requirement flight, and that ""im her first pick obviously for a copilot, and shed love for me to come (mask and gloves on)"". We talked on the phone recently and I asked her if I was doing anything wrong, and she said ""omg no your perfect!"" but she said she doesn't know how long quarantine will last, and because we weren't together long enough,she can't justify keeping up this constant communication with me, and when others want to talk to her too she feels overwhelmed with texts and freezes and doesn't answer anyone. She says she feels like shes failing me. I asked if she still wants me to send her music I make, and she said "" omg yes of course, tiptoethroughthetu, I LIVE for those"". The next day she canceled the trip with me saying she didn't have time, and without any more explanation. So all around confusing. 
I told her that wasn't the case, and asked if she would prefer to slow down to platonic levels of communication, and only be affectionate on the occasions we see each other in person. (mask and gloves on, holding hands and hugging allowed) I asked if she wants to continue dating after quarantine is lifted, and she said yes. But she hasn't been texting me much, and today I saw online she went and did the cross country flight she wanted to take me on and canceled. Didn't mention it to me at all. things just feel different. I am certain she isn't seeing someone else, she is very paranoid about all person to person contact, and only opened up a bit to see me on occasion. I don't want to be needy and desperate, but its wrecking me, I can't eat. I can't sleep through the night. I don't know what to do. I feel sick all of the time."
"I [19M] and a best friend [20F] have feelings for each other, but we're confused about labeling it We also ended up kissing... but I will start with the context and then provide the dilemma. This started as being pretty ramble-y and I've tried to condense it a lot, hopefully it's clear and not too long. Thanks in advance :)

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

We've been friends for about 8 or 9 years, and I'd say we have been best friends for 3 or 4. She recently got out of a long-term relationship of about 3 years that was fairly serious and we started hanging out more and more during school breaks after that time. We go to colleges on different sides of the country but we talked very frequently. When we were hanging out during winter break (btwn 2019/2020) was when I first thought about maybe telling her I have feelings for her but have always justified ""nah we're just friends"".

We've been hanging out during quarantine (I know, bad us) and we would just chill and watch a movie and talk until late in the night until the other goes home. One night we were talking and- unsure exactly of who instigated it- we ended up holding hands and just talking about stuff. She was pretty awake, I was really tired but still conscious. (No drinking involved during any of this, for the record). The weekend after that, we were talking a lot and she asked me about my personal space issues\* and I ended up using the previous weekend's handhold as an example of that. We ended up cuddling a little bit and just asking each other ""what does this mean?"". She told me that she's always had feelings for me, and after getting out of her relationship she let herself feel those some more and I reciprocated saying ""I didn't know what I felt, but I do know there are many indications that I have feelings for you"" (I'm strange like that). Later I ended up kissing her and we kissed for a while. 

Just the other day we watched two movies and then kissed for a while after that (nothing past kissing/making out). This feels weird sharing this much, but internet anonymity... right? :) Anyway, during that (yea I'm weird) I ended up trying to bring up the discussion of what this means and ""what we are"" and whatever. The weekend when we first kissed we decided not to label it but, as I have a strange view toward intimacy (see **The Dilemma**) it's hard for me not to label it. So I asked again and that's more or less what has brought me here. I do not know what to do or where to go with this.

**The Dilemma**

The dilemma sort of boils down to our different views of intimacy... I think. As I mentioned, she got out of a pretty long-term relationship and has done the *devil's tango* (is that weird? that's pretty weird, but maybe humor will help me type this out) before, and I have not (relevant in a moment). Based on some parental issues, which boils down to my dad having cheated on my mom, I've always seen intimacy (kissing, touching, *devil's tango*) as a part of a relationship. In other words, I'm only interested in intimacy in the scope of some sort of relationship vs. something like hookup culture.

I get the feeling she wants to take it further (intimately), and in a sense so do I. While I have such strong feelings for her, and she towards me, I can't seem to wrap my head around the inability to label the relationship. I'm also so hesitant to take the ""next move"" based on several factors. She has a *lot* going on in her life right now and she's said she doesn't have the mental space to for a relationship- and quite frankly, I don't really think I do either to this degree. I totally get that and respect it. Also we go to college on different sides of the country and, while I always thought long-term relationships would be easy based on my life, even just a week after our first kiss I realized how much I just wanted to hold her. We'll be able to see each other during the summer, but after that... I do not know. She mentioned something about not wanting to be boxed in while at school and again, I totally get that. 

Last night I essentially came to the realization that, while she doesn't want to label this as ""dating"" (and again, I think she's entirely right in saying that because it's the best thing for her), having no label on this keeps me stuck in one place. The closest label we have is ""best friends who kiss"" and the only place I see this going is some ""fwb"" situation... and I don't want that. I've always looked for a relationship and the one time I feel so strongly for someone who reciprocates it, it seems impossible. I told her that she was worth waiting for, but she wouldn't want me to wait. Technically we already ""date"" based on how we hang out as friends, she even mentioned that once we went on a stereotypical date (movie and dinner) and how me cracking a comment about how I've never dated anyone kind of hurt her a little bit because I still saw that as friends.

**The Question**

What do I do and where do I go with this? What questions can we ask each other to find out the answer? We want to be close to each other but my mind seems to have an inability to do anything further- from further intimacy to being in a ""romantic mindset"" without labeling it or having a vision of where this might go in the long-term.

We both talked about going back to being ""just best friends"" but neither of us wants to do that. We like being close to each other, but I don't know what she fully wants if she doesn't have space for a relationship and yet I don't know where I can go without slapping a label on this thing.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Long story short, I always shy away from touch- even hugs from good friends. But I'm comfortable around her.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I don't know how to TL;DR this... best friends who kiss have trouble labeling their relationship but only one of them (me) feels a need for that label?"
"Prebreakup 2 months ahead My boyfriend(24), future ex, wants to break up with me(22) because he wants to focus on himself. Which is fine by me. He lives with me and my family. He doesnt like my family. He's gotten in a lot of altercations with my disabled sister. I was placed in the middle of it and, as you can imagine, they were very stressful moments. I'm a fulltime college student who works part time. My mother helps me a lot by just asking for the bare minimum of $2-400 a month for rent, car insurance, phone, etc. This is her way of showing me she supports my studies. He has family but he isnt close to them because they're very dysfunctional. He comes from a very abusive family and so he doesn't like family. He doesnt like family gatherings and holidays.

I was sad when he told me he was gonna leave after the quarantine gets lifted because I truly loved him. He made it seem as if in the future like in a couple months or so we would get back together. Then, after a week, we go out with my friends but an hour before he tells me after we break up were done for good. I start crying again and he says I shouldn't cry but it's still a sad moment for me. We leave to go meet my friends and we start drinking. After a couple beers I start crying and he asks me what's wrong. My friends comfort me and then we go home. The next morning he asks me why I cried last night and asked if I had told my friends what we talked about. I did talk to them about because they're my close friends and I needed a shoulder to cry on. He got mad thinking that I purposely did all that to make him seem like a bad guy. I didn't talk bad about him once. He also got mad when I asked him not to fix stuff for me. I didnt want him fixing things for me anymore because I was going to think about him when I looked at those things. He got mad because he doesnt want me to forget him. 

As he starts his new job he realizes how dependent he is on me. This is two/three weeks since we last had the talk. I'm somewhat over it because I realized once he leaves I can focus on myself.

Three days into his new job he tells me that he wishes I wasnt so dependent on my family. He wanted me to be able to pick all my shit up and move to a different country with him or state. He said he would stay with me if I did that. He is really confusing me. He talks about the future with me and then he talks about a future without me. Everytime we fight he says he cant wait until he can leave. Somedays he says once he starts getting paid he'll spoil me.

The reason I wouldn't move out with him is because I'm a college student and I want to graduate. Plus, He doesnt have his life together and he's barely living check by check. He aspires to build and create things but doesnt actively want to go to school. It makes me sad because I see potential but I dont think he cares. I cant move out with someone when I am living a comfortable life with my mother. I dont want to work to support myself as I go to school. I understand it's very hard so I'm grateful that my mother is caring for me like this. He doesnt understand how difficult it will be for me to attend school full time while working to support not only me but us. I also have cancer and so I cant work a full time job because I need the state benefits to cover my medical costs. I forgot to mention that he said if my cancer ever gets bad he'll leave because his grandparents died of cancer and he doesnt want to relieve it. This one hurt the most because I did not choose to have cancer
 He knows that I went through cancer all alone without my family by my side. 

He says he loves me and all but I dont feel love. I feel stress. It's hard for me to let him go when he's here constantly. When he sees me cry sometimes he says that I shouldn't cry. He wants us to act normal as if I didnt know he was leaving. He wants to be intimate like before. He gets bothered whenever I bring it up. For example, he'll tell me ""I dont like when you become moody when your tired"" and I'll say ""Its okay you wont have to deal with it in two months"".

I cant act like everything is normal because I'm trying to get over him. 

I'm lost and confused. I dont know what to do or how to get through this situation. Theres a part of me that cant wait for him to leave and theres another part that is going to miss him. It truly an everyday battle.

TLDR; my current bf wants to move out of my parents house and break up with me in the process. He doesnt want me to cry. He wants me act as if he isnt leaving and gets bothered when I dont. He's always saying he can't wait to leave or he cant wait to do ____ with me. It confuses me. I'm stressed out and upset. I feel so lost and confused right now."
"My parents; (50s M and F) relationship is horrible and it's driving me (21F) insane Obligatory: this is a throwaway since there are people irl who know my actual account. 

My parents are a mixed couple (European mom and South Asian dad) that have been together for almost 30 years at this point.  You'd think everything is fine right? Nope, it is far from fine. I live at home with them and my sister (16F). I'm stuck at home 24/7 like everyone else cuz of corona, but I usually live at home and commute to uni every day. Here's where the shitfest begins.

The number one thing they fight about is money. My dad makes about $140k a year compared to my mom who makes about $80k a year. Every month my mom has to practically beg my dad to send her money so she can pay the bills. My mom handles all of the finances because my dad doesn't know how to and she says she always has since the beginning of their relationship. My dad has some weird obsession with his money, and even though they have a joint account, he accuses my mom of stealing money from him yada yada. For him, it's never \_our\_ money; it's \*his\* money.  He's opened his own accounts now, to keep his money ""safe"". 

He was yelling at my mom earlier today about looking into getting the stimulus check thing from the government (US) due to COVID-19. My mom told him because their combined yearly income is more than $150k a year that they would be ineligible. He started yelling at her and saying that she doesn't do anything right. This year we found out that my parents owe $4k more in taxes this year because my dad got a $16k raise. My mom has been waiting for the right time to tell him before he loses his shit (which just shows you what kind of a situation we're in). My dad's response to everything my mom tells him is that: he pays for everything (he doesn't) and that she doesn't do shit (she does). 

There is always an argument about who does what and who pays what. He gets all of his ideas from his childhood friends on WhatsApp in ways he can ""save on money by not paying his taxes"" or ""writing on his taxes that he makes less than he actually does"". He never believes anything my mom says (who has a fucking degree in finance) and has some complex that she's is out to get him/his money. He very obviously gaslights us because whenever he gets enraged and says/does stupid shit, he says that he never did that and that we're being crazy. It's always my mom's fault or mine. 

Their relationship is so strange in that they constantly mock each other and call each other bad names. I honestly don't remember the last time I hear them say ""I love you"" to each other. But whenever shit goes down, my mom comes into my room and tells me everything (as if I can't hear it from my room) and cries. Of course, this makes me feel bad, but I'm not a therapist. Thankfully my dad is considered ""essential"" so he still has to go work every day otherwise it would be a nightmare. I can't focus when they're like this. But now I'm saddled with the heavy burden of my parents' shitty relationship because my mom has no friends or family in the country we live in. 

My sister and I have told my mom multiple times to divorce him because it is very obvious she is no longer happy. She says she's too afraid to because A. she moved to this country all alone to make a better life for herself, and B. my dad works at a law firm and she is convinced that if she gave him divorce papers that he would make her life a living hell.  I've told her that that's better than living through this shit all of the time. She grew up with an abusive father and tells me all of the time that living here with him is like living with her father. She literally told me today that the day she dies, it'll be by his hands. She tells me that she's tired of being demeaned and told that she doesn't do anything. I feel like she's reliving her childhood trauma. 

I'm honestly at a loss of doing anything at this point. I really think I'm suffering from compassion fatigue because this has been my life for the past 21 years. When she comes into my room and tells me this stuff, I don't even know what to say anymore. I'm convinced that my dad has either bipolar disorder or some underlying illness because his behavior has always been very erratic and he has anger issues. He will never go see a doctor or therapist for it because he's convinced it doesn't exist. He will hit all of us if he's provoked enough. The weird part is that he's not that bad to be around when he's ""normal"" which is probably like 80% of the time.

So now I'm reaching out to the internet because I have nowhere left to ask. I refuse to leave my mom in this situation. How can I help my mom? Is there anything left that I can do at this point? Is there anything that she can do? 

TLDR: living with my dad is like walking on eggshells that are on fire and my mom is suffering which is making me suffer. wtf do I do?"
"Porn addiction? Detached? This is my second ever reddit post... here we go... My husband (29M) has struggled with pornography addiction our entire relationship. At first I (27F) was totally against it but after a few years it became the norm and i became accepting to the fact that most men and women watch porn. I just asked him to keep it to himself. He said okay. We've been together for over 10 years and both have had a rough go. We've both cheated and both lied in our youth (18-23) We moved to another state and started a life together despite that, to try to build a new life and trust for each other. Things were going perfect for a while, minor bumps in the road.. caught him lying about other females multiple times.. but he said he never had sex with them so i just moved on.. We were even recently trying for a baby (I have PCOS and have to go through a fertility clinic.) But recently I was giving him oral and he grabbed his phone and held it over my head while he looked at ""teen porn""? Without even asking me, knowing i wouldn't like that..  and then tried to hide it and lie when i confronted him...(he thought i wasnt paying attention.) well since then i did a little digging and found out he comments on other redditors photos saying they are sexy and any man would be lucky to have them. I feel so uncomfortable to do anything sexual with him anymore. I just can't really get into it, i often ask myself how long has he done this and hid it from me?.. I love him so much and he says he loves me, and wants to work on his behavior.. but doesn't seek help or change anything about the situation and it's just history repeating itself over and over. This feels like a sad joke.. but the thought of not having him in my life really bothers me. I am not in a happy place right now and I really need to find how to self love again. He never comments on my photos or tries to plan dates and fun things like I do. He is just glued to his phone and his porn and photos of other females. He seems detached. I feel alone, and depressed. Any advice or anything would help.."
"still in love (21 F) with my ex (21 M) it’s been about 7 months since I broke up with my ex boyfriend. The breakup was mostly amicable, but ultimately I was the one who decided it was for the best. We were together for 2 years, lived together for half of that. We hung out every day, we were madly in love despite a lot of our own issues.

We talked on the phone a lot after the breakup. You see, we still had the apartment we lived in and went to university together. But when we broke up, I went back to school because I decided we wouldn’t be able to move on if we lived together etc. 

But two months after the breakup, he started dating his best friend. It was strange and I was upset. I felt I had ‘wasted’ so much of my life in a way. I had at the back of my mind thought of us eventually ending up back together. 
It sucked a lot. I drank a lot. Did drugs. I had this mindset of not caring what happened to me. It was scary and unhealthy. Even now as I write this I feel as though I am so selfish. I know I am.
I was seemingly getting better in the last couple of months. I want to be happy for them. Because I understand that it really was for the best. I was being healthy and looking forward to the future. 
Unfortunately quarantine is here and I have been stuck thinking and thinking about us. I understand I’m lonely. I’m very inexperienced when it comes to these things. I just was so young when we started dating. I’m not sure how to move on. I don’t want to jump into a relationship with these feelings. It sucks the most because he even shows up in my dreams sometimes. I’m constantly thinking, how did he move on so fast? Did he truly love me? 
Am I seeking closure?"
"I want to break up with my partner, for the wrong reasons Recently I’ve been having a crippling sense of insecurity in myself. My confidence is nonexistent in the bedroom and in everyday life. No matter what my girlfriend tells me I know deep down I’ll never believe she loves me. I know deep down that I’ll never believe she isn’t faking. I know deep down that if I bought her a sex aid I’d think she was replacing me with it. I know deep down that I will never be comfortable in my own skin. I’ve been trying for 24 years and I haven’t pushed an inch in a good direction. All of this is why I want to break up with my partner. I’d be devastated to not have them in my life but I upset them so much with my insecurity. I don’t feel good during sex because I’m too worried about my inadequacies. I want so badly to spend the rest of my life with them. But I’ll never love myself in a way that doesn’t make it painfully clear to me that I don’t feel good enough. And as long as she’s gone I won’t have anything to be insecure about. Please I need help, anything. To be honest it’s making me suicidal."
"The girl I was talking too dog died I missed the call right after and she hasn't talked to me in a week Hello, I've been talking to this girl for about 2 - 3 months now and we hung out a few times before I thr corona pandemic. We both agreed to start going out after quarantine was over. So she had this small chihuahua that has stroke problems. It almost died the first stroke but it survived. The second stroke happened and she was really depressed about it it ended up living for another two weeks and it passed while she was holding her. I was giving her space most of the time that she was going through that but I made sure that she knew that she could talk to me about it and that I was here. She would occasionally message me and we'd talk about it. When the dog passed she tried to face time me but I was going to the bathroom and I couldn't answer I texted immediately after the call went to voice mail and said im sorry to miss ur call ill call u in like 2 min i was going to the bathroom. Sje c explaining how the dog died in her arms and stuff I said im.sorry for ur loss. I then made the dumb decision of asking her if she still wanted me to call she said no and I havent heard from her in a week. I feel really stupid about this and I feel like i severely messed up. I've tried getting a hold of her the next few days and got no response. She will open my snap messages and leave me on read. I don't know what to do and I feel like i failed her. I really want to work it out with her because I really care about her and I don't want this to cause my relationship with her to end. She would post to her private snap her crying about the dog and being very depressed. I don't know wjat to do."
"Ig likes Hi, I’m [25] as is my boyfriend. I’m curious, how would you females feel if you saw IG posts of models with your boyfriend’s comment as fire and heart emojis. I was just minding my own business literally scrolling on search and found his screen name there with emojis next to it ...it was funny at first but the felt like cringey ..so my nosey self went to the people he followed and saw that he does that on his coworker’s posts...she has a boyfriend too. I mean she has really nice photo shoot pics but is that appropriate? I feel a knot in my stomach for snooping and finding that."
"I (F22) feel so sad that my ex (F24) had already found someone new When we broke up, i always thought i will not be sorry for leaving her. Now, everything just gets back to me because i recently found out that she has already found someone new. At first, i was really happy for her. Sooner, everytime i see her posts with her new girlfriend, i feel so jealous. I feel like i don't have the rights to be jealous because i was the one who left her in the first place. It just feels kinda off because no matter how hard i try to avoid thinking about it, it just breaks my heart. Its not like i don't want her to be happy, believe me, i really want her to find someone new. I just didn't expect it to be this hard for me. I really thought i was over our relationship. Turns out, i was just not paying attention to it. I don't really have questions tho, i just want to share something because all my friends also think that me, being the one who left in the relationship, i shouldn't have remorse or guilt whenever my ex finds someone new.

Edit:

I'm just curious, if you're the one who got someone new, do you guys still stalk your ex. If yes, does it feel good that you are now in a good position than your past? Or do you guys feel guilt as well?"
"me (male 26) need advice please I've been in this relationship for nearly 9 months , it started out so great, but ever since this quarantine hit due to the virus , things seem to have slowed down.

a little background info, ive been in abusive relationships both physically and mentally , and this is like my first normal relationship and im terrified because we went from talking a lot and enjoying life to being separated from each other due to the virus, i lost my work where she works because i didn't work there long enough. at first it was school and work getting to her because of finals but texting still has slowed down a lot and its been a lot of me coming up with conversations . we use to talk so much about things we wanted to do with each other and now its slowed down...... am i just over thinking a lot of this

(F24) My bf (m29) claims he has no sex drive but masterbates every day We’ve had a problem with our sex life being consistent for a long time. He blames it all on his performance issues and anxiety. We’re at the point now where we don’t have sex at all and intimacy is rare. But he masterbates every morning while he thinks I’m asleep. I hate this
???? Over the course of a year you find evidence on your s.o.(husband/wife you are married) phone 3 times that they are cheating and each time they say they are going to stop but they don't. After the affair actually ends you find out(not from them).that they continue after they said they would stop. What would you do? The affair is over but not until months after they were caught.
"Walked in on my girlfriend helping herself and she was upset. What do I do moving forward (21M and 21F) I know this seems ridiculous but i never had to deal with this situation before and I don’t want things to be awkward, we just moved in together and idk how to handle this. She’s my first like long term relationship and I don’t wanna mess this up 

My girl was in the bathroom and she said she was going to take a shower, I decided to join her and our bathroom lock is moody sometimes it locks sometimes it doesn’t. And I figured out if I push it a certain way then it opens. so that was my fault I should have knocked or waited but ok I was excited. But I didn’t think it was a big deal, I just figured she was on the toilet or something and we see each other naked all the time. I was trying to save time from waiting for her to finish up on the toilet then open the door. I admit that was my mistake. 

She was helping herself out and stopped when I came in. I didn’t think it was a big deal and I even told her it was really hot and turned me on like crazy seeing her. And I started helping her and then she asked me to stop and she was crying and said she felt embarrassed. I told her she had nothing to be embarrassed about it and it was really hot. Like I was complimenting her a lot and stuff but she was still upset and she wanted to shower alone. So I left her alone and then she went to bed so we didn’t really talk 

this morning we had breakfast and she seemed ok. Idk what to ask like “are things good now”?? Not sure. Idk I don’t wanna offend her"
"I (25F) have been dealing with depression, anxiety, and a lot of negative behaviors. My boyfriend (23M)refuses to take a break for me to work on my mental health. Should I break up with him for both our sakes. First of all I want to say I have the sweetest, kindest, most patient boyfriend. He says that he wants to be there for me and help me get through this but I get irrationally sad and angry and cry daily. I feel like I’m miserable to be around and I just want him to be happy. I am unbelievably in love with this boy but I don’t want him to resent me or end up hating me. I want to be better not only for myself but for him and rn I feel like I’m just hurting him. Should I just let him be there for me? He knows everything when it comes to my anxiety, self hate, even my eating disorder, he knows all the bad stuff and wants to stay. Should I let him stay or should I break up with him to let him find someone who isn’t so miserable?"
"My [30 F] bf [30 M] only masturbates to tit fucking. Is it normal? Been dating about 1.5 yrs but stopped having frequent sex around the year mark.
I’ve never heard of dudes focusing on ONE very specific form of porn. Is this typical? My biggest concern is that I’m very flat chested and wondering if he’s lost all attraction for me. 
I’ve never been self conscious about my breasts and now feeling extremely low and like a troll."
"Disrespectful inconsiderate roommate My roommate deliberately plays loud music to invoke a negative reaction from me. He will stare at me and keep turning it up until I react. I have asked him every time he does it (3 to 4 times a week) to stop, but he doesn't, and many times will just turn it up louder. 

After a few weeks of him doing this I accepted it and after I realized he was just trying to get me to react, I would laugh it off, but after a while it really distracts me from what I'm doing. If I am doing a good job not reacting and minding my business he will throw things at me or take something of mine until he gets a reaction out of me. 

I have never gotten physical about it until tonight because that's the last thing I've wanted to do but nothing else has worked. I pinched him a few times with my big gloves on until he actually started to talk to me and said I'm being a jerk and left. When he gets bored the only thing he can think to do is blast his music, take my stuff and hide it, throw his dirty socks at me, empty bottles and state at me until I react. I am usually very polite but tonight he pushed me too far. 

TL;DR my roommate deliberately plays loud music to irritate me and I've finally had it"
"My [20M] ex [21M] needs a place to stay for school but I am uncomfortable having him here My ex, who I recently broke up with, moved back home after living with me for a year and he decided to go to school still in my area. He asked me about moving back in with me as friends, which we are good friends now, but something about him staying here again makes me feel uncomfortable. I have a guilty feeling right now that makes me feel like I am leaving him out in the dirt, but I do really feel uncomfortable about him living here. We decided to be a bit more like FWB, but I dont want to lead him on either as I have sort of dropped the love feelings I had for him before. He is a nice person, but to see him living on his own in an area he is not from with no friends makes me feel very sorry and sad for him. I have grown rather fond of being single now and feeling like I can be my own person and free and make new connections, but I feel selfish in a way because of my position. Any advice for calming a guilt conscious?"
"I’m not really sure how to handle this I love my boyfriend, and his family. But there’s one person who I cannot stand and we LIVE with him. It’s his father. I’ve heard varying stories on why his parents got divorced, but from what I understand and see, he’s a drinker and a worker and that’s it. Aside from that little info here’s what’s been bugging me. 

A few days ago I was smoking with my boyfriend’s cousin, (his dad’s niece) and she was telling me about how one of the neighbor kids said “ Bingus loves me more than you.” (We’ll call him bingus on this post). I wasn’t too worried about it until the cousin told me that he’s planning on visiting his home state to bring his daughter home for the summer. 

And he wants to take the neighbor kids with him. 

They’re all varying in age, the oldest is 16 and is the best friend of his daughter. And the other is maybe 11. That put up so many red flags. I’ve always been kind of off put by how the neighbor kids seem to be attracted to him, and how they’re always in the house, and if he really plans on taking them to pick up his daughter, I’m concerned. 

At first a friend of mine said “maybe you’re just over looking things. You’re awkward he’s awkward it’s a bad combo” but now they’re telling me to maybe look at his computer and make sure there’s nothing bad going on. 

I’m scared. I’ve never been in this kind of situation and it’s freaking me out please help reddit :(("
"How can i balance work and my long distance relationship? (F16) (M17) This is my second job that I’ve ever had, I just got hired today. During my first job I wasn’t in a long distance relationship but now that I am and I’ll be working weekends as well (probably full time I’m not sure yet because I only got part time during weekdays because of school) i don’t know how I can balance my relationship and work. Me and my girlfriend only live an hour away and see eachother once a month every Sunday when my mom drives me to go hang out with her for a whole day but since I’m going to be working weekends and we have school during the weekdays I don’t know how seeing her will go.

"How do you trust the people you are dating? Hey,

So I (f19) have been talking to a guy for about 2 months now, and have gone on 3 dates where he had stayed over, but nothing happened. We only kissed. But thats not really important. I know he is busy and he texts me almost daily, so he does give me enough attention. But I still feel like his intentions aren't true and he is just dating me out of boredom or something? Even though I have no real reason to think this.... He is really sweet and he never made me feel uncomfortable. But I still feel like that... And I know he knows that I doubt him, because he has asked. But then I just say nothing, because I cant really explain why I feel like that. Do I just have trust issues from my previous relationship? And how do I cope with that? I don't want to ruin this, even though we are only just going out. Thanks for reading."
"How do I (17F) stop loving my bitch of a sister (14)? I’ll try my best to keep it short. I realize this might get downvoted a lot, but all I want is help to control my feelings. 

When I was younger, I was bullied a lot by my cousins. I was too young for them and so not only did they exclude me from everything they did but they tried their very best to make sure that I feel like an outsider. When my sister was born, I saw this as an opportunity to bully the shit out of someone in return, so I treated her horribly: I treated her just like how I was treated by my cousins. I made fun of her, excluded her, etc etc.

Around when I was 13, I realized how shitty of a sister I was. Which is why from then on I always gave her all of my love. I would wanna play with her, show her my affection, support her in any way I can. I adored her. I loved her like a big sister should love her little sister.

But nothing I do seems to change my mistakes. I created a horrible monster. She has no respect for me as her big sister. She has no love for me. She’s extremely rude. She always points out my flaws. She’s always arguing with me. She’s SUPER disrespectful. She always enjoys humiliating me. An example would be how I broke down in front of my family once bc depression and my sister told me that I ruin everything for my family. I wouldn’t be as hurt if that came out if my parents bc they’re from a different generation and culture, but it came from my sister. It breaks my heart, because I love her so much. She’s my little baby.

I always wanted to apologize to her before for being a bad sister to her. But seeing the person she has become (even though it’s completely my fault for taking all my bullying trauma out on her and therefore turning her into a devil), I realize that I don’t want to apologize anymore. I don’t wanna fix our relationship. That is out of the question for me. Call it ego, call it years of hurt feelings from loving someone who treats you like shit. I don’t want to apologize. The only thing I want to do is stop loving her and stop feeling sad every time she’s mean to me.

Can anyone give me any advice? How do I stop caring about my sisters horrible behavior towards me? She’s just too mean. It hurts too much. I don’t wanna love her anymore."
"Everyone sexualizes me Growing up I remember having to learn how to love on my own. My parents didn’t really have time for me. My mom let her 25 year old boyfriend rape me when I was ages 8- 11. My father is remarried with a new son and he always put my younger brother first. I am 22 female now. I have this guy who I use to have a crush and we dated once when I was 15 one day he broke my trust by kissing my bully and lying to my best friend about me. I grew up wishing he would change this guys has been on my  mind constantly no matter who I was with, where I was , or age I turned. I moved back to Ohio in May 2018 and I saw the guy I so much cared about but I didn’t want to show it. I wanted us to take things slow. He didn’t get the memo and he moved on with another girl. I was crushed because before my grandmother died she told me to make it right with him, and my best friend always told me how much he wanted to be with me, her mom told me how much this guy liked me. I cried for a whole week and forced myself to move on. A year goes by I still regret us not hitting it off I had a new boyfriend. It’s now January 2020. My childhood crush/ ex comes back into my life. We lock eyes and we started hanging out almost everyday. I broke up with my boyfriend because I really loved the other guy. I kept dreaming of him and he would cross my mind non stop. We ended up having sex this year. I gave in because I was scared he would leave me this time if I didn’t. I became vulnerable I opened and expressed all my love for him and anger and why I would wait for him. He told me he needed space because he felt as if all I wanted to do was have sex. I have been crying everyday since April it’s now May. HELP . I don’t know if I should apologize or curse him out. I really want us to talk about it but he is acting like he doesn’t care or avoiding me. What should I do?"
"I (30/f) struggle to want a relationship due to this issue. Do most men in relationships fantasize about other women they encounter sexually? If so, is this because the woman you’re dating isn’t attractive enough? I’m 30/f who hesitates about dating due to that insecurity. I have been in the beauty and modeling industry since my teens where every feature is analyzed and compared to others openly so I have definitely been focused on maintaining and constantly improving my body and overall appearance. 

I have heard that men even when initially dating will constantly fantasize about other women they see sexually. If this is the case, is it because you don’t find the girl you’re with as gorgeous or beautiful as other women? Would you openly tell the woman you’re with how she could improve her looks or let her know what you found attractive about the another women? So should could improve for you? 

Any feedback would be great! Thank you!"
"Help with overthinking during a break in my relationship Hi guys,

Me and my girlfriend have recently taken a break in our relationship, mainly due to the lockdown and us not being able to see each other has made it difficult for us to maintain a steady conversation on FaceTime/text etc... 

She suggested for us to take a break in order to refresh our minds and continue on forward, which is great. However, I keep overthinking and putting myself in mental situations... that it will come to the end of the break and she’ll leave me. I don’t want that to happen. So I’m asking for advice in two areas

1:) how do I stop overthinking about her leaving me?

2:) once the break is over how would I/We able to stay in a better and more healthy relationship?


Any help would be appreciated 😁💙"
"Wedding bells or split up? Hi all. My fiancé (M29) and myself (F26) have been together for 4.5 years and were planning to get married this July. Due to Covid we had to move our wedding. My fiancé and I have recently been having a harder time communicating and it feels like both of us are wondering if we are making the right choice to get married. It scares me that we are so close to getting married and questioning our decision. Has anyone been through this before? Any ideas on what we should do?

"Pregnant girlfriend left me My Ex is 13 weeks pregnant and the first couple months was pretty bad. My family hated the fact she wanted to keep the child and while I tried to support her I didn’t 100%, we was arguing and disagreeing on a lot and she eventually got fed up and left and we still been arguing but getting better and we not talk as much. We agree on everything about the baby and it’s not something I worried about she will try to keep him from me at all. 

But this girl was the most loving person I ever been with, I was the idiot in the relationship. I didn’t know what I wanted while she wanted a family, a house and just the American dream type life. But now she don’t want anything to do with me. She talking about I gotta get over her because she might get into new relationships like when she pregnant and talking about she would NEVER give it a chance even if it means a chance at a normal family wich we both wanted at some point at least. 

I was controlling, toxic, rude, mean and everything in the book for a while and she been on my ass about it and I’m changing for the better. But she honestly believes I will NEVER really change and that we could never go together without arguing. But I know we can and don’t know how to show her.

She said I’m the person she fell in love with the fastest, good or not I want to show her I’m the same person that she wanted to spend her life with instead of giving up on the dream of building a normal family. After all my wrongdoings that’s all she can see when she look or talk to me and is there any way to get past something like that?"

So to give you all context, I met this girl from NY (I’m from NJ we’re about 2 1/2 hours away) in the August of 2019 (so about 9 months), during the Fall of 2019 we talked somewhat steadily (about once a week) and ended up going on our first date in January 2020 (right before the apocalypse) during this spring we started getting a lot closer, talking everyday, etc. we even have a show we watch together. We both really want to hang out even though we realize it may be selfish. Firstly because I have a house I’m renting near the college I attend until June (giving us the most privacy we’ll have until she goes back to her college which is 4 hours away from me) and secondly because we want to see each other one more time (at least) before we introduce each other to our parents. What do you think we should do?"
"Making a Long Distance friendship work Long story short, I F27 visited Morocco early last year. I became friends with one of the entertainers M24 in the hotel, and we exchanged social media after a couple of days of speaking. 

Once I returned back to my home country (UK) we carried on speaking eventually speaking via whatsapp and video calls. 

It's been just over a year, and we speak every single day (exchanging over 100+ msgs) video call all the time and have become very very close friends. He is very thoughtful, considerate and genuinely cares about me. There are no romantic feelings involved and we are both genuinely happy where we are at the moment. On a side note, he comes from a wealthy family and has access to visit this country so he is not just talking to me for a passport or visa as anyone may think. 

My question is how can I maintain this long distance friendship, aside from visiting each other as I fly to Morocco at least once a year and he the same. Does anyone have any ideas in terms of a thoughtful gift or something I can do? I've tried to google but only long distance relationships ideas come up."
"Help me asap Im 16, been with a girl for a new month. We had not seen eachother for a long time bc Corona. Party.. sleep.. unprotected sex. She's on her period, so the chances are lower? Is plan b pill the vest option? Fuck me. Help asap"
"I(M) have feelings for a friend and I think she feels the same. But she is in a relationship that is not doing great. Hi,

Not sure if it fits here but...

I am M36yo and I met this girl (29yo) last year (in February) while I was in a relationship already. She was also in a relationship. We started going out with our kids (both our kids became great friends) and doing activities. I started having feelings for her and my relationship was not going great. I knew I had to break it up, so I did in June. 

We started seeing each other a lot and she was telling me it was not going great with her boyfriend etc. I'm not the kind of guy that tries to split people so I jist listened to her problem without giving any advices. I didn't want to give any biased advices... We started to talk more and more and see each other more often too. Obviously her boyfriend got jealous. In July, she texted me saying we could not see each other anymore...

Fast forward to October when she called me back to talk. She admitted that during the summer, she broke things up with me because she told her boyfriend that I was giving her what he could not and finding qualities in my which he was lacking. Also she admitted that she was getting attached to me (not sure if it's how you say it in English, but basically she told me she had feelings for me during summer). We talked a while and I told her that it was mutual and that unfortunately, while she was still with her boyfriend, it would be impossible for us to be friend. That the feelings we had would creep up and come back eventually. 

Then, we stopped talking until February this year. I dated another girl in-between... She called me back. We started talking again. Every days. I was confused, since we agreed not to talk again while she was with him. It lasted about a month. During that time, she had a burn-out and stopped working. She was on medical leave. So we talked all day long.

Then,  she called me one day saying that he found out we were talking and told her to stop. She didn't want to. And she finally admitted that they broke off in October, before she called me, then they came back together and broke off again in February. They got back together when she started being Ill. We stopped talking but she told me that she didn't want to. That she was going to put an end to this as soon as she was back on her feet... We stopped talking again.

Now the quarantine hit. He's living with her now since we are quarantined and she's not happy at all. It's been almost 2 month and a few days ago, she called me again.  And yesterday we did a videochat. She told me that she does not love him anymore but is currently unable to break it off. She want to wait until the quarantine is over to think about the relationship. 

She asked me details (like if I was sleeping with my ex wife that is now quarantined with me and my daughter) and told me stuff that made me think she was checking if I was still available etc.

My ex wife thinks she is not okay to ""have her feet on two boats"" and that she is keeping me on the hook ""just in case"". Seeing all the stuff that happened to us. And knowing her state of mind. I was analysing that she came back with the guy because she was scared to be alone and was not feeling well enough to say no. Like she was having ""relationship chickens""...

But since I had the conversation with my ex-wife, I'm doubting my own analysis of the situation. I looking for any advices on what to do next...

TL;DR : I met a girl that is in a bad relationship. We had feeling for each others. She broke up with the guy 2 times. Calling me back each time. She says she want to leave him... But is not doing it."
Baby daddy hooked up with best friend. Changed my mind about suicide Hey do right now I’m in a hotel room after a long two days. My child’s father is very mean to me constantly called me fat when I was pregnant and put his hands on me. I decided to leave him when I was 3 months pregnant. He no longer was there for me. According to him it was because I didn’t want be with him so he didn’t want to be a father. He’s missed my pregnancy labor and first 5/6 months of my sons life. My son is now almost two. Ever since he came back around he bullies me and disrespects me all the time. He won’t allow me any free time and he said that I’m not allowed to date anyone. I however did date someone but I ended it because I didn’t have enough free time to spend with him and I thought it was unfair. My child’s father has to watch my son two evenings a week while I’m at work. He will not do more than this. Now to the part of him hooping up with my best friend. My best friends son is my god son. Cps took her son away a few weeks ago. During this time she went to a party with my brother and my baby daddy. According to a friend before she arrived he had plotted to try and make a move on her. But when she did arrive they were both equally all over each other. They hooked up in a bed next to my friend who told me this. I heard the story a day and a half ago. This happened about a month ago. Since my friends child was taken I had been checking on her everyday. She never seemed remorseful. She would constantly complain about multiple different guys. When I found out I called my baby daddy and asked if he had to tell me something he said no. I told him what I knew and how hurt I was. He said that I should be okay with it because her body is attractive. (This hurt a lot because she is 240 pounds and I’ve never even been 200 even when pregnant. But he would constantly complain about my weight). He then flipped it on me saying that I can’t date anyone because I feed my son chips and a good mother wouldn’t feed her son chips. I know it doesn’t make sense but that’s what he said. He was also aware that my friend has herpes. He still did not care. I called my old friend afterwards to tell her that we would no longer be friends again I said this in a calm manner. Her response was she did it because I don’t want him anymore so I shouldn’t care. This made things worse because both of them were so cold about it. Anyways I haven’t been able to do anything without bursting into tears. O was supposed to pick my son up from his dad a day and a half ago but I still haven’t gone. While at work today I decided to go home and kill myself. Because I just don’t know who is in my side anymore. I cleaned my home and sent a text to my baby daddy to let him know that I would be killing myself. I then changed my mind about killing myself at home and I went to a hotel. Now after eating and relaxing in such a nice hotel I don’t want to kill myself. My baby daddy never replied to the text and I’m pretty certain I at least want to try living. But I don’t want to have to go near my baby daddy. I need to pick up my son and I would still need him to watch my son twice a week. I don’t really know what to do. The thing that is making me the most depressed is knowing I have to be around him even for a second. I’m genuinely a very happy person. So when I’ve tried to talk to people about it they give me the vibe that they know I’ll get over it. If that makes sense. Not saying they’re dismissive but they just aren’t worried about my being depressed because I usually get over things extremely fast because I prefer to be happy. This is also the first time I’ve ever considered suicide probably why I changed my mind so fast. Again I’m just asking what can I do.
"How do you deal with a partner getting frustrated when you have a bad past and react poorly? Hi I know this probably won't get much traction as this isn't life or death or anything dramatic. 
Let me preface by saying my partner is the most wonderful man and I'm very lucky to have him and this is a question more asking for advice on how I can improve in the relationship. 

So my partner gets frustrated and irritate when things go wrong (image things like recipes not turning out like they should or building IKEA furniture and things aren't going right) and he gets tense and visibly frustrated. He does not swear at me, throw things at me, throw things around me, belittle me or anything bad. My reaction however to his frustration is panicking and tension and wanting to run away. 
My father when I was younger would get like that and then he would start directing his anger at myself, my brother or my mum so I know WHERE the reaction comes from but I don't know how to fix it. I've tried talking to my partner about it and he doesn't seem bothered as he's a chill guy who isn't the best at talking emotionally (more the hug you in silence kind of guy if you're upset and get you snacks) but I feel bad as I don't want to react to him as if he's my abusive father. 

Does anyone have any advice as I can't afford therapy or anything of that matter and I don't want my past to haunt what is the best thing that's ever happened to me. 

Thank you in advance as I know this is very small in comparisons to the other issues that get bought up here."
"I (24F) Have lost interest in my long distant partner (24M) and it feels more like a friendship. Is it worth trying to fix it? I am dating the most amazing and kindest man for the last 2 years. We have recently become long distance and he will be applying to a job near me next year to live together. The last 6 months I’ve been having doubts on and off. 
These doubts are very superficial, I am starting to think I can do better looks wise and don’t feel that attracted to him. I know this sounds big headed but I have always knows looks wise I am better looking but that didn’t really bother me until 6 months ago. I am not interested in sex as much as before, which feels unusual for me. I know looks aren’t everything and they fade but I do feel like I’m missing out and get jealous of my friends when they have attractive boyfriends. I also find that he hasn’t got the same drive when it comes to work or even organising dates and it’s usually me which has to do this. But since I’ve been having doubts and I’ve put little effort into dates nothing has really happened. 
There has never been much passion in the relationship since we started as friends first. Which I do love that it’s chill but compared to previous relationships almost feels too relaxed.
Other than that we get in very well, I know he will be an amazing husband and even greater father and he has been my emotional rock and I haven’t felt so emotional stable until I started dating him.
I’m not sure if I’m settling especially at this young age or if I’m just being superficial and this is just a phase because of the change of becoming long distance and starting a new job.

Unsure while I’m starting the beginning of my career that I should put in effort to work on the relationship or call quits while we are still young.
I’m just so worried if I break up I’ll regret it."
"He said “I love you” super early So I (20F) met this guy (20M) on the internet about a month ago. We’ve hung out about five times and FaceTimed a bunch more. He’s great and I really like him. It’s a relationship that I can actually see going somewhere. The only thing is that earlier today, I met up with him and he said that he loved me. It took me by surprise since I don’t think that we know each other very well.

Is this a red flag? Or is it maybe a good thing?"
broke up with bf of 3 years and im struggling to cope hello everyone. Im 18 years old and i broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years 2 days ago. He pretty much told me he was bored of me and i noticed. He wanted to work it out but i just don’t see how u could fix that i did everything for him. I regretted it right after i broke up with him. I was pissed because he was quick to remove me from all his social media. I cussed him out pretty bad and I regretted it as well so the next day i tried to fix us i loved him so i was willing to do anything to fix it he rejected me and said its best to be friends and that he needs space. He has cheated on me before and we got through that. He didn’t even try to fix it so it makes me think he had found someone else and didn’t want to tell me and I’m heartbroken! I try to be strong but all the memories keep haunting me. Im having a hard time eating and sleeping and i just need some positive words to help me get through this i want to move on and be happy because i know i deserve better. Anything POSITIVE helps thank you.
"How can my fiancée and I celebrate our anniversary in quarantine? Budget isn’t too much of an issue. Any unique ideas, paid or free, are welcomed. We are open to all ideas. I am 26M and she is 26F"
"Partner can't have sex with me A while ago I started going out with my current partner and she told me that she would be ready for sex in a while and couldn't do it until she gets past her trauma. I tried to help her move past it for a long time and she told me it was getting better but a couple of days ago she said that she was lying to me and it hasn't gotten better at all and she doubts it ever will. I don't want to abandon her because I still have feelings for her and I don't think it would be wrong for me to even say I love her. It's just hard to have a relationship which isn't sexual at all and it was a pretty bug let down to hear. I don't know what to do now because it feels like a big hope I had for the future of our relationship was crushed... I really love her but I'm not sure what to do. I noticed about a month ago she started getting awkward around me, and she won't let me do anything remotely intimate but she never wanted to talk about it... I'm confused as to what to do from this. I'd really appreciate any advice

I hope this doesn't get lost in new"
"The guy (19M) I’m (21F) dating hasn’t been very physical with my recently So I’ve been dating this dude since late February/early March. In the beginning it was great, he was all romantic and there was lots of making out and fooling around. We haven’t had sex yet because he’s a virgin and he says he doesn’t feel ready and that’s 100% fine and not the problem. He’s in a 1 year program at my drama school and I’m in one of the BA programs so he’s currently waiting for results on whether he got accepted for a BA course. 
The whole drama school audition process is super stressful and with the added stress of the whole pandemic that can be a lot. 
So I’m staying at his house with his parents and I’ve been here three weeks and we’ve only fooled around twice with only a tiny bit of making out. I asked him about it and he said it was nothing I was doing wrong but that he was too stressed and didn’t have the urge. But we cuddle all the time and he pulls me on top of him and we kiss a bit so I get all excited and he always has a boner but then he’ll get up and start doing something else. 
I get where he’s coming from but I’ve got a pretty high sex drive so physically, I’m getting pretty frustrated. 
That and we’re not officially boyfriend and girlfriend because he says he’s not in a place where he can make that decision because he doesn’t know where he’ll be for school next year or if he gets into a drama school at all. 
Idk what to do? Should I try to initiate fooling around more? I don’t wanna make him uncomfortable though"
"My freind get mad really quik, Like 0 to a 100 in a second We where playing this game and we where joking around. He said he had to go offline, since he had had plans with some freinds. 
i said it was a bad excuse, and then he answered back in fun, saying that it was just cus i didnt have any freinds. I jabbed back for fun saying (you dont have freinds, you just hang out with your brothers freinds) then he got really mad and super personal. 
telling me i didnt do shit with my life and nobody wants to hang out with me... 
This happens aaaall the time... Either he has the biggest ego i have ever seen, or he dosnt have any self ironi. Dont know what to do about it. One time, i didnt talk to him in a year, and he came crawling back. 
Now he is starting to do the same shit again..... Might just call it a past friendship and move on. The only Thing is that, if im cutting him of, im cutting off everyone in my circle since, He Will tell the others to choose me or him, Like a 5 year old kid. I know for a fact he Will do this. I Dont know How to deal with him"
"Think I’m losing a lot of respect for my friend We used to be more than friends but haven’t been for alittle while now cus she ended up sleeping with her ex. But now we’re in a weird phase and I really don’t know what we are. But anyways she was talking about whether or not she wants kids and how she’s just doesn’t know anymore cus “what if the kid turns out ugly”. There were other reasons too but that really got to me, Idk how you can put ugly and disabled or Down syndrome in the same category. I’ve been slowly losing a lot of respect of her for awhile now. The way she talks about how she doesn’t need to justify sleeping with her ex and how she sends nudes to more dudes than I can count, and yes I know we’re not together but it’s just my opinion, she has videos on pornhub that she didn’t know about cus she didn’t know he was filming but she kinda just shrugged it off, not really caring, and all the other stuff she does. I love her but idk, she’s not the person I thought I knew."
"My boyfriend of 2 years wants to take a break, and it came out of nowhere my boyfriend and i had been having an amazing time over the last few months, and we even had an incredible last few days together before the quarantine happened. 

for spring break we spent 2 days together and had our first sleepovers. and then the quarantine happened. my birthday was 3 days after spring break, and he sent me a very loving message and apologized for not being able to be with me on my special day. 

then, three days later, he told me he wanted to take a break from our relationship. it absolutely came out of nowhere for me. i felt like we were in a good place, and we would be ok not seeing each other due to the quarantine. but he said he needed to be by himself and he needed time to think. he told me he isn't happy in our relationship, but that he's in love with me and still loves me. i didn't understand how he could be in love with me but also want to not be with me. we decided to go on a break because i wanted him to be happy, and i was hopeful that we'd come back together. we also decided to keep our break a secret so that no one would be asking questions or assume we broke up, and said we would remain exclusive to each other.

the next few weeks i was a mess. he wouldn't message me, he didn't call, and he would be online and talking to/hanging out with other people, including other girls, alone. 
i'd go a few days without texting him a lot, then break down at night and call him crying because i didn't understand what i did wrong and why it feels like he doesn't care about me anymore. it hurts me so much to hear my parents ask ""how's your boyfriend?"" because i truly don't know anymore. and i can't say anything about it otherwise it will raise suspicion.

one night i called him bawling because he seemed so fine without me in his life. i told him that i had no one to go to because i was struggling so hard with not being with him, as i had no one to talk to since i don't want my friends to know we're on a break. i told him i felt so alone and unwanted, like i don't even matter to him. i see him playing video games with his friends all day, and through the night, while i'm all alone and needing someone to comfort me. it feels like he doesn't love me. i also worry that he's developed feelings for another girl, because he hung out with her alone a few days after we decided to go on a break, and texts her a lot, and he plays video games with her and chats on discord all night. 

i asked if we should just break up, but he doesn't want that.

i feel so pathetic and desperate. i don't know what i did wrong. and he says i did nothing wrong, but i feel like i MUST have because everything felt good, until it just didn't. i feel like i've failed somehow and it's awful because i'm not just losing my boyfriend, i'm losing my best friend.

what should i do? and how can i move forward when i'm basically just waiting for him say we're back together.

(edit) my boyfriend is a senior and this quarantine caused our school year to be cut short. he got robbed of his senior prom, spring musical, graduation, and so much more. his family restaurant got shut down due to covid-19. he's very overwhelmed with what his future is going to look like now. 

i know that he's very overwhelmed but i thought i would be able to be there to support him and help him through this, because i love him and never want to be a hinderance on him. but instead it feels like he just pushed me out of his life, and is carrying on happily without me.


i really feel a sense of worthlessness and like i'm very disposable. i yearn for him, and i have these wonderful dreams about us being together, and i wake up crying because i realize they aren't real. i truly need advice on what to do, since i can't go to any family or friends because this break is a secret. how do i move forward and accept this break?"
"My mom resents other women It’s taken me a while to notice how much my mom resents other women, and how much that rubbed off on me without realizing it. My entire life I’ve been relatively average, bullied in school, etc. Recently, I’ve lost a lot of weight, learned many life-skills (surpassed my mom in cooking, cleaning, academia) and am getting a lot of male attention. This is when our relationship took a turn for the worst. Some background... my mom’s only female friend is a butch lesbian, probably because she isn’t a “threat” to her ego. She’s never gotten along with women really, and she’s always made fun of the wives and mothers in our neighborhood (despite them having many friends, being thinner and prettier, and ultimately minding their business). Does anyone else have any experiences like this? How has it affected your own relationship with women? My mom would always be relatively hostile towards my female friends, and I’m really trying to mitigate the affect it’s had on me. Thoughts?"
"My boyfriend (20M) never texts me and always have to initiate. I talked to him and he says he finds it difficult to initiate but in all honesty how difficult is it to send a ""hey"" or ""sorry I'm busy will talk later"" . we are in an LDR and communication is crucial and we even have a 9 hour time zone difference. I sometimes stay up wanting to talk and he doesn't even inform me before hand If he's busy or can't talk and It's pissing me off now he always tells me last minute and I spend my whole Day as a fool waiting to talk to him. I love him but he just didn't reciprocate. I always have to initiate and even if I send a funny post or a meme he just likes it and doesn't even respond.ik this sounds petty and we even have talked about asking if we want space but that isn't it . all I want is for him to initiate once so I don't think I'm annoying and a pain"
"I(17f) don’t love him(18m) back Ok, so- I’ve been seeing a guy since March and kinda just playing around with a relationship. When we started hanging out I already knew that the relationship had an expiration date (he’s moving away for college in August). So, I didn’t think this would be anything serious. 

Well I guess he thought differently.

Today he told me that he’s in love with me and now I’m freaking out! For starters, this definitely isn’t like, LOVE, and I’m really concerned that he just threw that out there- 
Also, I think I may have responded poorly to it- when he said it, I laughed and said “no you don’t” cause I thought he was joking, but then he was like “No. I love you.” And we were just looking at each other and jesus I don’t know what to do.

I definitely don’t feel the same way about him but I don’t know what to do.. I don’t want to lead him on into thinking there is something more going on but I don’t want to hurt his feelings.
Please help."
My (25F) boyfriend (23M) has porn downloaded on his phone. Should I be worried? I have been in a very loving relationship for about a year now and everything was great. Well I went on his phone the other day and found some BBW porn and he felt really guilty and ashamed about it but i don't know why but I can shake the feeling that he's doing other bad stuff on his phone. He tells me it's not a big deal and that no one else matters but me and that he loves me so much. I don't know if I'm just ovethinking this because my last two relationship ended badly and I was cheated on or its my horrible anxiety and depression just thinking the worst. He is honestly the best guy I have ever been with but should I be worried?
"I think my gf is cheating My girlfriend acts suspicious with her phone, she won’t let me see what she’s doing. And I saw her on Snapchat and she’s like best friends with some guy I saw his bitmoji. And she’s saying he’s her friend and they met in class. Apparently they’re talking a lot if they’re best friends on snap. She always takes her phone to the bathroom too so I can’t look at it. I just feel like something is going on I don’t have a good feeling about this. I told her and she promised there is nothing going on and she wouldn’t cheat but when I asked to see their messages, she said no bc it’s weird and unfair if I read her messages with her friends. Her sex drive has also gone down with me. And she’s always talking to him, on the phone and FaceTime too. I feel ignored"
"Trying to end toxic relationship with my partner, I feel manipulated. I [24F] am trying to end a toxic relationship with my partner [31M]. We have been together for a total of 3 years. Actually, our anniversary would be in a few days. 

We met through friends, dated for a while and then we moved to his country of origin (to Poland) because he got a job offer. 3 months into living together he broke up with me and then changed his mind, in the next years he will do it again and again, saying stuff like: I am the worst that happened to him, I ruined his life, etc... 

He lost his job a year after and I supported him from then forward.
After 2 years I found a good job and just before that he finally broke up with me in the midst of a breakdown. I moved in a new place with my cats and kept distance. We still had the same friends and he moved in with them and they helped him make it through. After a while we could hang out normally like friends. Then one of the friends moved out and he asked me to move in to help with the rent. I agreed due to lager house and space for my cats. Also, I wated to help them. 

Moving there meant the restarting of our relationship, this time he wasn't working but also he didn't look for a job. 

I finally moved out of there and I have my own place. I made it though with financial problems, as we are two people on one salary. He doesn't work, he accuses me constantly of not caring for him a being manipulative and using him. I give him access to my money, he has food, a roof, a bed, clean clothes and all of these just make me feel like he is a child. He is not providing, he tells me I am mean to him and it's costing me my mental health. 

I tried to break up with him but when I do (and I tell him that he can stay as long as he needs to get a job, but respecting some boundaries) he uses suicide against me. He cries and tells me that I am mean, that he is alone and I don't know how to stand it. It works because I do care for him and I get softened... I never broke up with anyone before and I am bad at this. 

Today he ruined a potential meeting I had for an art project I really care about by refusing to help me with a set-up we agreed to a week ago. Please note that I never do anytbing for myself since I work full time job. Then my partner left, not before yelling so close to my face he spit me. The neighbor knock on the door and ask if I am ok, and he asked me to go open if I had the guts. 

He said he is not coming back before leaving... But he left everything else. Didn't take clothes, computer or phone. 

The advice I need is... Do I let him back in? 
And if he doesn't come back, what do I do then?

I am very scared for him. I know he has issues and was just trying to help him... On the other hand, I have been meaning to change my life for the better and I am afraid for myself too. What if I let him back in and this is how the rest of my life is going to be?"
"Guy (24m) and I (22f)have been dating for 2 months and he hides me from his mother? Hi,

So I’ve been seeing a guy for the past 2 months who says he is crazy about me, sees a future with me, wants to be with me etc and says a lot of cute things to me. But he goes out of his way to make sure his mam/family doesn’t know about me. He tells her that he’s with his best friend every time we’re together which is a lot.. I didn’t mind at first because he told me that he is very picky with who he let’s meet his mother and brings to his home which is thought was nice as it shows he’s respectful etc..

But lately it’s just turning me off.. like he goes so far out of his way to make sure she doesn’t know about me. One time his car broke down and he said that if his mam had to come out.. that I would have to go into the supermarket and wander around until she was gone? I find that so odd for someone who claims to be so serious about me. Then another time his best friend called him and said that he had seen her, and that he will make sure she doesn’t see him as she thinks that the guy I’m seeing is with him and not me? So he wouldn’t get caught. He was on this phone call while I was sitting there which just turned me off.

I don’t know, I get not meeting her yet as I wouldn’t even want to, but to be so secretive about it is just so strange for someone that is 24 years old. 

What do you think? Would you be turned off?

Edit; he has told me a few times that he nearly told his mother about me which is cute as means a lot for him, talks about me meeting his family etc and that she’d love me but I just don’t get why I’m being hidden for so long, especially that it’s been 2 months now

Also: I have met his best friend and his best friends girlfriend"
"My (26f) boyfriend (25m) spent $600 from our joint bank account for my birthday and I feel awful about it My boyfriend totally blew my socks off and got two big gifts for my birthday last week that I specifically asked for. I definitely wasn't expecting both, and the specific things I asked for totalled about $200 together. I just learned today when I checked our joint bank account that he actually spent 3x that (the first gift was for the exact same product from a different seller with a huge mark-up, and the second is higher quality).  
   
I am so flattered that he would spend so much on me, but a bit upset and very confused as he took from our savings which are set aside for moving as soon as possible. We aren't tight on money, but our dream of moving is now another month delayed. He knows that I want to move more than I could ever want any gift.  
  
Do I quietly accept them or do I voice my distress?  
  
One more thing; he also spent about $1500 on himself this month for equipment that his work will supply to him for free, he just didn't want to wait for it for his promotion coming in the next couple months. We talked about this several times agreed that if he decided to get his own gear, he would buy a cheap throwaway set for the interim. I don't mind reconsidering our decision, but he quietly made the purchase without talking to me at all."
"My best friends boyfriend threatens me. My (F19) best friends (F19) boyfriend (M21) and I haven't really gotten along since I met him. I found him very egotistical, rude and I overall found his blatant sexual PDA infront of me to be pretty unnecessary and uncomfortable. I'm a straight shooter so I say it how I see it so he doesn't like me either which I'm okay with cause it's not my relationship.

Anyways they are now long distance as of 6 weeks ago to join the Army. Prior to this I helped him with his packing and tried to get along with him as much as possible for her sake and to try and build some sort of small friendship or at least enough that we can stand each other. They were living together cause he had no where else to go and she likes to control her environment so she likes things to be clean and sorted so when he refused to pack his suitcase to leave she became very panicked and upset and he didn't care so I essentially told him to get his shit together and go pack. He told me he ""Feels sorry for my boyfriend"" and that ""I don't know how he can stand you"". I sucked it up and ignored it for her sake.

So now that they are long distance I don't have to really deal with anything more then her telling me about him which is okay. But he called her last night while I was spending the night and when he heard I was there he said that I was Fat and then proceeded to say he would ""Kick my teeth in next time I see you""  for sleeping in the same bed as her which really crossed a line for me. 

I guess what I'm asking is how do I go about dealing with this? I find him to be quite intimidating and it makes me anxious to be around him or hear from him at all but she's my best friend so I guess he kinda comes with her? What do I do?"
"My mother thinks that’s it’s my fault that my dad doesn’t understand nor respect my feelings and opinions because I’m not doing “enough”, I don’t understand what she expects to do or change? She’s always said this every time I talk to my dad. Always something I’m not doing right. So I’ve never had the confidence to share details about this specific part of my life until today. I was so ashamed and embarrassed but now I’ve had enough. There’s so much that’s been done it’s ridiculous and I just want some advice. I hope this isn’t too long. 


Long story short, my parents are separating because my grandmother, Mom’s IN-LAW, has ruined their relationship and got in between them. My dad continues to say that it is my mother who keeps stirring the pot, when REALLY it is my grandmother who has ruined everything. I see it with my own eyes. Why doesn’t he acknowledge what we say? I have no fucking clue. The way how I can explain is that my dad is the type of person that will see my grandmother SPIT in someone’s face but STILL tell you that she never spit in that person’s face. There’s always some reasoning or excuse. He always acts as if his mother can do wrong because she’s “old and ignorant”. I have no relationship with my grandmother even though we live in the house. She will only say one word to me which is “hello” or “good morning” all day. That’s how she treats me. She does not treat me like a real granddaughter. 

So even though I express these concerns to him. He doesn’t believe that it’s MY own opinion, he thinks it is 100% influenced by my mom because of her dislike for my grandma and with that he doesn’t truly believe that I have these feelings. He makes me feel like I can’t think for myself. Even though I am 19. To put it simply, my dad has a narrow minded view of life. He thinks “black and white”. No grey areas. Whenever something or someone disagrees with him, he tries to convince you of his own opinion, some sort of manipulation in a way. He can only see his perspective. So especially when I disagree, he always thinks it’s influenced by someone else.

My mother on the other hand thinks that I’ll be heard if I yell over them, if I “yell harder”, when they scream at each other. She says the reason why I’m not heard by him is because “I’m not angry enough”. I need to get more angry apparently. “You need to go ballistic and lose your shit.” It’s apparently my fault that I’m not being heard by my dad. “I’m too nice” when speaking to him. She actually said that I’m too submissive. You know that’s some BULLshit. I need to curse at my father and “lose my mind” even just to show him a “different side of me” and “maybe he’ll finally get it” she says. THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS LADY. 

She’s forcing me to get to that point because she thinks I might be “heard”. Too submissive? Are you kidding me? Have you forgotten what you AND my dad have pounded in my head for years? I don’t think she understands that for years that’s what I’m taught to do by them. Not to step out of my line and “know my place”. Any serious conversation I have that involves my issues, it would be more than just “disrespectful” if I do the things she’s trying to force me to do right now. Of course, I’m uncomfortable with cursing and going super insane at either of them because I feel like my mom is just saying this shit only because it’s THIS type of situation. Any other situation, it’s always another conversation about respect and what not. And what am I told? Not to be disrespectful and the obvious things u probably wouldn’t be doing to a parent. I remember when having conversations about the sex stuff, me trying to tell them about things that I don’t like that they do, them not giving me privacy, etc. She would always emphasize how disrespectful I sound and I DIDN’T EVEN CURSE but I’m still out of line because of how I react when they get me worked up. How come I couldn’t do what she’s telling me to do now in those other situations? Now it’s different because it’s this mother-in-law situation where NOW she’s like “go ahead, CURSE, do whatever you want because it’s THIS situation and your father needs to fucking understand!” I never got the opportunity to do that when I wanted to discuss my privacy. Hm. Why is it only when it’s a situation that directly affects her?

He’s not gonna hear a damn thing I said. He sure as hell won’t. If anything, I’ll be even MORE unheard. He’s going to say the same shit my mom would say in the past for those other situations. Why? Because that’s the type of person they’ve been teaching me to be since day one. So why would I feel any different in this situation? I’ve been told the same fucking thing in any other situation, so why would I think any different in this situation???

I honestly have no idea what to do."
"My husband (38) and I (27) seem to be compatible with everything except sex. Now I am cheating on him with a guy (34) who seems to be in the same wavelengths with me. I'm sure I will get blasted for this but I am in deep shit right now. My husband and I have been together for almost four years. Everything is going good and we're happy except for one thing; sex. When we started out it was great but about one year into the relationship the sex started to get less and less frequent. Now we only do it like once a week or every two weeks. The worst part is he finishes in like 5 minutes or maybe less, with no foreplay or consideration or a tiny bit of passion at all. I've tried opening up to him about this problem MANY TIMES but he keeps shaking it off and tells me that passion isn't important in a relationship.

Now I met this guy at the gym and we hit it off right away and on god the sex is so mind-blowing, I never knew it could be so much better. Aside from that, we also click and he is willing to be with me. The problem is I don't know how to leave without hurting my children. I love both of them but on different levels. What would you do if you found yourself in the same situation?"
"My (M24) girlfriend (F27) said that if we ever break-up I have to delete all pictures of her My girlfriend of 4 years told me in a bad argument that if we ever break-up, I have to delete all pictures of her.

By pictures of her, I mean every single one that has her face, even if its a together picture. I don't mean any NFSW pictures, as I don't have any.

I personally feel this isn't right as even if we do break-up, I'd still want to keep the memories until I was ready to achieve or delete them. 
She told me that if I didn't delete them and we did indeed break-up there could be legal action as she doesn't give permission for me to keep them... But this doesn't seem right. 

I understand this is probably a red-flag, but I'd like to know what are my rights (UK) for this and what you think and what I could say.

Thanks"
"Help me(28M) get a backbone and dump my terrible boyfriend(38M) who is definitely just using me I (28M) have been with my boyfriend (38M) for about a year and a half. And it's honestly the worst relationship of my life. I am completely convinced he does not care about me at all, and is literally just taking advantage of me. Help me get over the guilt of dumping him.


*Backstory details for context:*


-I am bi, and have dated both genders in the past, my parents are extremely religious and have only ever known my girlfriends. They have no idea I'm dating my boyfriend. [I live far enough away from home they would not be able to just pop in, so this has not been an issue]


-My boyfriend was married previously, and has a 14year old. He lives with his parents(they know about me, and that hes gay) for child support reasons (when he went to work theyd watch him) he claimed this made life easier on his kid, since they then wouldnt have 3 homes.
He had a higher end job, so I assumed he was doing incredibly well financially and had no reason to assume this was a money problem.
He got fired from this job about 6 months into dating, and so he started spending a lot of time at my place. (Hindsight, should have seen all of this as a huge red flag).


*Previous context/examples of troubles:*
-constantly on his phone but will not text or call. He says he wants communication to be in person so it's more genuine and memorable, but he doesnt communicate in person either. He sits in such an awkward silence that it feels like I'd bother him to talk to him. This has created such a problem, and his solution is to hide his read receipts and online status so it looks like hes never on his phone (even though he literally ALWAYS is)
-during his time at my place (unemployed, and he ASSURED me his parents knew and were supportive) we went to his parents for a birthday dinner. His dad asked him how he was getting so many days off, and my boyfriend responded ""just lucky I guess"" meaning he LIED about telling his parents he was fired in the first place when he told me they knew he was fired, and he then gaslight me about ever having those numerous conversations. This also gave me the impression that he was staying at my place to lie about being at work.
-im extremely emotional, he will watch me cry and tell me my feelings are invalid for a list of BS reasons, or see me cry and ignore me completely.
-if I dont initiate conversation with him, he wont talk to me. I can laugh about something on my phone and he wont ask ""what's funny?"" 
Literally I am carrying the entire weight of this relationship and I'm SO over it.

*Current information:*
I have tried breaking up with him so many times, and that's literally the only time he cares about me. He spouts this nonsense that sounds good (example: I wasnt ignoring you, you seemed like you needed space!)

I told him my family was coming to visit me tomorrow for a few days as an excuse to have him get all of his things out of my place ""so my parents dont get suspicious theres actually 2 people living here"" (oh, and did I mention hes never offered to assist with rent, food, or any bills, and complained the one time I asked him to pick up a few groceries while he was out???)

Anyways, hes out. He has his things. This relationship should have ended so long ago it's not even funny.

*what's making me feel guilty:*
When he left he went to a hotel (roughly $70/night) to ""be as far away from his parents as possible to avoid getting them sick"" (when I told him I wanted him to go home to avoid me getting sick he said I was crazy to think I was a higher risk than his parents (gaslighting on 2 levels, as I have a weak immune system, and hes not respecting my rights to my place which I pay for)


*What's stupidly holding me back:*
I suck at making friends, and if I finally successfully dump this guy then I'll be all alone. (And with the virus how am I supposed to meet someone new?)


*Questions: IS IT OK TO JUST GHOST HIM? Like block his number from my phone?
Hes been living with me for almost a year now(does not have a key) hes not on my renters agreement, pays no bills, DO I HAVE ANY LEGAL OBLIGATION to give him time to move out? Or does that not matter because he has all of his things and hasnt paid for anything here?*"
"My girlfriend [F19] wants me [M19] to visit her during quarantine. I am new to this, sorry if I am missing information or my points are unclear, or its to long or short, Language arts is my weak suit.

Background: 

Me and my girlfriend have been together 8 months.  We met in college and ended up both in my house.  Long story short, her mom kicked from her house, then my girlfriend moved in with me around winter break.  After this, we were good overall until the quarantine.  I, being someone who is just starting college, still live with my family.  

My girlfriend and my mom had a disagreement about her going out all the time when a stay at home order passed.  My mom then gave her the choice of stay and stop going out, or move out.  I asked her to stay and just listen to the stay at home.  Her reason to go out she said was church.  Her church is broadcast, but she felt that she did not get the same connection with the broadcast.  I would have been fine with this, except she skipped out on church countless times prior to this, and upon leaving she still early goes because she chose to fill her schedule with work.  I have pushed this down as we are where we are.  

She works as a nurse and is choosing to work over 65 hours a week to keep her from her home.  She is currently in a house being rented to her by her mother.  Her mother is percieved as controlling by both of us, but it seems like she doesnt fight back.  She asked me to stay out of that, so I have tried to best I can.  

Me, I am handling this better than she is based on where I see.  She cant take doing nothing, so she overworked, she is angry about the seperation, and she is super stressed from work.  I am just now hitting my complete melting point of where I feel like I need to have something other than me be my voice of reason.  I would ask those around me, but I already know most of their bias.

Summary: she is an overworked nurse that doesnt have time for anything more than sleep eat work, and has not been handling this situation well.  I am handling it mostly okay, but i have hit a point now.  

My issue: 

She wants me to visit her.  I do not want to disobey the stay at home.  This in itself is a disagreement that I could get over.  My issue is that she keeps taking out her anger that I do not want to disobey the stay at home, she takes that out on me constantly.  I have asked her to stop giving sarcastic ""well you could be here with me"" comments because all its doing is building guilt on my mind that I rationally dont feel like I have earned.  And I cant get rid of this feeling of guilt because she keeps doing it.  I dont have any time to let myself push it away and settle with it being a disagreement.  

I wanted to do bunches of video calls and phone calls, but they keep ending up in fights.  I wanted this so that I could get over our physical distance.  I am pretty sure that it would work for me, but she is making it clear she does not like it.  She will randomly go into bouts where she doesnt want to talk and just ignores me for extended periods.  I have tried pushing these out of my mind, against my ration choice, but it doesnt seem to go well.  Her reasoning is that I am not there.  It keeps coming down to me not being physically there.  

I have hit a breaking point, and suggested that she visit with her distance so we can at least see face to face.  I think this is healthier than many of the quarantine decisions made by either of us.  My issue with that is I fear that afterwards she is going to be even more pissed at how I am not going to her.  

I feel like this has been ranty, but I still dont feel like I have said enough.  I no longer trust my judgement because it keeps seeming to lead to fights.  I guess I want an outside view.  I cant seem to force myself to look at from the outside, or look at it without my own automatic bias.  I want that or I want to ask what ways I can cope with this feeling.  This is my first relationship, and I was never overly emotional with anything prior to this.  I never learned to effectively express my emotions, and it feels like I have fucked up my life just because of this.  

Long story short: She tells ne how I am not there and how pissed at me she is about this.  I asked her what I can do to help her not be pissed at me, and she said I would have to be there.  I really want to be there, but I do not want to go against the stay at home order.  One concrete question I want answered is am I right to be adamant on not going out.  Or am I wrong and i should be with her, consequently disobeying the stay at home"
"My boyfriend put me in the freezer, and I'm going a bit nuts actually Hi people! So I started talking to this guy in November, and we've been going out for about 4 months now. Everything has been really amazing and we have just had the best time while hanging out. The only thing has been that he's been really stressed out about work, and so even though it hasn't really been affecting our relationship, I've been very clear with him that he doesn't have to invite me if he rather pay attention to his work and sort things out there. 

However, a week ago when I was at his place he started to say all these things.. ""I don't know if I might move this summer."" and that he has a feeling that if he does move, we wouldnt last. (should be told that even though he might move to another country, its about 20 minutes away.)
Then he says he doesn't know if he's ready for a relationship (he hasn't been in one since he was 17,and now he's 29). Next things he says is that I'm an obvious choice for a partner and that Im about 90 percent of his joy in life.

Super confusing, for me as for him I'm guessing. Like, everything felt so good, genuin and natural, and all of a sudden he drops these confusing things.
I really get that you can be confused and in need of some time to think, so we decided that he would contact after he gave it a thought and then we would meet and talk about it.

So now I'm currently in the freezer, and this is actually where the problem is. Uptil about Wednesday I could handle it quite fine, it was definitely hard being in a situation where he has every percent of control, letting me out of the freezer since that was the deal. And I can't really work on anything cus I don't know anything, I can't ""go on"" since I don't know if we will continue seeing each other and i can't focus since I also feel a bit hurt actually. I mean, I'm in need of answers which only will flourish from conversations with him, so my thoughts doesn't really get me anywhere. 
(more than whenever not being in control gets to me, and the only way of taking control is to work on not wanting to be with him anymore..)

I'm actually super stressed, I've been doing everything to just keep my life going as usual, reflect on the things that needs reflection and thinking about what I want. But I can't sleep, and I'm starting to feel that I don't really deserve being treated this way (even though this might be a harsh thought and he might not deserve it).

For me, a relationship is something you work on together, and I get that he needs to think about things, but how long does he need for me to not hear from him in order to not be so stressed that he can't sort things out? (I know there's really no answer, but I'm starting to go a bit crazy with this).
It's like, if you need to not talk to your partner for a week in order to not be stressed, then we have a real issue right?

So I really have to keep myself from writing him, saying that I need to meet him, cus even though each day seems to get me further away from seeing myself continue to being with him (since I find this situation really weird and don't really get it), there's still something in me telling me that I should wait for him to reach out, just so I can get the answers that I need.

HELP ME. :( Haha.. I'm losing my reasons.
And I know there's really no questions.. But I'm way to subjective and stressed out to give myself any kind of reasonable advice here."
"A couple in there 40s strangely talked to me. So this was about a couple of years ago and I was 13 at the time. But anyway I was at the movies with my father and during the movie. I went to go get some more snacks and while standing in line a couple that was in front of me turned around. And started complementing me and both of them were about in there 40s and they kept touching my jacket and hoodie and my watch and kept trying to touch my hair and it was all very strange. As they kept calling me very cute and attractive and they asked me what movie I was seeing. But I just ignored basically what they said and walked past them like it never happened and I got my candy and walked back to my movie and never told anyone about it  except now.  I understand that could have been doing this with no creepy intentions at all. But I still think it’s a little strange. Does anyone know what this was about ? 
( Sorry fo the bad grammar I’m typing this on my phone.)"
"When my best friends started dating and ended up fighting with them A year ago, we were like these three musketeers who could spend endless amount of time without getting bored with each other. Fast forward to today, it’s over 4 months that we haven’t spoken to each other.  
It’s so weird for me to adjust to the new equation and how I feel left out every time the three of us are together. IT IS JUST NOT THE SAME. The vibes are different and I just don’t want to be around them anymore. Goddamn honeymoon phase, it’s like i’m not even there. And top of that they have to try to include me. All of this is so unnatural to me.

How should I go about it? I mean they are my friends, it’s not like we are not going to see each other. Help me out"
"I don't think my son [17 M] is mature enough to use the internet without monitoring. I know he's 17 but as long as he lives here he will follow the rules. And in our experience, he isn't mature enough to be on his own without guiding and monitoring, as his autism makes him really socially inept and we don't want him getting into trouble. He tries to hide it all from me but I know everything darling.

I was on his computer watching a soccer game, he has the best bandwidth! And then I notice a minimized chrome tab that pulls up a Twitter page of one of his friends (or, former friends) and a thread of creepy and sexual messages sent to them by my son, which made them cut him off. My son's profile pic and username were censored, but the messages were very sexually graphic in nature and dealt with a lot of specific fetishes and desires I never knew he had. They just proved to me that my son still isn't socially mature and still needs childlike monitoring.

I thought I could trust him to use the internet responsibly and not do stuff like this but it turns out he can't, so we're going back to square one. If he wants to act like a child he can be expected to be treated like one. I've restricted and monitored internet access before for stuff like this and I'm gonna do it again.

So I tried to sit down and talk with him but he was having none of it, I told him that if he doesn't sit down and listen then we're taking away his computer and phone entirely, we don't care if he bought them with his own money because we pay for the internet and electricity that goes through it so yes we can take them away. And we told him about what we discovered and how he's not allowed to hide this stuff from us, and now that we've seen it we can't trust him anymore because he's too socially immature and we're going to put parental controls and spyware on his computer. He resisted again and tried to say he's 17 but we countered with that he doesn't act like it, so he'll be treated like a child again. He begrudgingly complied and let us put filters on his devices, but not before asking us to get him into speech therapy. He had a therapist at school he met with once a week and he never listened to her advice, so we don't want to waste money for him not to listen again. Act like a child, get treated like a child.

Just needed to vent a little. We're doing this because we love and care about him.

TL;DR: Found son's creepy and sexual messages, and that he's not socially mature yet, so we're going back to filtering and monitoring his internet."
"I (18M) game 2 times 2 hours a week and my gf(18F) finds it a big deal. Like I stated in the title. I dont know if i'm making too big of a deal of it but I just find the whole situation pretty fucked up. We've tried talking about it but neither of us want to bend.
We have been together for almost 8 months now and before it I gamed every weekend with my friends about 3-4 hours from 9pm-1am. Since we Got together she really wasnt comfortable gaming this much so we came to the agreement we still have today, 2 days for 2 hours. Now about 3 weeks ago I gamed about half an hour over my 2 hours and she was VERY Mad. And that was an understatement. She said that those 2 hours she had to be alone where so hard for her because she cant do anything and doesn't know anything TO do. Ive tried everything. Staying she could sleep, make puzzels, read, try to join us. Nothing is good, its always something. Either shes doesnt want to mis the hour we chat after I game, she cant stop making the puzzle after the 2 hours, says she only Reads when its daytime or says shes uncormfortable around my friends. Now, I understand the points she makes. The frustrating thing is, she REFUSES to look for something to do to full the 2 hours. Last week she said she will just cry until i Come back because she doesnt have anything else to do which really made me feel bad... 
Tonight, it came to another argument. Last week, she asked for me to just say 'thank you' or something when I return so she feels better. Now since im not used to it, I forgot it the first time. Maybe not the smsrtest thing to do but I legit just forgot it on accident because i honestly just found it really weird. She was pretty Sad saying she 'gives' me something so i have to 'give' her something back. I plain out refused that, saying i Already gave in with her earlier and i didnt think i should give up more of my only hobby.
Now shes Mad and doesnt talk me. I want to make it up buy I dont know if shes ever gonna take my apology

Any Advice?"
"My son is closer to his new step dad than he his to me I married my husband after just 1 and a half years of dating (I know not very long) and it was comforting to know that he and my son  (14)  got on well. 

But now my son is closer to his step dad than me, I birthed him raised him alone and now he's closer to a man that hasn't been in his life very long.

At first it was just sports and things like that, then more personal ""boy stuff"" which I understood why he would go to another guy for that type of thing. But then he told my husband he was gay 3 months before he told me and that hurt. Turns out he tells his step dad a lot of stuff he never bothers to tell me and I'm no longer the first person he talks to in the morning. He asks him for permission for stuff now, and almost exclusively hangs out with him now. I feel like *I'm* the step parent who came into his life not that long ago.

I'm also very surprised my son is already so comfortable with my husband, my mom remarried and it took me years to warm up to my step dad although that might justst be because I felt he was trying to replace my dad whom I still had a great relationship with"
"My (36) gf (25) is annoyed that I want to distance myself from her now that she is returning to work. My gf was recently away from work for about 5 weeks. Today was her first day back. 

She claims she is alone in her part of the facility, but will then share a lunch/breakroom and sit at her own table alone during lunch. She says people come to talk to her, but they stay 6 feet away, and everyone wears masks except the supervisor. Masks come off when eating. There are about a few dozen people at her facility. The other employees seem to be within 6 feet of each other throughout the day.


She has been pushy about the idea that her level of exposure to Coronavirus at work should be deemed safe enough for her and I to continue hanging out. She is angry at me for thinking otherwise. 

Should I hang out with her? Is she right for being angry with me?"
"I tend to distant myself after opening up to people. So I have this pen pal and we emailed each other everyday, and yesterday he shared his really personal thoughts and experience with me, I replied and opened up to him too. I shared my honest thoughts and a quite traumatising past experience. After that I just feel like distancing myself from him, like I’d avoid his email and take time to reply. It’s a really weird feeling, and it happened multiple times. 
Does anyone else feel like this or know why?"
"Inconsistent sex makes me act irrationally I (m28) have had this problem through many relationships and for as long as I can remember. 

I would say I have a higher than average libido and require consistent sex to be satisfied in a relationship. I would probably have sex with my partner (f25) everyday if I could, but usually every other day will do the trick and keep me satisfied enough. 

My partner and I have been dating for a few months now and so far we have had a pretty healthy sex life. We go through stretches where we have sex every time we see each other, which I’d say is the norm for us. But then sometimes she goes through droughts that stretch a few days where she doesn’t want to because she is tired or stressed (which is totally fine, reasonable and normal. If she doesn’t want to, she doesn’t want to and that’s how it should be). 

My problem arises when we start nearing the 6 or 7 day mark of not having had sex. I become anxious, start having irrational doubts that my partner is still into me or attracted to me, and my daily thoughts are consumed by thoughts of sex with her to the point where it’s difficult to enjoy my time with her because I’m waiting for her to get in the mood or to give me a signal that she’s down. It’s frustrating because I know she’s eventually going to have sex again with me when she feels like it, and in all honesty we will probably do it many days in a row again the next time we do, but for whatever reason I can’t get over these feelings of being undesired for this long. 

As I type this, it has been 7 days since we last had sex, and her period is due to start tomorrow. Normally I’m fine not having sex while she’s on her period but knowing that I only have so much time left before another guaranteed few days of no sex exacerbates my negative feelings in this moment almost to the point where I feel resentment that my partner doesn’t want to have sex with me today, especially since she’s kind of already indicated she isn’t feeling like it at the moment. It makes me feel guilty that I feel this way because I’m getting irrationally frustrated with her. 

Of course I’m being irrational because I know she loves me, is attracted to me, and is just stressed out, so sex is the last thing on her mind right now, which is okay and understandable. I just wish I didn’t take it so personally and that it didn’t occupy my mind so heavily. 

Is there anyone that feels the same way as me? What have you done to overcome your feelings? When I was younger I would just jerk off to make me less horny so I could go on with my day and not be obsessed with wanting to have sex with my partner, but as I’ve gotten older it’s become more difficult to perform well if I’ve already cum the same day. So on the off chance she decides to have sex with me later, I’d rather not jerk off beforehand."
"Does this girl have lip fillers/ surgery? I know sometimes it is obvious (e.g. ridiculous lip fillers), but I am taking to a girl who I think Is beautiful and I cant tell if this is natural or if she has had work done. 

I do not mind either way, I am just curious. I am using reddit as I dont want to offend her by straight up asking her."
"My mentally abusive mother is driving me insane So me [18M] has a mother [53F] who has made my life a living hell the last few months....It all seemed to start when I got with my Ex Girlfriend about 8 months ago....she started just going bipolar on me, most of the time she’s usually spewing out bullshit like how I’m a failure compared to my older brother and will not amount to anything. All while I’m in the process of enlisting the US Navy, she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about that either, it’s gotten to the point to when i leave I honestly don’t wanna speak to her again. My ex even almost got into fights with her about her treating me like shit but I told her to not confront her because that would only make the situation worse. 


TLDR, My mom is making my last few months home a living hell...and I don’t know what to do"
"Ex lied about entire relationship I’m feeling very empty and worthless right now and I don’t know what to do.

My ex (F21) and I (M22) broke up two weeks ago because she felt I was mentally abusive. She never previously voiced that in the three years we were together, so I couldn’t have the chance to properly correct my behaviour.

Last week I talked to my doctor and was prescribed anti depressants and I spoke to a therapist who thinks I may be suffering from ptsd and depression. Go figure.

My ex and I agreed to remain friends and check up on each other. That was my first mistake. She continued to tell me she loves me saying I’m handsome yet didn’t want to get back together because she’s worried I’m not going to change.

Today she told me that she never actually loved me throughout the entire relationship.

I feel lied to and deceived. I had pre-existing trust issues stemming from my childhood and it hasn’t gotten better but she was the one I could trust, or so I thought.

Am I being irrational here? I just need some unbiased advice and clarity on my situation...

TL;DR- ex lied about loving me and now I feel lost"
"My boyfriend wants to take a trip with another girl for 3 to 4 months My Boyfriend wants to take a trip with another girl

Hi there, The man I have been dating for 8 months wants to take a 3-4 month roadtrip with another girl. 

 He has had this tripped planned and discussing it with her Since August 20th.They will be sleeping in different tents and going in two separate cars.  

Context on the girl: She is his older sisters best friend, she is well- acquainted with his family and they have known each other for years now, so yes longer than he has known me. I have met the girl(multiple times) and its fine shes cool but I know she knows I am not okay with this even though I have never expressed this to her.

Frankly, he has never asked me if I am okay with this trip and does know I am not okay with, he has let me meet her multiple times and has done a good job in trying to give me security on it. 

The trip was supposed to happen this summer, but Co-vid got in the way. I am selfish but the amount of relief I felt was so necessary, he had a phone call with her and they agreed to do a week-long trip in the fall, but thats to prepare for them to take their 3 month trip next spring in 2021.

He did not ask me at all if I was okay with this and just informed me of their new camping plans on a phone call later that day, I was pissed and angry. 

Should I just give up? Why is he so desperate to take a trip with this other chick? Why can't he find a male to do it with? Please be radically honest with me and tell me what you think.

 Ultimately I don't know how to go about this please give me some perspective,advice or critique."
"My dad (57) wants to divorce ASAP my mom (52) who'd have nowhere to go For backstory I (20f) have an older sister (23) and a younger brother (18), we're from a country in Asia, moved to a country in Europe more than a decade ago. We all live together with our parents.

My mom told me two days ago that my dad met another woman about a year ago (who is living in Asia though) and is currently demanding divorce from my mom. According to my native country's laws both parties have to sign in order for divorce to be finalised, and my dad has almost been harassing her for her to sign, getting crazy angry about it.

They've been fighting since forever and he suddenly started leaving for ""vacations"" last year so it wasn't a shock. Problem is that my mom having quit her job like 20 years ago when she had us kids, she won't be getting any retirement money and she came from a poor background so can't rely on her family, not to mention her siblings would be judgmental for her divorce. But my dad's been telling her to get out of the house, within a few months in the latest, to go back to our native country and live there, because he can't stand living with her. I admit my mom's a very toxic person to be around but my dad definitely hadn't made it easier for them either. Apparently he's told her he'd give her money to live OK for some years, but that would put a financial strain on the rest of us still living here, it's not ideal.

The biggest issue is that my mom is very unstable and fragile, she's a very dependent person and has been a stay at home mom for the past 20 years. Plus with my dad's super stubborn and stoic personality on top of her own childhood trauma my mom barely knows how to be her own person, so she's really scared of being basically kicked out and being alone. She's also not over the shock of learning my dad has been cheating on her, they weren't in love but she still felt betrayed and hurt.

My mom's told my dad she won't stop him from being with the other woman, that she'll sign the papers in a few months, but that she needed to stay with us at least a year or so longer, because she isn't ready to suddenly be out living alone away from her kids, plus it'll destabilise my brother who already has anger issues, and it'd put a financial strain on us. My dad apparently has not been taking it, saying that there's nothing to wait for, that he's made up his mind, that we're old enough to deal with it, and he seems to think she is going to end up refusing to sign the papers if they waited, so he's been persistent about divorcing NOW, of living separately NOW, and that she packs up and leaves home latest in August. He started saying he won't give her any money unless she signs ASAP.

I do think it'd be wise to wait a few months to a year for my mom to digest the situation and come up with what she's going to do alone for the rest of her life, settle on a financial agreement etc., she does have a few friends back in her native country so she won't be absolutely alone, just needs time. But my dad really is stubborn once he's set his mind. Especially in recent years, he's changed from being a super patient person to randomly yelling at strangers when little things went wrong. He's getting old and has his own store of childhood trauma, not an excuse for either of them to be acting like little kids though.

I feel pretty at loss of what to do, I know as the child it's not my job but my parents don't speak the local language nor english very well so they can't go to a counsellor, nor do they want lawyers.

My dad doesn't know that my sister and I know what's going on in between them, my mom's not told him we know. My mom's said I could tell my dad we need her longer, so that he would want her to stay a bit, which would feel pretty weird thing to do ngl. I wish they'd find a compromise on their own, but the stress has been affecting my ability to concentrate on my studies and mental health. I'm studying from home and I can't deal with the bad vibes all around constantly, I'm scared of failing uni. I'm worried for my mom of course, she's not amazing but I don't want her to be kicked out in her state and that would forever change how I see my dad. I'm keeping in mind I've only heard my mom's side.

What can I do in such a situation to help them? Should I even try? Can I tell my mom anything, can I talk to my dad? I heard people can get translators but where do you even call or look for that?

TL;DR My dad has other woman, wants divorce ASAP, but my mom has nowhere to go, no money no self confidence, she can put off signing the papers but the fights are taking a toll on them both.

"I (20F) think I want to break up with my boyfriend (23M) but I'm afraid I will regret it. I have been with my boyfriend for 8 months. It's been kind of a whirlwind thing, never expected to meet him and we fell for each other pretty fast. We've been through a lot together in a very short amount of time. Lately, I've been really feeling like it would be best if we went our separate ways. We see the world very differently and it's caused us to have a lot of fights. He also has lacked empathy with me and others on multiple occasions and I'm a very sensitive person and I feel I may need someone who matches that sensitivity. He also loves to brag and it drives me crazy. I also know I'm very young and I'm afraid to get too involved with him because I don't want to be tied down at this age. But there are many reasons I'm not sure if breaking up with him is the right thing to do.

I'm terrified this is a decision I'm going to regret and I will want him back. Although he has negative traits, we have formed a strong bond over these 8 months. We are able to confide in each other and tell each other everything. We laugh a lot together as well and we do have activities that we both enjoy together. He's also always there to take care of me. I'm afraid I will miss this bond when he's gone and regret breaking up with him. I read somewhere that the key to a happy relationship is a deep friendship between the two of you. I feel we do have that on many levels, but it's hard to overlook the rest. I'm wondering if maybe I'm just taking him for granted and being stupid or selfish. Or maybe this really is the best thing.

I'm sure many people on this subreddit have broken up with someone before. I could use some advice about how to make this decision.

TL;DR: thinking about breaking up with boyfriend of 8 months, but I'm afraid I will regret this decision. Not sure what the best thing to do is"
"still in the courting phase and feel like i’m being BS’ed. should i just move on or stick it out? this guy that has been trying to “talk” to me for about 4 yrs finally wore me down. gave him a chance &amp; the first two weeks were awesome. he’s long distance (3hrs) &amp; said he would drive to see me (ik nobody should be traveling during quarantine but i disgregarded that). then it changed to meeting each other halfway. then it evolved into him wanting me to drive to see him. i’m old fashioned so the fact he’s the guy &amp; offered to come see me first i felt i shouldn’t have to make the drive. 

well that sparked a disagreement &amp; everything went downhill from there. i decided to go cold turkey on him &amp; told him i was done. a day went by &amp; he text me again asking if that was really my final decision . i took that as meaning he really cared &amp; essentially told him we could try again if xyz... it took him TWO days to text back. but in the meantime he had time to  snapchat me a picture of his dick? i told him he was really confusing. he promised he would text back that day. well the NEXT day he sent me a super long text saying the problems were in my head and he’s been fine. he complained that if i don’t hear from him for a day or two i assume the worst. he said it takes days for him to reply because he really puts thought into what he has to say. he also claims to be really busy. granted, he is an up &amp; coming musical artist with a small fan base &amp; has a project coming out very soon that he’s been working on. 

he asked me once he makes it and on a million dollar schedule how will i be able to handle it if i can’t manage it now? i replied to him on wednesday pointing out that barack made time for michelle as president &amp; jayz makes time for beyoncé. he read the text thursday. it is friday &amp; he has yet to reply.... a small part of me feels like i’m being bullshitted.

should i cut him off again? should i stick it out? help!

me: (26F)
him: (26M)

"How to tell my fiance (23m) he stinks? I love my partner. But sometimes he won't bathe for a few days and it gets BAD. He's not essential and has been home  and will now often wear the same clothes for days and not shower. I would typically just be honest with how I feel but his smell is a touchy subject. He was emotionally abused as a kid and because of that he's very sensitive with how he smells to others. I even make a passing comment about how he is getting a bit musky and he starts getting really upset. Its started to effect our sex life as well. I like  foreplay but I can't do it if he's smelling like a highschool locker room. 
I just don't know how to approach the topic."
if you were catcalled or wolf whistled at would you feel angry or flattered? I'd say most females are flattered
"Is a friend's lack of empathy and selfishness enough to end a friendship? I have a friend who wouldn't do anything for anyone unless his actions were directly or indirectly  impacting him  (ie. donate to a food bank, racial/gender inequalities). I think the complete opposite and think its important to speak out and try to help others as much as possible. We've been friends for a couple of years but had never touched on this topic and I don't really know how to deal with my love/appreciation for him conflicting with my values. If anyone has any advice or have dealt with people like this before, please help!"
"Worried my partner is happier without me bit of backstory to this is that I talked to her for a few nights and stuff and she seemed neutral when she was hanging out with me and it's perfectly fine if she is happier and I'm glad she is but I feel like I'm the reason she's not been as happy as she could've been. We didn't talk much today and she came back to me happier than I've seen her in a while and obviously it upset me to think that she is happier without me and that I'm stopping her from being seriously happy. I've asked her before what I do that makes her happy and she replied with ""existing""  which made me worry that she's just being nice.

And I consistently feel like I'm a nuisance to her. I've also been quite upset these past few days which I realise probably didn't help her mood and could've been dragging her down. but this has happened before. She's not been as happy with me as she has with other people and I'm worried shes just getting sick of me. Im just posting this to see if I'm overreacting (I know its something I can do quite often) or if it genuinely seems like I'm the reason shes not happy. We do spend a lot of time together on call because of quarantine and texting at night. And recently I've felt like I'm just annoying her a lot instead of making her happy. I do ask her if I'm annoying her and she tells me no and sometimes says yes, but its fine. I really love her and just want her to be happy and im worried that when shes with me shes not as happy as she can be."

"Got into an argument with my crush My crush and I used to talk to each other a lot. We used to talk on a daily basis, from the moment we got up to the moment we slept. We became really close friends. Funny thing is, my crush knows I like her or that I used to. Before we were really close and just classmates, word got out that I liked her and she found out. I told her that was a thing of the past because I felt that she would avoid me and think that I was a creep. Instead, we actually got really close and talked all the time over the phone and through text etc. My feelings for her grew even stronger.

So onw day we were having a heated discussion about a topic and one thing lead to another. We both said some things that werent said with the intention of hurting one another but in the end they did. Since then we havent talked for 2 months but I really do miss talking to her. 

I want to put everything behind and talk to her again, but I feel that I will look desperate if I talk to her again knowing that she knows that I ""used to"" like her. I'm honestly stuck on what I should do. I thought that I should maybe wait for her birthday and just wish her a happy birthday and hope that everything is ok but that also sounds stupid to me. Her birthday is 2 months away and I cant pretend like nothing happened and that everything is okiedokie. Please help"
Sexuality my boyfriend and I had recently got into an argument because I had saw he was watching trans female porn and i questioned his sexuality kinda in a mean way because we were already arguing. I’m looking for advice on how to apologize. He wants to cut things off. I understand that I invaded his privacy and shouldn’t have questioned it. I don’t care that he was watching it either. I don’t know what to say to him he won’t even talk to me.
"My boyfriend told me he doesn’t like hanging with my friends .... and now I’m freaking out a little bit. This is a red flag, right? 

I mean I don’t particularly like hanging with his friends either. Most of the time they just sit in front of the tv and play games, for hours and hours. And he doesn’t make a huge effort to include me at all. I’m not really that into games, I think they are a bit mind numbing when that’s all you do every single time.
But I always try my best to get to know them and talk to them. I’m just a ball of anxiety, and I don’t feel like they really want to get to know me. 

He told me he feels the same way, but that he doesn’t have any common interests with them and that he feels not included. I have a feeling he’s insecure and thinks they don’t like him. 

This makes sense now though, as I always try to get me and them together with my boyfriend and he always has excuses. I’m actually hurt right now, as my friend and her family really like him. Obviously he doesn’t feel that way.
I voiced my feelings to him, and I said “I feel like you ignore me when you're with your friends. I would at least like you to interact with me more when I’m there.” 

All he had to say was “Don’t know what to tell you. Sorry you don’t have any common interests with what I do with my friends. I don’t want you to feel that way, but Don’t come over if you are going to feel ignored.”

Kind of feels like a punch to the gut. I get playing games is popular with guys, but that’s really all he does. Is this asking too much? 

We then went on to say what we enjoy doing with each other’s friends, which may be a male/female thing. I said I talk about life with them... what our plans are, what’s going on etc. watch movies or play games. 
He said, “I don’t. I just want to sit in front of a screen.” 

I feel stupid for making this post, but anyway, where do I go from here?

Edit: I guess this is more of a stab about me worrying that he is too antisocial for me, as he never really wants to do anything other than play games or play games with his friends. Maybe we need to explore our interests together more."
"My (25/M) girlfriend (23F) and I have been together for 4 years and we are from different countries. Now that we've both graduated I'm not sure if we should stay together. I've been with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. We met on tinder when I was doing a year abroad as part of my undergraduate degree. A few months into us dating I ended things because I did not feel an overwhelming physical attraction to her (I have never told her the truth about this though). That initial breakup only lasted a week or so. There was a definite connection and I didn't want to be so trivial about someone who was so fun to be around so we got back together and I decided it was worth it to give us a serious chance. We fell madly in love and had an amazing first two years together. Some context that might be helpful here is that she was my first girlfriend and the only person who I have had sex with.

When my year abroad ended she decided to do a year abroad where I was studying and that coincided with my final year of university. When I finished my degree I decided to go back for a postgraduate 1 year degree in the city where we had first met and where she was finishing her degree. We moved in together and have been living together for almost 2 years now. 

We were very careful to plan all this in advance so that we could stay together. We were talking about being soul mates and marrying and having kids so it made sense to make these sacrifices to be together. It's also fair to say that those big life events (doing a year abroad, going back for a postgraduate etc.) were also what we wanted for ourselves and our own personal development. We got very lucky with the timing. 

The last year or so has not been so good though. I finished school and started working while waiting for her to finish her degree. I had left my family and friends behind and started to feel like I wasn't really myself any more. The cultural shock had really set in and I felt trapped in this life in a new country and I wasn't very happy. My gf blamed herself for my unhappiness and it was very tough on her as well. She is a very loving and caring person. 

Very recently however, we are talking about me leaving to go back to my country in September and she says she will come and we will just figure it out. But all these old feelings are returning. The physical incompatibility is the main one and I feel so guilty for it. It wasn't an issue for years but all of a sudden it has become such a big one. I often fantasise about meeting new women and I feel terrible for it.  I am not initiating sex like before either. There are also other issues that I have maybe suppressed in the past that are coming to the forefront. I sometimes feel embarrassed by my girlfriend around new people. She can be very messy and clumsy and I am more organised and clean. She will often eat and get food on her face and sometimes hygiene is not a major priority. These things are important to me and I wonder if during the early phases of our relationship I had just looked past them. I realise how insane and petty this must sound but it's been really eating away at me and I don't know if it's a symptom of a larger incompatibility. The idea of marrying her and having children makes me anxious not excited. I have no idea what to do. Our lease expires in August and I have decided I can't abandon her to move out on her own. I am very lost and don't know if anyone has any advice for this kind of thing. I could list a number of other small incompatibilities that are making me question our future but the physical one is the main crux of the issue."
"Before I met my gf (f19) I (m20) sexted and pressured a girl into giving me nudes and now I feel horrible, should I tell my gf what I did? I sexted and pressured a girl into giving me nudes and now I feel horrible

A few months ago I (M20) made an alt account on discord and joined a DDLG server. I befriended a couple of girls, one 18 and one 19. I spoke to other girls but these were the only “serious ones”. 

After a bit of talking and doing DDLG roleplay for a couple of weeks I got them to send me nudes. One was fine with doing it, the other one I had to pressure into it and I feel horrible.

The worst part is they had never seen a picture of me and I was never even attracted to these girls or into DDLG. I was just lonely and wanted someone of the opposite sex to speak too.

After they sent me nudes I thought “Wtf am I doing? I’m roleplaying with random girls online and saying so much weird shit, and getting them to send me nudes. This is gross and not healthy, I’m stopping it” I then deleted all of my messages and my account. 

I now have a girlfriend who I care about and I’m so fucking angry at myself. Why couldn’t I just wait instead of doing desperate shit like that? I can’t imagine what it did to those girl’s self esteem when I instantly ghosted them after they sent me nudes. I feel horrible. 

My girlfriend thinks I’m an angel who can do no wrong, should I tell her what I did just a few months before meeting her? I feel so awful like I’m living a false life not saying who I truly am. I need some advice, please.

Edit: Thanks everyone. I’m probably not going to tell her, I’m going to try and move on. For all the people saying I should apologise to the girl, I wish I could but I deleted everything to do with Discord so I could stay away."
What to do with my girlfriend at this situation. You may all well known about quarantine situation. My girlfriend and me are feeling so apart. But the worst thing is we have a family problem. It seems like her farther and mother dont like me ( or otherwise they do not want to date any of the guy at the moment because of al examination). So they dont allow to use any devices that help her to reach me. I am so hopeless. How can I manage this situation. What can I do
"Am I being too paranoid about my [F21] bf’s [M20] gaming habits? I understand gaming is a good outlet for entertainment and joy right now. I’ve been playing a few games lately but I usually can only play for an hour or two a day before I feel gassed. 

My bf has been playing games for hours. Like 6 hours a day. He does it during work since his work doesn’t require too much interaction with other people or attention atm. 

I was fine with this until we stopped spending time together. A few days ago, he had a break down bc we hadn’t seen each other in 3 months. I had asked him if it would be okay if we could watch a movie together online that night but he said we should wait until the next day and ended up gaming instead. But then the next day came and I was finishing up my last finals, so I was pretty tired that day and asked if he was still up for doing a movie date. He told me he would let me know ASAP but then it became 9:30 pm and then he asked while I was about to fall asleep from waiting. (Keep in mind I was waiting for an answer for like 4 hours) 

And then he never brought it up, so we never did the movie. I asked again yesterday if he’d like to do a movie the next day, but instead he wanted to meet up for a bit in person. (I know, still need to social distance. Dumb on both our parts) 

I agree to it and we met for about an hour today. Last night, I told him and suggested we should meet in the afternoon since I had a goodbye meeting at 11 for work since the semester ended and I just graduated so I won’t be working for the school anymore. Additionally we had both stayed up until 2 am; I was working and he was...playing games. I told him to meet in the afternoon so we could sleep in as he was only getting 5 hours of sleep and I just had a terrible allergy episode yesterday and wanted rest. Yet he insisted we meet at 9 am because he had a lot of school work to catch up on. But during our call today. I noticed he was playing games again. For 6 hours. 
He told me he was going to finish all his work today so he could go hiking this weekend.

I honestly don’t know how to feel. I don’t want to control his time but I feel like I’m just never getting straight answers. If he had told me that he wanted a break from hanging out with me, I would have been fine. Or telling me he wanted to game instead. Noting that last month we had been trying to do activities together for about 2-3 hours everyday or every few days. But I feel uneasy by the fact that he said he had work to do but ended up just gaming more. Idk if he’s just scared to tell me he wants to hang out less or if gaming is becoming an addictive thing? I also hope I’m not just insane to be with...I just graduated (best time to graduate amirite?) and I’m still finding a job, while feeling depressed about all this uncertainty with life atm. 

The other thing is, when he looks back on each day or week, he feels like shit for playing so long. I asked him to please at least try to take a nap or read instead but he says he’ll be fine. 

Should I be concerned about this? 

TLDR; Bfs been gaming a lot and we’re hanging out less. Can’t tell if it’s because of me or if he is getting addicted to gaming. My mind is gonna go poof."
"Jealousy in friendship (long post, but any help would be greatly appreciated, as I’ve been struggling with this nonstop for a year) To preface, I recognize some jealousy is natural.  Skilled masters and celebrities and any awesome person can make me envious at one time or another, but the feeling never lasts more than 10 minutes before I can turn that into admiration. With my friend (we’ll call her Sara) though, crippling feelings of envy overwhelm and eat away at me...every time I think about her.

When we first met freshman yr of uni, we immediately hit it off with similar interests and became the closest to each other. But now that we’re starting to run for positions and pursue opportunities that align with that similar interest, I get so jealous and sad when she achieves them all and I miss most of them... I understand this is mostly hard work, and I try to use her efforts as motivation. However, my insecurities about her superiority have carried over to everything.

I can’t unsee her as being prettier, more talented, smarter, and better than me at everything. People seem to like her more for being nice, but I feel like she’s never nice to me anymore since I became her “friend”. I think I wouldn’t mind her success nearly as much if she just valued me more as a person...

We’re roommates (so I can’t even avoid her when I’m feeling sick of her). I alway ask “how is your day?” and check up on her. And she will talk away about herself but never once ask about me, the entire semester. She even told me she hates hearing people complain so I feel like I cannot confide in her as a friend cause I’m scared she will hate anything I say that’s not related to her... Only once, when I cried, did she listen to me, and then she still made the conversation about herself. I’ve always been there to help her with her problems but I’m exhausted feeling like she loves using me to improve herself but never wants to help me when I need it.

This carries over when we’re talking to groups of our other uni friends. I don’t like interrupting people mid conversation. Multiple times when I’m about to start saying something, she’ll say “oh I just remembered!” So ill wait and try to speak again. Then she’ll interrupt again. Once she interrupted me repeatedly for 6-7 times so I had actually given up talking at that point. Until an angel in the group pointed out that I had been trying to say something for a while and specifically asked for my thought. Sara turned to me surprised and smiled sheepishly but didn’t apologize.

She’s often left me behind to hang out/take pictures with our group of friends and then comes back smiling and talking about it. Once I told her I wish she had brought me over too, and only then did she realize it might have hurt me a bit. She never invited me still, so I’ve learned to find the group myself. But it still hurts when I already see her there,,

She’s admitted that she’s jealous of me for always being so optimistic and nice to others, since I always put on a smile. She also hides things so that she can beat me/take the advantage when I didn’t even want to make it a competition? Once she got so happy that our friend asked for her help and not mine, and she emphasized it a bit too much... She said she’s grateful that I inspired her to apply for all sorts of positions and try her best,,, but now I just feel bitter about it when she excludes me? I think we both dealt with jealousy and while she’s gotten over it, I haven’t.

I’m scared and anxious and exhausted when I’m around her, and now I feel like I cannot be her friend anymore. But she’s also my roommate and I don’t want to worry her if I suddenly stop talking to her. And she’s told me I am her closest friend since high school, and she doesn’t keep in touch with any high school friends anymore. Plus the few times her family has invited me to her house have been so fun cause she’s not stressed about outperforming me like at school, and her mom is the sweetest. But she also gets jealous of me whenever I have really fun conversations with her mom?? Ughh I am always anxious that she’ll get mad at me.

Also now that we’re in quarantine she never texts me back when I text her. Then time will pass and she’ll text me on a completely different topic, expecting an answer, and I’ll give it cause I don’t want her to hate me. I told her she could call me anytime but she hasn’t. That’s fine, but I see her constantly texting our friend group chat. Yet she can never give me the time of day to reply to one of my texts... (I know this must be rly petty, huh...) I’m exhausted with her but I also don’t want her to dislike me even more? I don’t understand these feelings...

I don’t have this problem with any other friend. I’ve been calling my other buddies and having a blast with then, watching shows together and asking about their lives, etc. I feel so uplifted after talking/hanging with them, vs drained when I talk to Sara.

I realize that most of these are probably my fault for being introverted/petty/insecure. Also, I realize that it’s probably all my fault that I feel like our friendship isn’t going the way I want it to. I don’t have a lot of self esteem and get bogged down by jealousy way too easily.

At this point I can’t separate my negativity from her, but we have to be roommates again next year? I don’t know... is there anything I can do about these feelings? Should I try to just think of her as an acquaintance and avoid talking to her when possible? Or should I try to make our friendship work- Even though putting on a fake smile when I feel sad every time I have to talk to her is exhausting... and I’ve tried to bring up these issues multiple times to no avail?"
"I (29M) broke up with my gf (26F) yesterday because she cheated on me two months ago but I still spent the last month having sex with her and now I'm getting shit for it from her friends. What should I do? The title is a mouthful but I'll try to explain it better. I've been dating this girl for 2 years and everything was going great, or at least I thought. Long story short, I found out she was fucking another guy, her grad school peer, for about 2 weeks beginning about 2 months ago backed by solid proof. Lots of it. Anyway I had my moment of shock and anger but for some absurd reason, I didn't see the need to let her know I knew and break up with her right away. I slept on it for 2 days before I realized what I could do instead of just breaking up right then and there.

I want to preface that I had zero intentions of getting ""revenge"" going into this because frankly I don't have time for that shit. But I will say that I 100% understood my motive may have been selfish. With the COVID quarantine going into overdrive around the time I found out my gf cheated, I thought yeah she cheated but we've been fucking this entire time anyway and I'm going to be stuck at home for who knows how long, I will just take this opportunity to have sex with her as much as I can while we're stuck together. It's consensual and the same stuff we've been doing since forever. Well a month of having sex regularly later and with quarantine almost coming to a close, I figured it was a great time to end our thing.

Told her we needed to talk yesterday and basically told her I knew and how. She obviously tried to defend and explain herself and I was being very receptive and nice to her but made it clear it was over. Well she ended up crying to her friends about it and since yesterday, I've been getting messages about how I should reconsider my decision and that I was being ""super disrespectful"" for ""using her for sex"" and haven't once mentioned that her cheating on me was even more disrespectful. We had consensual sex every day for a month and I decided to end it when I wanted to. I don't see an issue with that at all but for some reason, a bunch of my gf's friends do. Should I say my piece now or later or just say fuck it and let it go because its a lost cause? 

TL;DR found out gf cheated a while back. Decided to have sex with her for the past month and then broke up with her yesterday. Now I'm getting shit for it from her friends."
"Toxic Boyfriend [M22] when playing video games [F19] I honestly dont know where to start. We play a video game together and he just gets sooo toxic. He starts yelling at me and blaming me because of minor details in the game. I dont even know how to feel because him being toxic makes me toxic and i start arguing back. Its just fire fighting fire and i dont like this at all. I dont know what to do about this. Its just a game. He gets extremely sad and starts whining because we lose. This is probably one of the most ugly side ive seen of him. A whining toxic child. I myself am toxic too but i know its just a GAME. Should i just ignore him for a while. Its only intense when we play video games. And its also my bad because i fuel his flame by saying that i will play with my guy friends instead. Aside from video games hes a sweet person but i just cant deal with this side of him.

Tldr: i have a toxic boyfriend only when playing video games. He ruins my mood to do anything. He curses, blames, and yells at me for losing games. And this happens every time. how do i deal with this problem"
"How do I [20F] convince my parents [50s M+F] to let me pay my own school loan? So to cut a long story short I come from a large family where academic achievement is the number one priority. For life reasons, my parents never went to college so they wanted their children to have more opportunity.

They worked extremely hard to make sure we could all afford to go to college. (Mom would sometimes be up at 3am to begin work, and not finish until 11pm.)

I realized college was not for me, so I instead chose to go to a trade school and learn a trade. I now do aerospace welding, along with a side hustle, and do very well for myself.

Part of the agreement was my parents would pay for our schooling and loans, with no expectation of paying back. My $5,000 loan was going to start collecting interest in late May, however due to CARES Act it will begin interest and repayment October 1st.

When I mentioned the email stating the loan was in forbearance to my mother, she said ""No, we\[my parents\] will pay the loan on September 15th."" I know she was saying that as my twin is prepping for the MCATs and money is extremely tight due to dad having to stay out of work (In remission from lung cancer, COVID could kill him), and mom's different jobs (independent contract work) being cancelled due to COVID.

However, the future is uncertain and I would like to at least take this burden off her plate. I can easily make the $5,000 to pay the loan in full before it is due, but I don't want to hurt my parents in the process by making them feel they couldn't hold their promises. I also don't want to argue with mom about the money, which will happen if I insist, but if I pay the loan behind their backs it will still hurt their feelings.

How do I go about this to make sure it helps my family?"
"Girls are so confusing I’ve had an on and off relationship with this girl for about 3 years. Currently we’re ‘off’, but because of quarantine we’ve talked a lot more and flirt all the time. I know I still like her and I wanna ask her back out but I don’t want to make the relationship awkward if she says no.
Some days she’ll text me all day, but sometimes she’ll go most of the day ignoring me or not texting me. I don’t usually text her more than like twice without reply, cause I don’t want to seem clingy. 
Just before quarantine she did go out with a guy for a few weeks but it was obvious that she didn’t like him. She said her reason for breaking up with him was that she didn’t want to go out with a guy for at least a month without seeing him (because of quarantine), so I’ve kinda just been waiting until at least end of quarantine to ask her out. Even then I’m not sure if I will ask her out, as most of the times we’ve gone out, she was the one to ask me out, as I got too shy. 
So basically, do I like ask her out now or later or not even at all? Maybe she’ll ask me out if she does actually like me.

Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I think I’m just gonna try to distance myself from her and try to get over her."
"GF personality has changed Me and my gf got together when we were young around 16/17    During childhood I was exposed to more things than her. Like having friends who drunk  liked to go clubbing etc  while her friends were more... well behaved   maybe this is what give me a negative outlook on these things idk, but since then I’ve never had any real desire to go out drinking etc. And up until now I thought that’s something me and my gf could firmly agree on    We were pretty socially introverted. However because she was so sheltered in life she understandably wants to experience these things now she’s of age        

We are now two years on from when we first got together I’m 19 and my gf is 18     Recently she has been making more and more comments about how she wants to go out drinking and clubbing etc she’s been once or twice already    I have no problem with people who do , it’s just not my scene I have bad anxiety and those type of places set me off   Alongside this she has now made clear that she wants to travel to all these exotic countries, up until now I also thought we shared the same travel mindset but that too has obviously changed. ( I’m boring, I know) 

Basically I’m scared that my gf is gonna become tired of my personality   I understand we are young and have to experience these things but I’m just not up for it . How can we maintain a relationship when one of wants to be at home chilling on a Saturday night (me) while the other (her) wants to be hitting all the clubs getting drunk      I’m just fearful that our personalities are increasingly growing apart    Is this sustainable ? I don’t want to lose my gf:( Any advice ?"
"Toxic relationship/in need of encouragement I just broke up and blocked my toxic ex who I dated for 3 years because he doesn’t deserve me. I need someone to tell me they are proud of me because I’m holding back tears right now. 

More info:
He’s a pathological liar and he cheated on me countless amounts of time. I stayed because he told me he would stop. I also stayed because I didn’t think I could ever be treated well. But now I know I deserve better. I deserve the world. I’m sick of having nightmares of him being interested in someone else. I’m sick of him treating me like I wasn’t important. I’m sick of him stringing me along. I’m sick of his lies. Please reach out because my dumb ass might go back to his cheating lying ass for comfort.

How do I not be tempted to unblock him

Update: Thank you to everyone who gave me advice and encouraged me to stay strong. I feel more confident in my decision to no longer give him access to me. I hope this post helps other people like me who are trying to find enough power within to walk away from someone who is constantly draining them everyday. Stay strong my loves."
"M(19) and F(20) I'm stuck with someone I dont feel as though I can spend my life with I've been riding out this relationship because of the relentless pressure of my family and friends to stay with her. We're supposed to be moving in together soon and I have no idea how to rip off the band aid, i do love and care for her but i do not feel as though we're the best for one another. She's left her family and is living in my house and I have such a hard time letting anything go even if I do truly want to be single again I cant do it"
"i like my best friend... who is my ex’s (good terms) twin brother title says it all. i am f16 and they are m17. i ended on really good terms with my ex, and have even spoken to him about this. the problem is, it’s going to be really bad timing. with the quarantine, and him being in grade 12, and school not resuming, i don’t know if i’ll see him as much as before anymore, and i don’t want to start off telling him i like him during quarantine. 

i’ve liked him for a long time on and off. this time it’s a lot stronger though, and i’m not in a relationship with anyone else so i could act on it. 

i just feel bad about his twin brother. it really feels like i’m stepping over a line, even if his brother is okay with it. we didn’t go very far or anything, so that part is okay. it’s just a weird situation for me. 

i’m thinking of telling him every time i talk to him. it’s really hard for me to keep my mouth shut. i just can’t stop thinking about it, and can’t decide whether to just tell him how and see what happens, or to wait for the end of quarantine. 

any advice is welcomed and wanted"
"I [29m] think the girl [26f] I’m dating values work over spending time together. Should I continue to pursue? UPDATE @ 6:54p: just got a text from her... 

“Hey. I know this isnt exactly the message you are looking forward to, but it's definitely needed. You are definitely a really sweet and nice guy, but I realized that I have way too many on my plate right now and I need space. Don't get me wrong, I appreciated everything you've done, but I just need to settle my priorities first and work is one of them. Also, I feel bad and a little suffocated when you ask me when I'm free or that we won't be able to hang out because I picked up shifts. Right now, I'm just trying to work as much as I can before July 1st hits. And it was sweet that you visited and are willing to visit me during my break, but I really wanna take that time to just nap especially with the amount of doubles I'm scheduled to work now. I really wanna apologize, but right now dating is not my priority but I enjoyed the time we had. “

I knew it... I knew what i was doing, and  i know it was wrong... i feel like a fucking idiot. I was little too late asking for advice, but i already knew the answer and i didn’t follow my gut. Ey MODS you can. shut this down now...
————————————————-

I’ve been talking to this girl at my work for like a month or so then we started “dating” maybe for about 3mo. Bad timing with the what’s going on, I know. Things were pretty great IMO initially, talk/txt almost daily and until the late nights, I even come by during her breaks on overnight shifts to cuddle. She expressed that she’s interested in me and vice versa; got into some pretty deep conversations... I’m basically on cloud 9

But in the last mo or so, it died down dramatically. Our work started offering OT during the pandemic so she’s been picking up as much shifts as possible, sometimes 80hrs in 1 wk. I’m always the one initializing the conversation, asking how she’s doing, with not much of a response or replying she’s always tired and apologizes for responding late. I try to setup meeting up, even far in advance but she continues picking up shifts on the weekends. She likes the pay and is trying to max out her vacation hours during the authorized OT period.

I was able to see her a couple times during her breaks, cuddle, and i guess i end up being content for a time... I try expressing for her to communicate but we end up just sleeping during her break

Background wise: i have little dating experience (I’d argue what i have doesn’t count), she does, even further her last relationship was an off and on thing for a couple of years, ended due to lack of communication from the guy.

I think I know what the answer is but just wanted to hear some thoughts: I believe I’m being overly needy, overthinking things, and who am I to deny her wanting to take advantage of the avail OT? I think i might be trying to rush things. But at the same time it makes me a little suspicious that her past relationship ended due to lack of communication from her ex... and if all this OT is making her tired, why keep picking up shifts. Several times i thought about reopening my dating profile and moving on but i talk myself out of that I’m being needy. I think I need to be knocked down a peg i think... But ultimately should I stick with it or move on?

Never been on this subreddit so i apologize if I incorrectly followed the rules"
"How to help partner cope? Due to covid, the two of us are living with my family. We had to move states because we lost our jobs. We’re both on unemployment. I’m handling it pretty well. I don’t mind doing things around the house like gardening, slack lining, cooking, crafting etc... I do miss our old adventurous life of climbing and hiking all the time but I feel very much “it is what it is” I can’t change this situation so I try not to be too upset by it.

My partner on the other hand can’t deal with it. I understand it’s probably a bit harder because he’s here with me and my family but he sometimes gets extremely sad. I’ve tried to offer things he could do to keep occupied but all he wants to do is watch climbing videos. I bought him a skateboard because he likes that and he has hardly touched it. He keeps saying he just wants this pandemic to be over. (I might add he’s a horrible communicator, I have to pry it out of him why he’s acting sad because if I don’t he just mopes around silently) 

I don’t know what to do. I have suggested in a few weeks we buy a used car so we could go for hikes and stuff but he doesn’t want to spend that sort of money, even though we both have it. What can I do to help him cope? I’m tired of him being so sad especially because he doesn’t communicate so it feels directed towards me because he just acts all sad at me instead of expressing himself."
"How do I stay in contact with my gf during quarantine? Ever since quarantine started, it has become more and more difficult to talk to my gf.  We would ordinarily see each other during the school year, but now that classes are online it has become a pain to try to reach her.  Every time I try to reach her to facetime or call, it feels like she's never available.  I honestly feel more lonely than If i wasn't in a relationship.  How do I talk about this to her and improve our connection together?"
"FWB Advice-am I a dick??? Hey guys,

So idk if this is the right subreddit to put this on. But, I was with this guy and we were fwb during the fall semester of college. I had asked him on a few dates-but he said he wasn't ready or didn't want a relationship. We kept sleeping together, and eventually I broke it off because I knew I was developing feelings for him and didn't want to get myself hurt-so I ended things. 

Fast forward two months and out of the blue he texts me apologizing and says a bunch of nice stuff, talking about how kind I was to him during our time together and that he wanted us to be friends. So, I was hesitant but agreed-b/c quarantine and why not? 

About a month or so into us talking again things kind of end up sexual again and we start talking about hanging out again-but in a more romantic sense. He tells me to stop with the romantic stuff so I did. However, he would never text me or message me first (and when we did text it was a bunch of one word replies, and me asking him questions never vice versa-and the only time he would actively text me back is when I would be sexual. Hence why things really even became sexual.

I asked him multiple times if he could text me more, or text me first, and overall communicate more. Each time he said no-and would state his mental health was really bad. Eventually, I ended things because I felt that all we did was argue, or I would be the one to continually double text. However, was I in the wrong during all of this? I'm not sure-I kind of feel like I was a huge douche in regards to his mental health-but also I had expressed back when we were first fwb that I did have romantic feelings towards him and would like to at least go on dates with him...idk I just feel like a tool but also, I don't want to get back together with this person b/c I feel like we don't know how to be nice to one another."
"I can't tell if my boyfriend lied about drinking or not. Me: did you drink a fuckin mickey while you were out?

Him: shakes head

...later

Me: you smell like alcohol. You have been drinking.

Him: nods head

So... he says he thought I said ""did you drink a full mickey"" so he said no. And then when I just said did you drink he said yes. Was this a lie? Because he ""only drank half the mickey""? Or is it a lie by omission because the first time I asked, he didn't say ""No but I drank half of one"". He just simply said no. I'm just confused because he readily admitted it the second time. Is it cause he's drunk?

Reserve the insults or telling me I'm overthinking, just need to know if this was a lie."
"My boyfriend's idea of a threesome Hello reddit! All the people in this post are over 18. 

So basically, yesterday I have been talking with my boyfriend about some kinks he hasn't shared with me. I am a really open person and so is he when it comes about them, but the ones he shared with me this time were quite... embarrassing.  

Some context: A few months ago, after winter had passed, I've made a new friend who is amazing, cute and her body is shaped in the best way. I am bisexual and I found her pretty hot, which my boyfriend is aware of. However, I wouldn't have done anything more with her since I have him. We have talked about going on double dates with her and her boyfriend too, we have planned things, but because of the Coronavirus outbreak we are all stuck at our homes. Everything seemed normal between all of us. 

Back to the story now. My boyfriend told me that he would like it if me and her kissed or did private stuff and he saw that. He also mentioned that he would be fine if me and him were dating but at the same I'd date her and that having/seeing lesbians is every man's dream. He gave me an example for my side, asking me what I would think about seeing him with another hot guy doing intimate stuff. Basically he wanted to justify his.. ""kink"". He is pretty straight and honestly the only intimate thing that could happen with his ass is pegging, but that would come from me, not from any other guy. I asked him if he wanted to have an open relationship (it has been over a year since we got together) but he said he doesn't, at least not if we'd date whoever we wanted because then our relationship would make no sense. So, once again, I don't think he was trying to come out.

It honestly made me sad. He wants that to happen irl and told me we can ""practice"" via roleplaying. This fantasy has been in his mind for months, almost ever since I told him about my friend. It's grossing me out. He said I will always be his number one, but that means that my friend will be number two. I know she would never agree to do such a thing because she has a boyfriend so in the worst case it would be just a double sex date. I voiced my concern to my boyfriend and he said that he loves me and that it was just an idea, not something we must do, that I will always be his only girl and other things to make me feel better. I am afraid that he won't open up to me anymore because of this. I am really kinky but in the past both of us agreed that we won't ever have a threesome or anything like that, that it will be just the two of us, because we are faithful to each other and we wouldn't be able to open up to anyone else. Now this entire wall of promises is broken. I love him but ever since we had that talk I can only think about his words and his idea. I can't get this out of my head and it makes me feel constantly sad.

I don't want to kink shame anyone. Everyone has their own likings. I assume it is my fault because I wanted to know his deepest fantasies. I didn't get mad at him and did not blame anything on him. I kept most of the things from this post to myself and talked to him about how the idea of a threesome would feel for me. I don't want to break up with him. I just want to know how to get over this feeling. I want to cry everytime I think about it. 

So, reddit, how do I get over it? Should I do something more/other than moving on? 

TL;DR: My boyfriend had a fantasy where him, me and my friend are in a threesome and doing intimate things with each other. I don't know how to take that."
"I [25F] finally have a reasonable handle on my anxiety, so I want to try dating (for the first time in my life). The problem? I don't know the first thing about it. I've lived with a debilitating level social anxiety since I can remember. I've barely been able to hold on to what few friendships I have, let alone even *think* about starting a romantic relationship. 

I'm grateful now, through therapy and incredibly supportive friends (I literally owe my life to them), that I'm no longer the painfully awkward, prickly, hair-trigger introvert that I once was. I no longer have panic attacks when people try to hug me, I've finished college, and I've gotten a job that I actually enjoy! Even with the world as crazy &amp; disastrous as it is right now, by some miracle, things are starting to look up for me. 

I feel more confident in myself and my social interactions, so I feel like it's probably about time I take that (admittedly scary) step towards becoming more of a proper adult my age. My issue is that, even though I am definitely better, I have a hard time with new things like this. My knowledge of modern-day courting is exclusively from what rom-coms my friends have made me watch. I'm assuming I should start by downloading a dating app? 

There's no one currently in my life that I would date, so I have to go find someone new. I want to start looking, but I keep get a barrage of questions like: how do dates really work? Where do people go for first dates, besides fancy restaurants? How long should a date last? What's a reasonable time to have between dates? At what point are you actually in a relationship? How much do you share about yourself on a first date? Is there a way to vet out people who might be dangerous? What is considered flirty vs. too far? etc...

Basically, I'm a bit hopeless. I know enough to not expect to meet The One right off the bat, I'm just throwing my hat in the ring (once it's safe to stop social distancing, of course). I'd love to get some advice on literally anything that can help me start my journey. 

Thanks in advance  ❤ 

TL;DR I want to start dating, but have absolutely no clue what I'm doing because I was an anxious mess for the first 25 years of my life. Any advice that could help me get started, even the most basic details, would be much appreciated!"
"My (20F) friend (19F) is going to drop out of college for her 30 year old boyfriend My friend Gigi and I have known each other since high school (we’re currently freshman in college). She dated a guy all throughout high school and they broke up the summer before everybody went to college. Only a few months later she met a guy named John who was her moms coworker. He’s 30 years old.

A lot about their relationship worries me. I’ve brought it up before but she doesn’t want to hear it. What concerns me: he is a recovering alcoholic, recently said he does not enjoy being intimate with her, and when she was sexually assaulted (the first month they were dating) she told him she did not want to have sex for a while but he still begged her constantly every time she saw him until she finally just caved. 

The biggest issue for me however is this: She just informed me that all she wants is to move in with her boyfriend (although he has not asked her or brought it up in anyway, he also has 3 roommates), be his wife and have his children. They’ve been together for 7 months and he hasn’t even told her he loves her yet. She wants to drop out of college to pursue this lifestyle because college is just “too much work.” 

I, of course, told her she was being crazy and that she should focus on just being a young adult for now. She has a lot of potential to do big things when she graduates. She’s saying I would know nothing about what it’s like to be an adult or to date a “mature” man. She has also stopped going out with us to bars and clubs (something she once enjoyed). Our friend group was okay with that bc we didn’t want to force her to do anything but now she doesn’t like hanging out with us as much and says she prefers being around people who are “in sync” with her maturity level. 

I guess what i’m asking is reddit: Am i supposed to support this decision in order to be a good friend? Am I wrong for thinking she is being ridiculous and incredibly immature for thinking a 30 year old is going to settle down with a freshman in college?"
"Me (M34) and my wife (F31) always fight when planning trips. HUGE fights. Help? (Throw away account) I have no idea what causes this or why it’s so consistent. We have been together for twelve years, married for half of it. No kids, no plans to have kids, and we are lucky enough to be able to budget exclusively for traveling. Our relationship is honest and strong, and we are both continually growing individually and together. Once our trips start, we usually have a nice time as our travel styles are similar. But these fights are BAD and like clockwork…

Some additional background: I’ve been with my job for almost 15 years, and I’m very grateful to get over 5 weeks of paid vacation a year. All of it is “use it or lose it” and cycles over each October. I have to coordinate my time off with my coworkers in advance; totally understandable. She has a job that has unlimited time off, as long as it is communicated to her coworkers in advance.

Today’s incident: I had my year of travel organized for the most part, with three weeks set aside for her cousin’s wedding in June, out of state. Plan is to take extra time while we’re out of state &amp; make a vacation out of it. COVID-19 happens and now her wedding is moved to early October. We talk about it, and I tell her I’ll talk to my boss about rescheduling my time off to accommodate. Talk to my boss yesterday, he approves. Before I finalize anything at work, I write down all of my current days off and what I think the new optimal days off would be. Then I provide the sheet to my wife for her thoughts and feedback, which included keeping a week off in early July to use up my PTO suggesting camping (she loves camping). 

She had no plans to travel in June (she has lung disease and is especially cautious about COVID) and we had been openly talking about doing what we can to attend the fall wedding. I communicate multiple times that none of my time off is finalized, that I am willing to compromise on dates, and that my boss is flexible and accommodating. 

She is furious. She keeps saying “How can I commit to this and what if we take time off and have to stay home” or “What about all of the other ideas that we’ve had for trips” or “What about my input and what I want?” It’s as though any potentially unfinished detail is asking her to sacrifice all of her future options. 

The problem is this is cyclical. Every time we plan for a future vacation, any time I try to schedule my PTO before it expires each October, it blows up into screaming, hour-long fights that stretch into days. It’s like I can’t make suggestions without receiving an angry barrage of “What ifs” and “What abouts.” And these aren’t just “hey we didn’t think of this yet so we should probably get it done,” but more along the lines of “this is impossible and I’m offended and I can’t believe you would expect me to sacrifice all of my other future trip ideas.” And they are non-stop, one different issue on top of another. I am incapable of addressing each of her concerns by the time she’s done because I’ve forgotten half of them 30 minutes ago. When I try to address one concern to the next, I get interrupted before I can move on to whatever else was on her list with a new concern. Even if her delivery is off, her concerns are valid, right? I’ve tried writing them down in the moment and that did NOT go well… 

I’m disciplined and responsible. I do the majority of our errands, cooking and cleaning. I spent five years as an event planner and fifteen in media programming (different than my current industry, worked 2+ jobs most my life, just one now), but what I’m saying is I know how to build and execute long term plans; it’s not like I’m a monkey trying to fuck a coconut when it comes to planning a trip. I don’t care so much about where we go or what we do, and I believe I’m always willing to compromise; I just like the time together and I communicate this to her in a positive manner. She loves to travel. As a result of the conflict and that she’s much more passionate about how things happen, the majority of past trips have ended up being planned by her.  She’s simultaneously upset when I contribute to the plans, and also when she “has” to plan everything.

So what am I doing wrong? I speak calmly and softly. I don’t interrupt. I maintain respectful body language. I listen and respond with empathy. I value her opinion and insight. What am I doing that incites this kind of routine aggression? How can I take conversations and brainstorming sessions about our trips and take the teeth out of them? These kinds of conversations should be fun, right? I feel so stumped and defeated"
"My [M26] girlfriend [F22] of 6 months broke up with me during UK Lockdown Hi, apologies in advance for the formatting I am on mobile. 

My girlfriend broke up with me last week in the middle of UK Lockdown. Her reasons were that she doesn’t see a future with me, and that she doesn’t feel like I care enough about her. 

Over the last few months I’ve been struggling a lot, with work, motivation etc. Which has lead her to think that I’ve become lazy. Usually I’m a very active person, I’ll go to the gym 3-4 times a week and play football 3 times a week. 

Lockdown had really got to me and I had lost a lot of motivation up until now. Since the breakup she has asked for some space and I’ve been trying my best to give it to her. I know that she still loves me because she has told me a couple of times this week when I’ve spoken to her, she just can’t see herself with someone who is ‘lazy’. 

This was a massive wake up call for me and I’m now trying to get back on track, I’m going for runs and cycles, tidying up my house etc. All things that she mentioned when she broke up with me.

My struggle is that she said she needs time, and wants to speak when lockdown is over. She’s told me (and a mutual friend) she isn’t giving up on me, but I’m just scared that after all this time apart she will lose her feelings for me. 

Whilst I was struggling I did the stupid thing of not talking to her about it. I tried to block it out and ignore it, I know now that doesn’t work. I have realised a ridiculous amount over this last week, the main thing being I couldn’t show someone else I care, if I don’t truly care for myself. 

Right now, I’m doing everything I can to get myself back where I need to be. So that I can show her who I truly am again and convince her that we do have a future together, like we both believed a few months ago. 

Does anyone have any advice for me dealing with this whilst still respecting her wishes for time and space? It’s already extremely difficult doing this without her with me. But I know I need to do this for myself, and that is because of her. 

Any help will be massively appreciated, I love this woman to bits. I truly hope that I get the opportunity to prove that to her and show her exactly how much I care.

EDIT: apologies for poor wording in some parts, my head is scrambled and my feelings/thoughts are difficult to put into text"
"Umm? Why though My friend wants to show me her man's penis.
Why though?
Does that mean she has seen my man's?"
"Not following my dreams because of relationships Whenever I (21F) get into a serious relationship, I start imagining myself getting married to that person in the future. 

I start trying extremely hard to rescue the relationship for potentially failing, even when it is going amazing. For example, I’ve been dating my current boyfriend for half a year. Everything is going perfect with him, he is very loving, supporting, encouraging. I am in uni and my next year will be my year in the industry. Before meeting him I always wanted to go abroad or just to a different city here. However, once we started dating I kind of stopped looking for jobs abroad, I’d only apply for ones that are local. I applied for some abroad too, but I was quite satisfied when I found out that they did not want to proceed with my application.

So I got a job in the local area, it’s not a well paid job too. I feel like I just sacrificed my dreams for my boyfriend for no reason. It really hurts when my friends got jobs in places all over the world but I’ll be stuck here - by my own decision. I am just so scared that I made the wrong decision that is going to ruin my future career.

How do I stop thinking about my partner as my future husband? It’s not that I want to get married soon, it’s probably because I am scared to end up alone. I’ve not really been single since having my first boyfriend as I would always start dating someone else immediately as my previous relationship fell apart.

How do I start putting myself, my dreams and career first?"
"Breakup Advice So I’ve (M late 20s) been in a “relationship” with this woman (F late 20s) for the past few months and positive she has no interest in me but plays the game since she just wants free stuff.

Since she doesn’t want to see me in person (partly because of social distancing but she has no interest), is it acceptable if I broke up with her over the phone or video chat? I’ll definitely ask if she wants to see my first but if she declines then I’ll just tell her. Otherwise, should I wait until she wants to meet up with me?

Her birthday is coming up in a month and I don’t want the two (breakup and birthday) to be connected. Lastly, I’d rather do this sooner than later.

TL;DR - What’s the best way to breakup with her since she doesn’t want to see me?"
"Found a video of my GF on a porn site. Should I tell her? As I was looking for some “relax time” I searched the type of women I’d like to see And long and behold, I found a homemade video of my GF masturbating.  The vid is about 5 years old from the description and this is way before we were together.  

Im really torn here because I have done some silly things in my past and have sent videos to previous lovers so I’m not mad or think she’s a freak, I just don’t know how to handle this... Do I tell her?   Will this destroy us as a couple and her as a person.

Im not sure what I’d gain from telling her and I’m truly confused, stressed, sad and even worried.

What to do?"
"I fucked up Hey so I haven't used this place at all but I really fucked up today, so basically I was with this girl for like 7 months and we broke up to make a long story short. But today she messaged me asking if I wanted to hang out as friends. I was having a bad day due to other things that are not important to the story. Being lonely and just wanting to do something I said yes, I ended up sleeping with her agian. She went home and hours later I got a text form her saying that she regret it. I did too, I told her I didn't want to talk to her anymore and I feel bad for taking advantage of her. And now she's sending me pictures and pictures of her crying. basically I feel terrible"
"I (22m) really like this girl(18f) but she has a crazy ex I feel for. So I started working with this girl and I thought she was pretty cute and I flirted but nothing consider ""hitting on her"" . It was all in good fun. Then I found out she was in a relationship for 3 years with this guy that she wasn't happy in. At this point we both were friends but we didn't take it outside of work. 

I'm in College and spring break was coming up and I got my hands on LSD and I casually invited her to come take it in a cabin. I was thinking she wouldn't come because I invited her without actually getting her contact information so there's no way she could come because she couldn't message me. Later that night she added me on Insta and messaged me asked for my snap. She really wanted to come. She ended up not coming but we started talking because the virus started and we lost our jobs. 

After talking for 21 days on snap constantly.  She broke up with her boyfriend. I wasn't trying to convince her to do that but she did. Well it's day 51 now and we are back at work and we finally started hanging out after work. 

They have been broken up for about a month at this point and this guy has went completely psycho he's like constantly messaging her everyday. He got his mom to message her and they all low key bash her for breaking up with him and he says some crazy shit. Like he should have gotten her pregnant so they would still be together and how he took her virginity so everytime she has sex she will think of him. I think that stuff is creepy. He also stalks her at work. So at this point I think it's comical. So I'm not taking it seriously because it's not happening to me. I've never seen the dude or anything. Also no one knows we are hanging out other than the people at work.

Last night we were hanging out after work and we drove by her house and he was sitting in the drive way. I was like damn that's creepy. She got mad and was pissed he wouldn't leave her alone because she blocked him. Well we continue hanging out for like 3 hours and we come back up the road where her house is and he is still there. It made me feel like a douchebag. I like this girl but I feel bad for the dude because he's hurting so much and I kinda feel for the guy. Shes also sad because she used to love him but she doesn't see it working out. Basically Im trying to figure out if I should stop talking to this girl for a few months and let stuff heal or I should keep doing what I'm doing even though I feel like a douche.

Edit: Forgot to add that she had been moving on from him for months because they would fight in public and he would embarrass her in front of people. So thats why she was unhappy and she said that he lost interest in her and he wouldn't pay attention. Also that he has no aspirations in life so she can't see a future with him. This is why they broke up."
"My (25F) boyfriend (25M) made a really bad impression when he first met my family. It's been a year and they still hate him. I love my boyfriend, he's very sweet and kind. We will call him Jake. Disclaimer: he still lives with his parents and I live with mine

A year ago, Jake and I started dating and everything was going great. My family seemed to approve, all was well! However, whenever he gets nervous he tends to play ""devil's advocate"" a lot and loves debating on pretty much everything. An example: my mom and sister were discussing celebrity gossip or something in the living room and talked about how they didn't like a certain celebrity.  My boyfriend overheard and started questioning why, defending the actress, on and on. My sister was snarky and told him to stop, so he did. 

His family is rich. He drives a mercedes that his dad bought him and my mom has mentioned to me that Jake thinks he's better than my family and looks down on them. That's not true!! I've never seen an example of him being condescending but my whole family (including dad, mom, two sisters and a BIL) have told me that he's an ass. He's just shy sometimes and can come off as standoffish. I tried explaining that. 

There was an incident where Jake and I went to visit one of my sisters in her home state and we flew over. Sister and BIL let us borrow their new car to drive around for errands etc, and that worked out great for us because we got to explore. When we got home, my sister called me up yelling how we wrecked their car and sent me a picture of a huge dent (like it was made from a pole). I don't ever remember hitting anything! I argued with her, then confront Jake. He admits he did it and was too scared to say anything. He offers to pay for the damage, they give him a bill of a thousand dollars (?!) Outrageous. He gives them $300 and they just let it go thank goodness. 

During a family holiday, Jake wrecks his car for the third time since we started dating (5 months at that point). It was really embarrassing because everyone saw the wreck and Jake's dad had to come and have the car towed. My family called him irresponsible, and they got annoyed because Jake's dad bought him a new car. I don't see an issue with that, his family his money. 

Jake is really sweet, he treats me well, he helps my family with errands and stuff but they still hate him. My sisters hate him so much that we've gotten into yelling matches where they tell me he's a jerk and I can do better. They say he's ugly inside and out. I can't stand it. I'm so sad because I love him and my family is so important to me but they just hate him. What do I do to smooth this over? Will they ever like him?"
"25(F) getting out of an abusive family situation. I feel numb and don’t know where to turn. I am 25, work full time and live at home with my parents, grandmother and younger brother who is 18. I’ve had a very abusive past from my father who began hitting me and being mentally abusive from honestly as long as I can remember. He will choose to be a good dad when he wants to be, until something or someone triggers him again. I just turned 25 last week and a few days ago I had gotten into an argument with my younger brother about his loud noise from playing games till 4 am and I had asked him why he didn’t look like he had slept in days. He began going off on me saying my job was nothing, and that he hated me. The fight escalated, and words were said. 

Two hours later my father comes home, and tells me to give him my phone. I do, and then he slaps me and puts me in a chokehold. He hits me again, and I scream for my mom and he says he will do it again, and kill me. I told my mom to watch the video of him attacking me from our ring camera and she said that basically he was angry and took it out on me. I tell him it’s not ok to hit me and he will never and he said he would knock my head off and do it again. 

On another occasion he threatened to shove a list of ridiculous rules up my ass and said if I wanted to stay here I have to pay rent every week when I’m the only one who works and listing what clothing I was and wasn’t allowed to wear. Certain logos aren’t allowed. It said apologize to everyone for my bad behavior. He beat me and destroyed half of my belongs. No apology there? I have bruises on my neck and arms. He told me in front of my family that I was to be rid of from society and that I was nothing. I wanna kill myself. Now I have to move out and I’m mentally broken from everything. I told him I would call the cops and he said that he dared me. I feel like I’m out of my body ever since he made me feel like he was going to kill me. And that mentioning he would. I have no phone and have to buy new things. That’s replaceable but the trauma is fucking me up. I’m angry because my brother had said things too but my dad has never hit him. Now ever since the fight he will make a point to shove that he loves my brother and not me in my face."
"Comforting words is what I don’t have, I don’t have anyone to talk to really. It would be cool if we could lift each other’s spirits on this. Hey guys, this is my second or third post ever, it’s odd to ask for help, I’ve always been my own therapist and for everyone else, but this rock bottom is not one I can really climb out of alone just yet.

My girlfriend and I broke up two weeks ago and it has affected me a lot, it’s nice to vent even if I’m doing it silently and typing this on Reddit. Shoot this is not my ideal version and I never thought I would have to do this, but I honestly can’t cope.

In my last post here I asked for help regarding my girlfriend, she was acting strange and it turns out she was going through something in her life and it was too much to for her and she said things like “I don’t want to hurt you anymore than I already did” and “if I take too long move on” when she broke up with me, the problem is I don’t know what she is going through. I don’t know if it was me, I feel like a failure because I’m always helping people and the person I loved I could help. 

She blocked me on all social media, I guess she knew I’d try and check up on her and stuff, she knows me well. I don’t know what to do. I was okay at first and I thought I knew it wasn’t all my fault, if at all, she said things like “you’ll forever be my first love” and “you might think there’s someone else [my name] but no, it has always been just you”. Just thinking about that makes my eyes water a bit. 

I guess I just needed to vent, I’m okay with people going over this and thinking it’s lame and stuff, it’s good to vent like this for me. If there’s people who want to say anything or comment on this or bring their situation to light I’d love to help, it takes my mind off of things, and if you’d like to give me some words of advice or something, that would mean a lot to me. I’m a stranger, I know, but honestly we go through some of the same shit sometimes and it’s good to talk about it. 

Thanks for reading guys, I really appreciate it. Hope you have a good day."
"25 [F] Birthdays/Holidays/etc with 25 [M] Don’t use my account much but had to post:

I’ve been with my partner for 4 years ( give or take). In that time frame, we’ve missed spending three of my birthdays together (all unavoidable circumstances from both of us). We’ve been able to get together for all major holidays and all of his birthdays. Growing up, holidays were more low key for him, with his mom decorating and buying all the presents. He sends a present home for his family (we live out of state and can’t always make it) for every holiday he misses, but that’s pretty much all he does. Holidays growing up with me, were a bigger deal and we had parties and everyone exchanged gifts. Now, I don’t have a good home relationship.
I’ve stressed to him multiple times that holidays are a big deal for me (I get really sad because I don’t have any good family relationships). I don’t want to go all out, but I like following small traditions like putting a tree up and exchanging a gift or two. I always make sure to get him stuff he wants, make desserts, and make him feel special. This includes organizing activities. On his birthdays, I’ll make/buy his favorite dessert, get him a fancy dinner, make his favorite meals and make sure we do what he wants. He enjoys that, but he never goes out of his way for my own birthday. 
Today is my birthday and it’s the first we’ve ever gotten to spend together. I’ve been hinting at him buying a dessert I like, but told him I wasn’t picky. I was thinking he’d pick me up something small and meaningful and told him I just wanted to not make any decisions today. However, besides telling me happy birthday, he hasn’t done anything besides that. It kind of makes me feel undervalued, especially since I’ve been working my butt off this past couple months as he’s been unemployed. I work full time, take care of the house and am training for a major event, so it’s been a bit stressful. I just wanted a day of a tiny bit of pampering? I feel like I could be slightly overreacting, since I had a different upbringing. Is there a way to communicate this to him? 
At this point, I feel naggy. 


TL;dr; my partner and I had different upbringings but now it makes me feel slighted on holidays"
"Will I be lonely if I don’t have a romantic relationship with kids and all? If this isn’t the right kind of content for this community then I apologize (I’m new to reddit) and mods please remove this. But if it is then I’d really would need some advice. And I guess I should say I’m on mobile so sorry for formatting, spelling and so on.

Anyways, a little bit of background. I’m a woman in my late 20s, I’ve had a few relationships but never been happy in one and always preferred single life. Not because I wanna sleep around but that I just never actually been in love. My only reason for going into a relationship has always been because it’s kind of expected that I have one.

Anyways I graduated college June last year. All through college I’ve lived on my own, which I have been very happy with, I come from a big family and always had people around me so it was nice having some space to myself. 

But after college I started my own business which was successful enough for me to live comfortably, until Covid hit. I lost a lot of money and couldn’t pay lease on my apartment. So I moved back in with my parents about 1,5 months ago, and I feel so much happier than I’ve done in a long time. I didn’t realize how lonely I actually was before moving in with them again. 

So I guess my problem is that I worry that I’ll never fall in love and never feel like I’ll want a relationship and that I’ll end up completely alone. Like, I don’t even want children! I mean I have really good friends and siblings but everyone are getting married and having children and won’t have time to hang out with me, which is 100% understandable. I’m just scared to be alone.

I recently came across the term aromantic, which I’m a bit scared to look into, because my understanding is that aromantics don’t fall in love? I could be completely wrong, I’m just scared I don’t have the capacity to actually love a person romantically. (I have no problem feeling platonic love or the love you feel for family).

So if anyone have advice on how to, I don’t know, train yourself to want romance and a relationship or have any kind of advice, I’d really appreciate it. I guess I’m just scared to be alone in the future.

Sorry if this seems silly, my sister uses reddit a lot so I just figured I should give it a chance and seek advice here."
My (F) partner lied about a past encounter to me (M) So we’ve been going steady a while and we always tell each other everything. There was always this guy I didn’t like and she was weird about. She cut him off but through rumors someone said she used to mess around with him. She’s denied it countless times but today she came to me and said she had lied to me about it. I really want to forgive her but it’s really hard. I guess just tell me how you feel about it.
"One of my closest friends[16F] of 3-4 years had depression, social anxiety, and an eating disorder. I[15F] love her but it has taken a very large mental toll to be her friend. Background: I've known about her struggles for most of this friendship and have seen her get hospitalized often. She has done a lot of cutting and purging, and sadly she has even tried to kill herself with pills(she has been hospitalized for all of these).I hear about these and I feel bad because I am helpless.

1.I have other friends and I feel like whenever I hang out with them she unintentionally makes me feel guilty. She will say things like ""you have so many other better friends than me"" and ""I'm such a burden compared to your other friends"". I have tried talking to her how that she is not a burden and how she is a good friend but they have not worked.

2.Trying to support her when she is in a time of need is very difficult. I take all advanced classes so I already stay up late with homework but a good number of times I have stayed up very late on school nights trying to support her but failed.

3.Another big thing is that she will say things like ""I don't know what I would do without you"" and ""you are the only person that understands"". This is the biggest reason why our friendship takes such a large mental toll on me. I feel like I have to be there for her and if I'm not and she ends up in the hospital that's on me for not being a good enough of a friend.I'm afraid if I stop being friends with her she will feel abandoned and act upon that feeling.

What do I do in this situation? How can I try to preserve my mental health? Is this a healthy friendship? Is there a way I can communicate to her without making her feel like a burden?"
"How can I (20F) not be crazy? Sorry if this isn't the right place for this and sorry that my post is going to be horribly written.   
Also when I refer to relationships I mean friendships because I've never been in a romantic relationship. 

I don't really know how to describe it except that I don't have any feelings other than hate or love. Obviously for people I don't really know I don't feel hate or love I just feel nothing.  

So, I'll do my best to explain but here is some background on me.   
Throughout middle/highschool I had different friends each year. Sometimes I would go back to old friends or I would just make new friends. The only reason I did this was because I would get bored of being around them. I would still have class with my old friends and I would still get invited to hang out, but I just didn't want to.   
I also am kinda a loner, I prefer to be alone in my dorm/room but I hate to miss out on what my friends are doing.   
I've never spoken with a therapist or anything like that but I think I have social anxiety and/or some form of depression. (I understand that I can't diagnose myself or anything but I feel a lot of the like symptoms of them daily/ every couple days and even if I don't actually have them I relate to parts sorry if this is incorrect of me to say)

Since I've been in college (3 years) I have had the same group of friends and we have all been inseparable. However, I have recognized recently that I either hate or love them at anytime. When things are good I love them and I want to be with them forever, however the second anything goes wrong ( or I think something is wrong) I get so upset I don't want to even be around them. This is also when I get super upset/sad/paranoid. I think they are using me or are making fun of me behind my back. When I go to them to talk about my feelings I think that they are recording me to make fun of later. I know it sounds so stupid but that's what I think. 

I used to think it's just because I am young and I need to mature more but I don't think any of my friends have felt this way. I obviously never say to their face that I hate them because I try to be more mature and I say stuff like when you did this it made me feel this. I don't think they even know I feel this way (and I wont tell them because half the time I know I'm making it up) 

I really want to be a better friend and I keep trying but when I feel paranoid or like I've described I can't make it stop. 

Any advice on anything would be helpful I just want to know some ways to make me a better person."
"Girl (19) I’ve (18) been talking to is so afraid of stepping on my toes that it’s beginning to be a problem Here’s a bit of context. I got led on by my ex, decided I wasn’t gonna date, and then I met this girl by accident. We’ve been talking for a while, though my problem is that she’s high maintenance in a lot of ways I’ve never experienced with other girls. One night I talked about us staying as friends while I figure myself out, and she just cried all night. Another thing is that if I go a while (30 minutes or so) without texting, she apologizes for “bothering” me and it makes me feel like shit. I’ve persisted that I’m not bothered by her texting me, and that I’m just not good at texting. I’ve tried to get the point across to her with subtlety that she needs to tone it down a bit. She just cries every time. Like holy hell, I’m not sure what to do. I’m really trying to be understanding. Maybe I’m just not capable of matching that energy? I’m a laidback person, who just goes with the flow. So it makes me feel like shit when she assumes I don’t want to talk to her after I’ve told her time and time again that it’s not that deep. I don’t even like texting her anymore bc it’s such an effort. We haven’t even started dating yet and this is already just about a dealbreaker, I just feel bad because she seems like she’s really into me, and I don’t want to break something off if it’s salvageable. What do you all think? How can I handle this?"
"My [26 M] Girlfriend [27 F] has broken up with me due to her own issues An overview: 

We had known eachother for about 3 years before we got together, it was unthinkable, neither of us saw it happen. 

She was in a relationship with a friend if mine for roughly 2 years before that and I spoke with him before actually acting on anything. 

It started in December and I ended up, completely off the cuff sending her a message checking up on her since I hadn't seen or heard from her in a few months (we weren't super close)

We ended up going out as friends, shopping, coffee and dog walks it was all good, I can't lie and say I hadn't thought about it but I never intended on actually dating her, roughly a month and a half of speaking she was having a bad time due to one of her friends committing suicide and I asked if she wanted to hang, she agreed and we were watching some TV at my house and smoking weed and letting  loose. 

I started drifting off (rude I know😅) and she kissed me, we never had sex but she did spend the night. It continued, a few days later we did have sex and the next thing we both knew we were in a relationship. 

Everything has been going great, I would spend nights at her house and vice versa not alot changed in our activities, basic couples activities and we had been planning on a potential holiday together in the Winter.

Now we haven't seen eachother in six weeks due to COVID-19 and her being asthmatic, not need to risk other people's lives and potentially our own for our own selfish reasons, right?

Yesterday she sent me a text, a long one. She told me she no longer wanted to be in a relationship... It wasn't me but the fact she can't handle a relationship, she can't process having nice things being said to her and that the relationship was causing a strain on her mental health. She told me she loved me and wanted to still be a close friend of mine.

I'm confused to say the least? She did apologise for doing it over text but didn't want me getting my hopes up coming out of a lockdown just to be shot down.. I understand this, I'd prefer it that way myself if I'm honest and she also told me to video call her as soon as I got the message. I did, we talked, we both cried. I didn't beg her to stay, I told her I'd be there for her and even though I didn't want to call it quits I do respect her position. We are still texting and talking but it's almost like a switch has been flicked. Its.. different, not bad but, different.

I'm not really after relationship advice asking how I can get her back.. it's not my place to chase her and try convince her to stay.. it's not good for either of us especially when it comes to moving on..

I would say it's more a question of; has anyone else had a similar thing happen? How did you deal with it? Did being friends work? Did it get weird?"
Is forgetting when your boyfriend gets out of work a crime? Im trying to be rational about this but dont know how to react. I accidentally forgot the time my bf said he would be home from work. We live apart and he works away for the whole week and comes home at different times every week. He says It shows I dont care about him and that I dont want to see him? *it was 6:30 he came home and I thought it was 7:30* He didn't call to let me know he was home but just waited and then got mad. I told him I was sorry for forgetting but he could have texted or called. I also let him know its hurtful to be accused of not caring about him. Im confused!! He told me was irritated because he was hungry and tired but I feel like this is so over board for an honest mistake. Im hurt and feel like shit. Am I just a huge jerk?
"BF and his parent have different values regarding LGBT My boyfriend (M27) and I (F24) had a conversation a few weeks ago about people's labels, and how it's disrespectful to constantly want to know people's sexuality or gender just because it may not be ""the norm."" When we watch a show with someone who's transgender or gay or even a feminine straight male (to list a few examples), it feels like there always has to be a conversation about it. ""Is that a girl or a boy??"" ""Why are those 2 guys holding hands??"" I got mad a few weeks ago because the whole point of the video was a joke about how dogs act yet he's still making it about the two guys holding hands in the video. I told him it feels like he makes a spectacle about people's sexuality and identity and it feels disrespectful to ask questions like that. He said it's because he's genuinely curious but I immediately told him that his tone voice and body language are judgmental and disrespectful towards these people who at the end of the day are JUST PEOPLE. Well tonight we were watching a show with a transgender woman and my boyfriend initiates the question ""Is that a boy or a girl???"" His dad chimed in too, and it felt as though they were alienating this women. ""A girl?? A boy?? A boy toy?"" his dad joked. I felt so uncomfortable and was shocked that my message wasn't clear enough the first time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know his parents have raised him to be this way, but it seriously bothers me that we can't just watch a show with an LGBTQ+ person where we don't have a mocking conversation about it. What do I do, what's the right thing to say? 

TLDR; my boyfriend and his family alienate LGBTQ+ people in TV shows and it's disrespectful and shouldn't matter."
"This is my 1st ever post. My(23M) GF(20F) is a social media(IG) addict and derives her happiness from posting almost anything and everything on her stories and posts. I'm completely detached from keeping up an online persona &amp; gave up all social media except Facebook only coz i get my work updates. (5 mins read)

I've been in a committed and sincere relationship for 3.5 years with my high school sweetheart, got cheated on, broke up, was depressed for a year, finally moved on and now it's been almost 18 months since I've been in a serious relationship again with this girl (current GF). I took my time to commit after a brutal heartbreak. Educated myself a lot on spirituality and just accepting the chaos and to live with it. It was my rebirth in a lot of ways and i detached myself from a lot of trivial things like social media presence, not spending my energy or time in places or on people i dont resonate with. I just stopped caring about a lot of things. 

Then came this girl who was just 18 and i was 21(and in depression) when we met. She's a hyper extrovert and I'm literally the opposite. She's had several 'no strings attached' relationships with quite a few guys by the time i met her and turns out most of the people were somehow my ex-batchmates or seniors from school or closely associated mutuals, but, she never had a serious boyfriend or a committed relationship before me with any of them. I'm her first love and after that she's been loyal to me till date and we've been happy. but it puts me in some uncomfortable situations from time to time when i have to face some guys from her past. 

She had this huge IG following as close to 7k followers (which she was massively proud and happy about, but she hardly has like 5 real friends). She eventually got rid of almost 5-6k followers as it was an open profile and there was a lot of noise flowing into the relationship. being an underaged girl, She was going out almost every weekend to clubs with the wrong crowd previously and attracted a lot of unwanted attention. she seemed to have had a liking for it. After we started dating we went together but the frequency has gone down coz i dont enjoy going out much. so this started into a topic for her that ""she's changing and she doesn't like it and it doesn't feel like herself"". she says "" im losing the 'real' me who likes to go out and posts pictures on IG and stories"".

whenever i ask her, ""tell me then, who's the real you and why do you think you're not happy letting go of who you really were"", she says ""i don't know and i don't have an answer"". 

I'm a pretty straight forward person when it comes to expressing feelings and i don't seek my happiness digitally creating an extended version of me online. But i have nobody to express my feelings to about this whole thing. I tried talking to her best friend(20F)about it, to which she just says ""she's difficult to deal with"", ""you have to understand her past"", ""you signed up for it"", "" you have to be enthusiastic about her interests"", ""dont have to be proactive in every conversation and try to dominate her, let her do it sometimes"", ""its all out of love for you"", ""she's a girl and that's how it is"", ""she's exploring herself right now, be patient with her"". I understand that i have to be patient and understanding, what I dont understand is if this relationship is the reason for that 'change', so its basically me who's stopping her from many things she wants to do and eventually making her sad.

Im just confused as to how to deal with this situation and i could talk to nobody, so this is my last resort. this is my first ever post on Reddit so im not sure if i conveyed my point clearly, but please help me out here and ask me if anything aint clear or needs further information or explanation. I just dont want to be broken again."
"ThrowRA my (16) gf (15) broke up with me recently and her best friend (15) and me might become FWB, is this a good idea, and got any advice on how to make it work? Okay so this will need some slight explanation, she broke up after several months because I just wasn’t “it” we’re trying to stay friends but in my eyes that’s not really working. I’ve been feeling really lonely lately. Her best friend also broke up recently and has been feeling the same way. So we thought why not use each other to get rid of that, but we both feel kinda bad about the fact that she’s best friends with my ex, but we’re still thinking about giving it a try. Is this wise by any standard and how should we proceed if we want to make this work?"
"Can’t tell if guy I met online likes me or is just being friendly Hey Reddit. 

I’m sorta not certain of the signals I’m getting from a guy (23) was hoping you guys could help me out. (I’m 21)

So there’s a guy I met online. He’s great and we get along like a house on fire. We haven’t stopped texting since we started talking. We’re just constantly talking to each other. It’s been a few months now that we’ve been speaking. He’s a musician. And he’s in America and I’m in South Africa so we’re in different time zones. We’re both actually from Australia, just currently not in aus but we both plan on being back in aus at the end of the year (for different reasons). 

So yeah I think from us talking all the time I may have developed a tiny crush on him. We have a lot in common and the vibes are just really good. We’re basically on the same wavelength. He’s really sweet and a good listener. We’ve like hardly flirted tho. Very very little. But he keeps telling me he’s never vibed with someone / had so much in common with someone ever and he loves it and that he’s really excited to meet me in person, and that it sucks that we’re so far from each other. (We plan on meeting when we’re back in aus). We haven’t spoken on a call. Just texting. We also have this thing going where if we talk about something to do or a place to eat we say to add it to the list. And the list is essentially a list of things we’re gonna do when we hang out. His friends also know about me. And he has a kid. His kid knows that we speak. He is pretty wary of jumping into things because of his kid. He also says his friends always tease him for constantly being glued to his phone talking to me but he doesn’t care coz he loves speaking to me. He also made me a spotify playlist lol. 

But yeah - I’m generally bad at reading social cues as it is and he isn’t on reddit so I thought I’d ask for some advice on telling me whether he’s just being friendly or not. I don’t want to say anything because realistically we aren’t gonna meet for a few months. And I just don’t wanna ruin whatever we currently have. 

All advice is appreciated. Thank you."
"Should I leave... Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice on how I should proceed with my current situation.

I’ve known my girlfriend for 3yrs and we’ve been dating for 6mos. In our time together I have taken her on a few trips, bought jewelry, a car and provided her with 1k every month to help her out with her bills. However, in all of our time dating she has never really made me feel appreciated or wanted. She makes sex feel like a chore and she’s doing me a favor, our conversation are limited and anytime we talk about world events her first thought is “it’s the Illuminati “. 

As for affection....it’s non existent. She doesn’t hug or kiss me. She never takes the time to consider me and my needs. I’ve told her that I don’t feel that she really likes me and her response was to say that it’s because she’s tired from working. Never mind the fact that she utilized the money that I give her to make up for the days that she calls in (5-6 times per month).

Not that I’m saying that my doing nice things means I expect her to be at my beck and call. However, I wanna know that she’s happy to see me when I visit, or for her to consider me and do some of the small things that I ask for such as cook me a meal (I cook for her regularly) from time to time. Rub my my shoulders every now and then (I massage her feet and body 1-2 times a week).

I don’t want to think of her as being financially motivated but after spending 150k in the last 6mos, I feel like I need to move on and find someone that I feel is actually into me.

It almost feels like she wants me to continue to treat her like a Queen while she never has to really consider me.

FYI, this is NOT a sugar daddy situation (although it feels like it sometimes). I’m just a financially independent man that loves providing for my woman. 

Thanks for your thoughts"
"Do any of you have experience with moving to be with someone in a long distance relationship? This is going to sound really nerdy, but I met this boy while playing league of legends when I was 18 years old. We went through a period where we talked to each other every night before we went to bed. Then we both dated other people for 4 years, and the relationships ended around the same times too. I stopped talking to him during this time, but I would check his Facebook often, just to get a glimpse of his life.  I’m now 26, and we are basically exclusive. He sent me really expensive birthday presents while I had a quarantine birthday. He and I truly do seem compatible on so many levels- love languages, food, communication- you name it. He’s coming to see me next week for the first time. 

I got cheated on and hurt really badly in my last relationship, so I’ve been doing this thing in all of my prospective relationships since where I try to find flaws or I try to find things to make me not care, but we’re coming to the edge of how much I can control that protective layer, because I really am starting to feel deeply for him. 

He lives in TN and I live in NC. (It’s actually 11 hours because of the geographic locations of our towns even though it seems like it’s not a lot). He has told me that he’s willing to move here, and that it would be totally worth it for him for love and for happiness. I’m a little scared, because I lived with the ex that cheated on me, and we had a place together. I had to move out and I’m in my own place now. If it doesn’t work... That was a traumatic experience, but it would be him and not me this time. I also don’t want his friends and family to resent me for taking him away. I don’t want him to eventually resent me for moving to me. I keep telling him that I would want for that to be his decision. I’m a little inflexible at being able to move- my mother is older and I need to be closer to her in case she needs me- so I can’t make the sacrifices he is making. I might feel a little guilty, but I think I’d really love it if he came here. 

Has anyone actually gone through this? Do you have any pointers or advice or anything that might ease my anxiety? 
I know I’m still very apparently struggling with trust issues, so if anyone has advice on that, I’m open."
"I (26f) told my boyfriend (26m) that my dad sexually abused me growing up. Now i’m second guessing this. How do I talk to him about this? So first of all I just want to clarify a few things, because I know this can be seen as a more sensitive/controversial topic.. I am fully aware of how wrong it is to wrongly accuse someone of sexual abuse. I have never disclosed it to anyone except for a single therapist, my ex, and my current boyfriend. I would never move forward with any accusations based on only a gut feeling, it was moreso something I just needed to explore. Please dont be mean to me, thanks!

 

I suffer from PTSD from my childhood and several relationships that I had in my early 20s. Im not sure how many of you will know what Im talking about, but a lot of people who have suffered trauma as a child know that your brain is pretty good at blocking out traumatic events. A lot of my childhood is just a big blank space. I dont remember a lot of it, I just know feelings. I know that my father did questionable things, and I remember feeling a lot of fear around him, locking myself in my room at night. I also identify with the majority of symptoms of those who have gone through childhood sexual abuse, as defined by my therapist in the past. My therapist and I moved forward with my treatment with the “fact” in mind that I was sexually abused as a child and it did help in my healing, even though I was never able to pinpoint who exactly it was from. 

 

I have been with my boyfriend for about 1.5 years, and while he is a good boyfriend, he is not great with emotions. He can at times be unintentionally insensitive when he doesn’t understand something. When we first started dating and even now I occasionally have flashbacks or really bad feelings when were having sex and we have to stop. Obviously he would wonder what was wrong and the more we talked, I disclosed to him that my father sexually abused me as a child, but I didn’t want to talk about it. We haven’t talked about it since, and this was about a year ago. Since this conversation we took a short break, I went to a mental health facility to get my head straight, and have since been in therapy.

I still cant remember my childhood. I still cant remember what it was that brought on the bad feelings that I have flashbacks to, or what caused them. Like I said, I know I was afraid of my dad, and he did some occasionally questionable things, and that’s why I linked it to him , but now I am feeling guilt because I dont know/don’t think anymore that this was the case. 

I don’t know how to talk about this with my boyfriend. He is not so good with this kind of thing, which honestly I don’t think really anyone would be? Im aware I should have explored deeper into my feelings at the time it came up, but this was hard for me. it’s also hard now that I still don’t know what happened.  Its so delicate, can someone please give me advice?


TL;DR: had gut feeling that my father was sexually abusive growing up, told my boyfriend this a while ago and haven’t talked about it since, now I am questioning myself and my memory."
"How to remind someone without seeming clingy? I sent this guy something I had written to read over. 


We have been familiar and a bit flirty for a while but nothing concrete. 

He said he would love to read it but he had other stuff to work on and that he should get round to it in a week. 

It’s now been almost 2 weeks and no reply. 

I was thinking about liking his latest message, to jolt his memory. 

I don’t want to be a nag that is desperate for an answer. 

Should I just leave it? Any suggestions would be so helpful."
"my abuse story he had the perfect timing.

this guy came into my life about 2 years ago. i had never been in a serious relationship before and he was my first, so i didn’t know any different. it started off with him picking fights with me over stupid stuff, and moved to me not being allowed to talk to other guys, to me not being allowed to hang out with anyone but him. i went with it because i thought i loved him. i put up with this stuff for a while. every time i was ready to up and leave it’s like he somehow knew and he switched up until he knew i’d give him a chance again. he became physically abusive with me for the first time when he called me beautiful one day, and i didn’t say thank you. he got angry because he thought that because he told me every day that i had to believe it. i was in so much shock i didn’t know what to do with myself. i didn’t tell anyone about it. then there was one night where he was at my house, and we had gone downstairs to wait for his ride home, by that time my parents had gone to bed. i was sitting on the counter and he was leaning on the other side, and then there was an incident. now, to cope with stuff like this i usually use humour, i did that for a while and to this day no one knows how much it actually hurt me. of course i left out details where people would see the seriousness of the situation. 

fast forward to a month or two later, i had finally broken up with him. by then he had be feeling disgusted with who i was. it hurt but i knew it was the best thing i could’ve done for myself. he texted me that’s whole morning in class begging me to take him back, and i guess when it finally clicked in his head he got nasty. name calling, excuses, what he was gonna do to me etc. i stood up for myself, there was no way i wouldn’t with the way he was speaking to me. he threatened and talked down on my family. that was the last straw for me i told him if he had such a big issue he needs to take it up with me in person. he threatened to hurt me but i knew him well enough that i knew for sure he wouldn’t lay a hand on me in public. honestly i’d have no problem hitting that man. he was terrible. we were supposed to talk multiple times in person but he never showed up. this went on for a little over a year. it was on and off but we were never “okay”. 

once that ended, i started talking to a new guy. things didn’t work out with him but i am truly grateful for him anyways, i’ll call this one x. x and i had been eying each other for a little bit, we started talking and eventually ended up in a relationship. everything went well at first that is until my anxiety kicked in. it was horrible my guard was always up, he would rarely catch me with it down. i feel terrible for the arguments i started that didn’t even need to be had. we broke up mutually, we had our rocky moments but now we’re good. it took me a little bit but then i realized what the arguments were and why i was so scared all the time. the first relationship i was in was so messy and abusive, and that’s how i thought relationships went at that age. i was always ready to fight. but he helped me realize that because x was a good guy, he didn’t want to harm me in any way and didn’t have any bad intentions. i didn’t either, but i didn’t know that x wouldn’t treat me the same as the other guy did. now i’m in a relationship (with a woman) and i’ve never been in a happier or healthier relationship in my life, we know how to talk thinks out when we argue even though it rarely happens, we communicate properly, and i’ve never been shown proper love like this before. now i know how i’m supposed to be treated. 

i’d like to thank x, for helping me see the damage the other guy caused, causing me to find a way to fix my toxic tendencies. 

i wanna thank my girlfriend, for showing me what love feels like. 

last but not least i’d like to thank the abusive pos for showing me what to look out for in a relationship and not to put up with it."
"Cheated on my girlfriend, but she lives with me Hi all, thanks for taking some time to read this! I’m looking for answers, not judgement 

Me (20m) and my girlfriend (22) have been dating for 6 months. I met her through my best friend, and she is everything I could ever ask for. Me and her both mutually agree we want to grow old together and build a future together. We have been living together for the past 3 months , mostly in part to me wanting to remove her from her abusive dads household. I have helped her get a better job, create better habits, and she has helped me in the same way. I do everything I can to improve her quality of life, and I can’t imagine dating anyone else.

I’ve cheated on her multiple times, with multiple people (people I knew before our relationship). I cheated on her again today, but hadn’t in the past two months beyond that. I am filled with immense guilt and pain in my actions I’ve committed, but there isn’t a way to change what I’ve done. I have had a serious porn addiction for which I try my best to curb and break, but am not able to seek professional help due to lack of money. I can’t control this, my brain goes into an autopilot mode. 

I realize the best course of action would be to break up with her and to not allow her to be around someone who would be as uncaring/out of control in this aspect as I am, but she has no place to move to (abusive family, and no money to afford her own place). I genuinely do not know how to address this in the circumstances, and would love to pay for a new apartment for her, but am unable"
"I’m in love with my bestfriend, I don’t know if i should just let her go 
About a year ago, she and I started seeing each other every afternoon to have a coffee and have a casual conversation and it became like a routine in our lifes, and a few months later I started to feel really good with her becausewe have a lot of things in common and I felt she actually listened everything i had to say and i would listen to her too, like we had a really good connection, she always told me there’s nothing like our friendship and stuff.. we started being so affective and i really got used to being with her, but i never confessed i loved her because i wasn’t so sure if i was and she was struggling a lot with herself, I suspected that she loved me tho and it wasn’t really the time to do it.

Like 6 months later we moved to another city for college and for the first months she would go to my house and i go to her a couple of times a week but it felt it wasn’t the same until one day she came over and told me she was seeing somebody and i listened to her and advice her as always but it really crumbled me down (she didn’t know) and i decided to keep my distance.

But now in quarantine we’re both in our hometown and we’ve started going for coffee again but I’m not sure of what’s going next, i still feel something for her but i really don’t know if i should just let her go.

(Sorry for the english i’m not a native speaker but i did my best)"
"Should I [F21] let my boyfriend [M22] still be friends with his ex boyfriend [M26]?? So. Let me preface this with by saying that my boyfriend (alias: Cesar)  is the sweetest and loyalist guy ever but I can’t seem to shake that there’s some hypocrisy happening here. Cesar gets jealous at shit easily. I’m talking furious- not at me- but the other person FURIOUS. He’s come back home before in a mood that my friends- guys and girls alike (although I’m straight)- were being too jokingly chummy with me. Now, you can see why I would be puzzled that he nonchalantly attempted to nudge me and his ex boyfriend (let’s call him Chris) to be friends. 
Chris is okay from what I heard. Effeminate and boring if anything but what rubs me the wrong way is that the day after Cesar and I began dating, Chris asked him to rekindle their relationship that’s been 2 years dead. Being a girl dating  a gay-leaning bisexual guy has its own sudden set of mixed emotions but knowing his ex boyfriend is still in the picture and has feelings for him just rubs me the wrong way, no matter HOW platonic their relationship is now. 

What I’m asking here is: should I ask him to cease communication with Chris. I don’t want to be the over dramatic and clingy gf but still...I feel helpless. 

TLDR: My boyfriend is still best friends with his ex boyfriend and I’m unsure if I should be okay with that. Help me out here!"
"Loving someone different I met a guy online and I fell in love with him. The problem is that we are from different backgrounds ( I am Middle Eastern, he is Brazilian) he doesn’t follow a religion while I do plus he is 8 year older than me. He will visit me within 2 years (due to covid-19) he told me once that he “admires me” and he reacts and replies to my stories on insta and seems to care about me.. but he stopped out of the sudden..(he didn’t say it straight forward that I’m more than friend) what can I do? Should I forget him? What does that silence mean?"
"Does the fact that my partner and I can't stand each other during quarantine mean that we should break up? We have been living in a 322 square feet (30 square meters) studio/ student dorm room for the past year, been together almost 2. 

The fact that I'm always present is making him sick of me. This causes him to be resentful towards me, and he doesn't want to plan any romantic activities with me, which is my main love language. Not only does he not show any excitement when seeing me/being with me, he keeps gaming day and night. This is making me feel unloved, which makes me feel miserable, which makes me not want to be physically intimate, which is his main love language. So, we're both so miserable that we started calling each other nasty names and basically created a hate-love towards each other. This has led to me planning on moving back to my toxic parents' home on next Monday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do have to mention that only he pays for rent. The money for this rent comes from his study loans, which his country offers to any college student (he is an international student studying in my country. He's from the neighbouring country, which is a 1 hour drive from here). After college, he will have to pay back about 30 euro per month for this. Yes, this does make me feel guilty. I try to pay half of the big water/electricity bill that comes once a year. I honestly would pay half of the rent, but my country does not offer a student loan, so I don't have money like he does. On one side it's bad for our relationship and on the other side, it's honestly unfair to him for me to keep living here for free. He's pretty much ecstatic about me moving out.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, I'm afraid that this means we will never be able to live together, purely because we had a really good period a couple of months ago. I'm afraid that this experience will make us resent each other so badly that he will never ask to ever move in with me again in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this just normal for healthy couples too, or are we just really not good for each other? I'd rather come to terms with it sooner than later. I've talked to him about this as well, he knows that I'm posting this."
"Am I being dumb? So my boyfriend is really close with his family which I understand and I'm 100% ok with that. They're a really close and happy family which isnt something I ever really experienced, so when i found out that they do family stuff from 5 or 6 to like 12 it was a shocker. I got used to not talking to him in that time frame, which is already hard bc although i also like space, hes someone who doesnt need to talk to someone to feel fulfilled or worried like i do.

Whenever i try to text him before that, instead of telling me he has to go and then leaving, He just leaves me on read midconversation and doesnt text me back even until I feel like he remembers to like really late at night while hes playing a game, or until i text him goodnight. 

He's really bad at being emotional and sentimental as hes a very logical person while I'm the opposite of that. And i just dont know if im in the wrong or not to be upset that he doesnt reach out to me, or text me or do anything much for me. I get we're in quarentine so its hard to do anything so my expectations arent that high, but the thing is i really need him rn to just at least be there. 

Whenever I bring it up, he tells me that ""yknow u can always just text me whenever you want ill be there"" but its just tiring that I have to be the one to reach out, i want him to reach out too and tell me things and whatever.

Am I being too emotional? What should I do? I brought this up before and he reached out to me first for some time but then just stopped probably bc he thought that I was content so he didn't need to anymore. Im tired and I feel so upset bc I accidentally got emotional last night not really knowing why at him, and he just abruptly said goodnight and then we slept. I dont know if he misunderstood why I was upset, like maybe he thought I was upset abt his family which is not the case at all, but really just how he doesnt feel like my boyfriend at all."
"Narcissistic Ex W/ emotional abuse traits says they are struggling 6 months later. I need some advice and help. I left a 4 year long relationship back in early December just after thanksgiving. He was emotional/mentally abusive and had no respect for me. I’m 25 now and he’s now 30. 

I’ll try to make the back story short. He was great in the beginning, as we got 2-2 1/2 years in he started changing, more distant stopped caring as much, big huge arguments over small things. Then when we moved in together it got worse, the entire year I lived with him I was neglected, ignored id receive the silent treatment for days sometimes a week the longest ever was two weeks as if I didn’t exist in the same house. I felt like a ghost. He would snap over anything and it would turn into him screaming and fist pounding, spitting, throwing things and the gaslighting made me feel like I was insane and I’d just sit and cry begging him to stop screaming. Sometimes it was inches from my face, I’d say I was afraid and he’d scream even more saying “I’m not hitting you am I?” 

Well he got upset about a quote I liked on Facebook thinking it was about him, lead to me being ignored he stayed home for thanksgiving, we had a wedding that weekend and the following. He left without me leaving me home alone for the first wedding which he was the best man in and was gone all weekend. Ignored that entire week up until the following Thursday where I asked if I was going to the second wedding we had to go to. He said I wasn’t going. Which led to a conversation where I asked what was going on, I explained I was hurt, I made a appointment for counseling to try to work on things and he said he was not going to be going, I mentioned somethings he does are mentally abusive and he snapped and said if I didn’t take that statement back he was going to call the police on me. He never said he wanted to break up, that he wanted me to move out he just kept saying “he’s so tired of it all”

That was it, I decided Friday I needed to go. That Saturday when he was at the wedding I called my family and packed up my things and was gone before he got back. 


Here we are about 6 months later. Two weeks ago I receive a letter of him saying he wished he listened to understand instead of listen to reply, he should have fixed the silent treatment habit, and that I am a great woman. He said he was disappointed by how I left and thought we would handle the hard times like adults, but honestly I was afraid of him and he had already threatened to call the police on me for no reason at all. 

Then a random text today. Asking how am I. I said “I’m okay and you?” He said not well, so I asked, why not. To which his response was, 

“As much as I want to share, I wouldn’t even know where to begin. Im really hesitant to get into this with you.  So much so that I’ve made an appointment to talk to someone, professionally about it.” 


I’m just sitting here staring at the text. I don’t even know how to respond. I’m picking it apart, confused at the “I’m really hesitant to get into this with you.” I never screamed, I was never mean, I was always trying to understand. 

Part of me wants to say “I wish you would have just gone with me when I made a appointment but here we are almost 6 months later” 

I have no idea how to respond or handle the situation. I don’t understand his intentions. 

Very confused. Any insight? Opinions? Suggestions?"
"Double standard? I have been dating this guy for almost a year. I have seen him years ago through work, thought he was so perfect and cute, but didn’t talk to him because I was in a relationship. 

When we first started talking I saw he was getting snapchats from girls and also talking to girls on Facebook about technology related things (once when we were laying in bed and he was falling asleep). He doesn’t have Snapchat anymore and deleted the girl he was messaging  from his Facebook. 

Once he told me his ex had called him because her current bf committed suicide and she couldn’t believe he never reached out to see if she was okay. At the beginning of our relationship she would message him hey randomly but said he never responded. Also they had a short conversation on Facebook about him getting a new place and she asked about me. 

Anytime a man or ex has messaged me I tell him immediately so there are no surprises and he makes me delete it and asks why I never blocked my exes so they can’t contact me. 

Why is there a double standard here? 
Is it because he has been hurt in the past and paranoid?"
"Is there something I (19F) can do to explain to my boyfriend (18M) that he should social distance? My boyfriend and I started dating over a year ago in our senior year of high school and the relationship was going great until COVID-19 took center stage. Early in March I stopped going to local concerts with him because I wanted to social distance at least a bit, and when the stay at home orders happened (in California) I stopped seeing him in person because I wanted to flatten the curve. He was mad that I wouldn't see him since he bought into the whole ""corona-virus is a hoax"" mindset. That alone made me like him less, but it gradually got worse.

&amp;#x200B;

After a few weeks I realized that we were going to have to stay in quarantine for a while and started planning around that. My college had already made the shift to being online, but I started scheduling online game nights and other activities for fun but he wouldn't join them because he was angry that I was staying at home. Last night I proposed that we could see each other in person but we wear masks and stay a few feet apart to hang out and he replied ""If I don't get to fuck you I don't want to see you"" which was rudest thing he ever said to me so I hung up on him.

&amp;#x200B;

He's been rude and overall unpleasant to deal with during the quarantine. He (bisexual) has been going to parties with our mutual friends and hooking up with men on Grindr to make a point that the pandemic doesn't bother him. I'm pretty upset and I want to break up with him, but this is the only relationship I've been in where are cared about my partner this much. I still love him and tell myself that he's only acting up because the quarantine is so stressful, but I can't stand him anymore. How should I go forward in our relationship?

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Now that you all are pointing it out to me, yeah, he's not respecting me and that's important. I broke up with him over the phone half an hour ago and while that really hurt, I think it's for the best.  He was a great boyfriend for so long, but he's been a garbage person to me recently and that's more than enough reason to dump him/ Thanks for talking some sense into me :)"
"Fiancé wants me to get rid of dog So my fiancé
and I have been together almost 2 years. When we first were dating i was fostering a 1 year old German Shepherd dog. 

My fiance and I are moving out of state and my dog currently lives with my parents because my fiance thinks my dog is dangerous and a liability and doesn’t want the dog living back with us. This was her reasoning 

Before we started dating I fosters a GS dog who was severely abused. Before we got together he bit my my roommate A in the leg he had to get stitches. Then a couple months later my dog bit Roomate B in the face unprovoked.

A couple months my dog bit Roomate A again. the dog was jumping on guests and Roomate A had to pull the dog down and the dog turn around a bit Him in the arm And had to go to urgent care.  My dog was just scared and didn’t mean to hurt anyone  

She also thinks my dog is possessive because when we got a new place she says my dog was getting possessive of me and  acted aggressive and start snapping at her ans when i Reprimanded him my dog bit me. This again I felt
Like my fault not my dogs . 

A few months later while im at work my dog attacks my fiance she says it was Unprovoked. She has to get stitches. At this point Shes furious and tells me to get rid of the dog but instead i gives my dog to my family. They love my dog and think my she is being dramatic 

The dog has been with my fam now for almost a year and we are moving out of state and she doesnt want me to bring my dog with us but I told her I love my dog and want him with us. She says she doesn’t feel safe around my dog and I’m heartbroken because I feel I have to choose between my future wife and my best friend.

I told my fiancé that we are buying a house with a yard so the dog can run and let off energy but she’s still scared of the dog.
Since giving the dog to my fam a year ago there hasn’t been a biting incident. She keeps saying that she still doesn’t trust a dog that has bit multiple times 

What should I do? Should I tell my fiancé that the dog is coming with us no matter what or give the dog to my family? I’m
So lost and devastated"
"My Ex is now with my old best friend This is a repost of my r/Infidelity post

Original Post Link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/gfraa5/my\_ex\_is\_now\_with\_my\_old\_best\_friend/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/gfraa5/my_ex_is_now_with_my_old_best_friend/)

I wanted to repost here as my original post has been getting what I would consider more bias comments than I want, which makes sense due to the sub. Not ignoring them because I'm trying to get my own validation but more so because my friends who've read the post and some of the comments think my story would be better viewed with a less bias light.

There are points in this story that some would consider cheating, which is a fair claim but I'm still on the fence as to how to look at the whole situation which is my main reason for posting. Because I believe unforgivable cheating requires more dishonesty and malice of forethought.

About 3 months ago my girlfriend(Ex) at the time and I split up, the reason for us splitting up was that she had developed feeling for my at the time good friend (A). Ex and A are now dating and have been since pretty much the day we broke up.

For some backstory on them:Ex is a girl who I had dated for 5 years since our last couple of years in high school. She has severe anxiety and depression issues because of this around the time we started dating she didn't have many friends and all of my friends including A, so over those 5 years they had become pretty good friends too.

A is a boy I've known since grade 4 (9yo) while for many years we were inseparable over the last few years it became apparent that he was really not growing up at all. He dropped out of high school and has not found any work (or even tried to) in the 4 years since. He was a friend I always enjoyed my time which I think really blinded me to how much he really wasn't a good friend. Fairly often myself and all our other friends would attempt to help him get his life together going as far as correcting his resumes and even getting him interviews (that he didn't show up to). Around the few months this story takes place in many of our friends had stopped talking to him due to stuff like this and ultimately the general toll it put on us to try and help him.

The story:

A few months before I was aware anything was really going on between them A had begun to start getting very angry and depressed about the general state of him life. Me and my other friends tried to talk to him but he would only really talk to Ex about his issues, probably because he was ashamed to appear weak in front of the boys (which is ridiculous because most of our other friends had been very open about their issues and were in no way made fun of). Because of A's state of mind Ex begun to start spending a lot of time with him, without me around. This was fine because I had no reason to distrust Ex and to my knowledge our relationship was going fine.

After a little while of them hanging out one of my friends who was good friends with Ex's best friend told me that Ex told her best friend she was beginning to fall for A. At which point I was already suspecting that A was having feelings for Ex because honestly the only other girl he even speaks to is his mum. I believe it's important to have a fair bit of trust in a relationship and had no real reason to question Ex about it.

About 4 months ago Ex told me she wanted to have a serious conversation and began to explain to me that both Ex and A talked about being interested in each other, she told me that they had kissed and that she wasn't feeling as attracted to me as she used to. In the conversation we decided that we would try to still make our relationship work until she made a decision as to who she wanted to be with. Soon after we were having a small party with our close friends where Ex and A became very drunk and began to make sexually contact that I was forced to watch, thinking back to it still makes me sick to my stomach but luckily one of my friends saw it and stopped them. Ex was too drunk to remember it and honestly with her severe depression I didn't really wanna give her more reason to hate herself.

3 months ago we broke up, well realistically she broke up with me and began dating A. Throughout the whole ordeal A had not said a word about it to me or apologized in any way. At the time I thought if he would've said sorry or had a real conversation with me about everything I would forgive him but it's been 3 months and he has said nothing. Ex however was one of my best friends for years and was more or less honest with me throughout and we are still friends (as much as we can be given circumstances).

The main reason I made this post was because I acknowledge that some people have viewed what Ex did as cheating I'd like to not see it that way and even though I don't think she technically did it's given a type of negative aversion to the topic of cheating (not that i thought it was in anyway justifiable more that now when the topic comes up my stomach falls into knots).

Also after talking to several people about this they've voiced some opinions I really wasn't happy to hear such as: 'Boys and girls shouldn't get to close to other people if they're in relationship', 'people can't be friends of opposite gender (or attractive preference) because they inevitably get feelings' and literally 'if you give a partner to much trust this stuff will happen'

I've had people tell me that there state of mind (depression/anxiety) during this should have no impact on how I think about what they did. But as someone who has never suffered from anything even like that but seen many people close to me go through it I can't with clear conscience make that judgement as I understand it, that state of mind effects literally everything you do. To be clear I don't think it gives people a free pass by any means but I consider myself a forgiving person and if after 5 years Ex makes a couple of mistakes under distress than I never speak to her again seems pretty wild an unreasonable.

So, Reddit: Are my friends and family being unreasonable by now shunning Ex even though I am not? Should I have not forgiven Ex even though you can't control who you fall for? Should this experience change the way I approach relationships going forward? Any other helpful advice.

Thanks for taking the time to read my venting.

TL;DR My Ex fell in love with one of my best friends while we were dating and now they're together.

Edit: I've clarified some things on here that weren't clarified in the original post, I'm not trying to defend what was done to me but if I do a post making them out to be completely villains it's not really possible to get any type of impartial views.

Edit 2: Some clarification on our relationship slightly prior to the story, I was honestly as happy as I've ever been (aside from the obvious not being able to help my partners depression) and she was getting more depressed, seeing psychs and taking antidepressants. We had conversations about her not being happy in her current life and despite still loving me as much as ever she was unsure if she could be happier with a complete change to her life."
"My (32F) mom (53F) never stops talking when we are together and I’m at my wits end. On mobile so apologize for the long paragraph. This isn’t a new thing from quarantine. She has been like this for years and years. Whenever I spend time with my mom, I get maybe a couple of sentences in. Last night I spent 2 hours with her and she never even asked me how I am doing. Never allowed me to finish a single thought. She just drones on and on about things happening in her life. Generally it is about the same few subjects she always talks about. I leave feeling very drained and not wanting to spend time with her again. Sometimes I just stop responding at all. In the beginning of our time together I will try to be engaged, but after a while of her clearly not wanting to show any interest in my life, or what I have I say, I just mentally check out. She also tends to be very negative and judgmental of others which really makes the mood feel icky. I don’t want to be mean to her - I love her dearly - but how do I talk about this with her? Has anyone else had an experience with this? Thanks."
"My brothers homophobic So I’m living at home with my parents well working and attending school, because of the corona virus I attend online classes and don’t have to work anymore. I’ve been spending more time with my family and my brother, who has always been very straight forward asked me if I was gay. I myself don’t even know so when he asked me I just told him that I like girls but I’m not sure exactly what my sexuality is, he asked me if I was bi and then told me that “bisexuality isn’t a thing” and “you either like boys or girls” then he told me about how he doesn’t like gay people, and that he would “beat the shit outta any gay guy he saw” and that he “hate the part of me that likes girls but still loves me”

I was shocked, I mean what was I supposed to say back? I tried to make jokes about how at least we had something in common now (the fact that we like girls) the whole situation just made me super uncomfortable and I know that my dad and other brother are even more homophobic. it scares me to think that one day I’m going to have to tell the rest of my family."
"My Friend (22F) Keeps telling Everyone She Was Raped When She Wasn't I'm M24 and my friend Sarah got drunk tipsy at a guys house like 2 years ago and gave him a blowjob, the guy was drunk too. Right after that she came to our group of friends and told us this and said she wasn't that drunk but they didn't have sex she just gave him head but she wouldn't have done it if she wasn't drunk and he was drunk too. She didn't blackout or anything and actually took an uber home after they were done hooking up. All the girls in our friend group told her to go to the police and all the guys didn't want a part in this. She went to the police and they did an investigation and obviously no charges were laid. 

She still brings this up to this day saying how she was sexually assaulted or raped and I tell her that no she wasn't if anything, she sexually assaulted that guy. This is really putting a dent in our friendship because she thinks I'm a POS rapist for not believing her and our other friends in our friend group also think this as well. 

I told her she needs to get therapy, because I acknowledge that it was a traumatic experience for her."
Thoughts? Okay so it’s been a month and a few days when my bf broke up with me. It was pretty painful how he ended things between us.it was a mess.i. He blocked me everywhere.

Should i just give up and let this go? Or wait? I dont know what to do.i really wanna still be friends and have contact with him. any advice? your answers in pm/chat. Thanks in advace.
"Is my(19F) relationship with my girlfriend(22F) inherently toxic? I made a throw away just in case. 

For context, my girlfriend and I met through a mutual friend (18), Alex. We were introduced in late October when I was 17 and she was 20, though didn't really start talking about getting together until early January once I had turned 18. She didn't like wait for me to turn 18 or anything, it just happened that we started talking a few days before my birthday and that was when we got close. We have a three year age gap, and I've recently noticed how a lot of people online give a harsh look when it's that kind age gap. 

She told me she understood she was at a different point in life than me (I was just about to graduate high school and she was starting a 'big boy' job/trying to go back to college), but that the difference in age wasn't something she would hold over my head in a way to treat me like a child. Though now we've been together for just over a year and I can't help but wonder if our relationship is inherently toxic or just bad. Even though I am older now, we did become somewhat friends when I was 17 and she knew me as a minor for a while. We hung out a few times then both with Alex and alone. Sometimes I do wonder if that power imbalance still exists despite us being more on the same page about what we're doing now, but it was never really a cause for concern until I saw some posts on social media warning girls to stay away from people in their 20's going after people my age at the time. Because turning 18 doesn't magically make you an adult a month in, and I know that. 

I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking things or if it's something to actually be of concern. Occasionally I do get frustrated with the age gap thing because she likes to drink, and I hate drinking even now. She's told me she's excited for me to get a fake or turn 21 so we can go out but honestly, I hate the idea of it. She was a party animal at my age and I'm the total opposite. I don't like that kind of thing and at times it feels like she expects I will be too/will want to be when she goes out with her friends. Or sometimes it does feel like I'm getting talked down to, but I've told her in these specific instances and she's apologized and has actually fixed it. 

Is a relationship that started like this bad and/or toxic? I understand that at my age *now* the gap isn't a huge thing. But that doesn't erase the fact of how we started and how she knew me two years ago(ish) when I was only 17."
"Am I (F16) being selfish/reacting wrongly after my (ex) boyfriend (M16) wants to be only friends? Just a heads up, I know this is just a high school relationship like how it’ll mostly likely end after high school and I’m probably putting way too much emotion into this but I really want to put in the effort of being in this relationship, since I really do love the guy so much but there is so much to fix. I just want to know if I’m reacting selfishly (more so than already) or if I’m doing anything wrong on how I’m progressing with it and advice on how I can better myself for future reference.

So about a couple days ago, my (ex) boyfriend, let’s call him Matt, said that he really wanted to break it off and be friends for a while. Now the reason he did it was, I thought, very understandable and good on him for knowing what’s good for him to be honest. Why he did it was because there was lack of communication and trust between us, and well as me not working on my issues like I kept assuring him I was. There’s a ton of them but just to name the main ones, being really self deprecative/harsh of myself, taking everything way too seriously whenever he joked around or not, had little to no self esteem, wouldn’t tell him anything about myself like interests or stuff and just being an overall mean and grouchy person to talk to but also really sensitive too. And if Matt and his friend tried to confront me to mention it, I said I would fix it but returned to how I was like a day or two afterwards. Im guessing the last straw was a little before this, Matt said he wanted to talk but I eventually forget and brushed it aside until he finally collapsed and said he couldn’t do it anymore, he keeps getting hurt since I can’t face my issues to him or just face him at all and he wants to be friends until I fixed them or manage to get them under control. 

I was and still am in full on shambles and keep getting breakdowns over it. I’ve been so stupid, selfish, blind to everything I did and knowingly did too. I don’t know how but he still wants to talk to me, but just doesn’t want to go back in since he doesn’t want to be in that position again. That part, I still don’t know how but I am so grateful for that. Matt said he wants to get back into the relationship but just not like how it was before. He also said he doesn’t want to wait forever for me to fix them or be actually able to manage them so guess if I take forever, he’s just not gonna be interested anymore. 

As of right now, I’ve been trying to fix my issues, keeping them low by boosting my self esteem, reminding myself to keep things extremely simple in terms of overthinking, sharing things or doing small rants and just overall trying to be a better version of myself, compared to how I was while being in a relationship with Matt. All the while still bursting into tears about how I’ve managed to mess up this badly. Also bursting into tears about the fact that if I don’t earn his trust back or fix my issues well enough, he’s not going to want to take me back.

I know this probably sounds dumb but I really do want to fix this. And even if it doesn’t work out, I want to be able to know that I really tried one more time. Also, I mistreated Matt BAD so might as well try to make amends that way, even if he doesn’t want to get back together after all. 

Again, I just want to know if I’m going about this selfishly or if I’m doing anything wrong repairing up our trust and such. I feel like my perspective is so muddied up that I can’t tell if this is right or wrong of me to do so also want some new eyes on this too. Thanks and hope Reddit won’t tear a new one on me, even tho I completely deserve it."
"Has anyone used enlisting in the military as something to facilitate moving on from an emotionally dependent relationship? I made a post on here a few hours ago for more additional context, but the gist of it is that I'm curious about whether people have successful or unsuccessful experiences with using the required focus and time investment of the military as a way to 'separate' and move on whilst not being forced to be cut off from friends and family and human contact.  


This wouldn't be **the** reason I'd consider enlisting. It's something I've considered for a while, and simply find now that I have no relationship obligations keeping me from seriously considering it."
"I (28m) am wracked with anxiety after being in dysfunctional relationship with gf(30f) wondering what the best practical options for dealing with post relational anxiety are and advice for establishing a healthy relationship in the future Little background story. I started dating a woman 9-10
months ago. Things were going great initially. She was incredibly charming, friendly, attractive, shared values, and we had mutual friends.

She met my family and they thought she was fantastic. But my sister and Mom did have some reservations about how often she would bring up trauma from her past. She’d mention ex-boyfriends a lot. 

Looking back on our second date, she also mentioned how terrible her relationship was with her mother, who she said was emotionally abusive and very controlling. I didn’t think this was too concerning that she mentioned this so early; I just thought she was very open and honest. 

I figured I am a very empathetic person, open, and honest person as well. I don’t give up on people easily and I am always trying to give people the benefit of the doubt. I work in the healthcare industry.She even disclosed she had attachment issues and was seeing a counselor. I figured she was just working through some stuff and I would just be supportive of her. After all, everyone has some emotional baggage. We are all human. 

However, stuff started to turn a corner eventually
in the relationship as time went on. She would
mention her exes by name, which were many and she kept on bringing up the trauma. I told her I could handle hearing general details but could not handle hearing her talk about another guy by name. Even so, she continually brought stuff up. I also told her that maybe it would be best to talk with her counselor about it. 

And also she also had a lot of trauma from her mother that she would continually bring up in regards to our relationship.

For example, we had talked about marriage and said I wasn’t going to give her a timeline in terms of when I would feel comfortable proposing, but I did give her a general estimate of the longest amount of time I’d wait before marrying. She would get super upset and said I was controlling for not giving her a specific date and blamed me saying I held all the power in the relationship. Basically, it felt like the unresolved trauma with her Mom and feeling insecure about not being loved and controlled was leaking into our relationship. 

I told her that I was wanting marriage eventually and we decided to take pre-engagement classes together.  First session went horrible, I thought we’d spend the time discussing us as a couple but she mainly told
the counselor all about her childhood trauma with her mother. I was concerned. 

Also the day prior to deciding upon taking pre-engagement class I had planned on talking with her at a certain time. Unfortunately, a work meeting came up that I forgot about. I texted her about it after receiving a missed call and told her I would tell her an hour later and I explained the situation. I was excited to tell her because I was stoked for pre-engagement classes!! But she was not happy. She basically spiraled for probably 8 hours and the night culminated with her threatening to break up with me. She mentioned her Mom and not feeling loved in that relationship and how she wasn’t going to be in a relationship with me
where I did that too. I reassured her that she is love able. 

The next day. She said she wanted to do the class with me. I was floored. I told her, how is it possible to want to do it when last night you were threatening  to break up with me? Obviously not enough security in the relationship. 

She then just played it off that that was her anxiety talking. I really loved and cared about her. And I thought stuff would get better so I went to the session.

She then started being really controlling with my time. Whenever, I’d get off the phone with her she’d make comments about how work was more important then her and how I wasn’t a priority to her. I was at a family event and she made me feel guilty about it, saying I chose my family over her. She’d sometimes relate these feelings to past trauma with past boyfriends or her mother. I’d spend literally 2-4 hours  on the phone with her everyday for 1-2months. My family started to get concerned about me because I looked tired all the time. 

She invited for me to come down and stay with her for a week (since she lives in a different town). I told her I’d come for a week prior to starting my next job. She said she wanted two weeks. I told her my feelings about that idea and how I was grieving the leaving the friends and family in the town I lived in. She was very compassionate and said she understood me. Then a couple hours later she would text me angrily saying she obviously wasn’t a priority in her life. 

I was surprised because I was dumping more and more time and effort in the relationship and stuff was getting worse. And her trauma she used as a reason mfor many of the things she did. 

I finally decided to break up with her because it was getting too much to handle. At the end, she started to make me feel like I was crazy or mentally unstable. She would say something wasn’t important and didn’t matter that much too her. And then get angry later at me for it when I planned accordingly. She would alternate between saying she completely chill about something and then blow up at me later when I acted according to what information she gave me. 

When I confronted her about this, she got angry with me, saying I was condescending or rude and making her feel like she was bad. I reassured her she wasn’t bad, she just needs to live up to her word and couldn’t expect me to turn plans around on a dime. 

I finally got to the point where I was no longer able to accommodate her wants. I felt exhausted by the relationship. I broke up with her but she said she wanted to continue with stuff. I couldn’t handle it though. I felt like I was walking on eggshells all the time because everything would trigger a memory from her mom or a past boyfriend. I stated to feel like I was having panic attacks thinking about the way she’d unleash on me if that happened.

I noticed that when I’d share my feelings she’d be sweet sometimes but then later she’d be really dismissive and make me feel like I was selfish. I couldn’t handle it. She also started to have conspiratorial theories about my family. And she was told me, she thought I was being controlled, abused, or manipulated by a family member.

I feel traumatized and anxious about the relationship. So many good friendships and family relationships suffered while dating her. 

Curious as to what might be some good methods to recovering. Here have been my current strategies:
-making a list of ways that both her and I contributed dysfunction to the relationship
-calm app for sleep and daily meditations 
-Bilateral stimulation (via anxiety release app) when feeling nervous 
- talking with friends/family about relationship
-crying (a lot of this has occurred). They say humor is a mature coping mechanism :) 
-dealing with a lot of self blame at points as though I was somehow stupid for not sticking out the relationship longer 

TLDR: dysfunctional relationship and feeling traumatized after the relationship. Looking for practical ways, resources, and ways to deal with anxiety after the relationship and establish a healthy relationship in the future."

I create an image of this person in my head, their behaviour and reactions. I know i shouldn't but I can't help it. They're constantly on my mind.


For the first couple of months I didn't know how that person looked like and I didn't care, I just wanted to get to know them because of their amazing personality. When I finally saw a picture I thought: wow. When we first talked through the phone I was not nervous at all, I felt comfortable as hell (sometimes even the shortest phonecalls with friends stress me out).


We don't talk daily, but we do exchange long texts and call each other once a week or so. Each time we do it ends up being a couple hours long. It's lovely, best couple of hours in a week. I'm smiling all the time, the thought of an upcoming call makes me feel butterflies and after a call I can't stop but to recall what we talked about with even bigger smile. Most of the time it's silly stuff.


We haven't argued but I shared some low times with them. They never told me to back off with it, they were supportive and seemed to truly care. They don't share much of their worries but at the slightest hint of a bad mood I am here for them. I want to be involved but I don't want to be pushy about it.


I feel so happy just thinking about this person. Ever since we exchanged first messages I did and it only seems to grow. I just got off a call with them and I can't fall asleep, thinking about how I would love to hug the hell out of that person in real life. 


I think I'm in love, but I never really was before so I can't tell for sure. A friend suggested it might be just a temporary fascination - ""new"" person, different country, someone ""out of my reach"". And I truly don't know whether that might be true. I know for a fact I get crushes easily, but they usually change as easily.


I also told the person multiple times how much our friendship means to me when I felt overwhelmed with emotions and they always repeated the feeling is mutual. The feeling of friendship. No idea whether they think about me the way I think about them. I don't want to ruin it by going too far and I also don't want to build a romantic relationship over the internet alone. If i could fly over to see whether my feelings don't change after spending time with this person in real life I would, without hesitation. I can't though, and it makes me really frustrated. I have never wanted to be physically next to someone so much. But what if those feelings change? Will that mean I was never truly in love and that it was but a tenporary feeling, or a feeling towards an idealised version of that person? I have no idea what to do about this relationship. On one hand I want to hint what's in my head but on the other I fear making stuff weird between us.


I'm sorry the age/gender stuff is unclear, I tried keeping it vague just in case. The age gap between us isn't big though (less than 5 years) and I think we get along just fine."
"How do I deal with my partners mum? This could be long so feel free to click off. 
Me (20f) and my partner (20m) have been together for about 2 years now. At the beginning of our relationship his mum was an alcoholic which I didn’t know at the time the first time she drank around me we all drank together for her birthday in the livingroom just the 3 of us and she was telling me about how she’s been telling people about me and talking about me as if I’m family she drunkenly told me she loved me which I took with a pinch of salt and she told me she wanted me to be her daughter in law. I’m the first girl my boyfriend has ever brought home to his mum so I thought it was clearly just over excitement. The next few months she would drink every time I was round which is where I realised she was an alcoholic and me and my partner had had a talk about her drinking. We would sit and talk all night and she would tell me how made up she is with me and all that kind of stuff. I thought everything was going well she used to come upstairs and ask me to come to the shop with her and we would talk and just get along I’d go wirh her to pick her grandkids up etc. All without my boyfriend btw. And then one day she just switched she got drunk pulled me to the side and told me I have to tell my boyfriend he has to do a b c or I will split up with him. Or she would tell me I’m just making excuses and being lazy when after my 6 day working week I would just want to relax with my boyfriend for the day I had off. It then turned into her sitting on the couch alone barely being able to put words together telling me she can’t talk to me about personal things because me and her son aren’t going to last long. The next morning my boyfriend asked her why she said that stuff and told her he didn’t appreciate what she keeps saying to me and she would say she was just speaking her mind calling me hard work etc and saying he shouldn’t listen to me about petty things like me and her had different opinions on a coat my boyfriend bought. She then cut off drinking and was abit difficult for a while which we put to withdrawals. She had a period of about 2 weeks where she was back to the way she was at the beginning and then since then it’s been downhill. Before lockdown out of no where she banned me from coming to the house which me and my boyfriend worked around of course. Since lockdown shes been talking about me to him in ways I don’t really appreciate. About how I’m not close family so we can’t see eachother until October however his older sisters partner came and slept round for the weekend last weekend. When he asked her about it she straight away cut him off and said I don’t care she’s not family. Which I sort of understood as I am not family but neither is his sisters partner. Our anniversary is coming up in just over a month and I’ve still been “banned” from seeing him. Lately she’s been demeaning me to him and the last time I saw her she wouldn’t even look in my direction. I now have some difficult feelings about coming back to their house when I’m “allowed” and it makes me feel really shit that his mum behaves this way about me and talks about me this way. 

TLDR: my boyfriends mum is rude to me and talks bad about me to my boyfriend and I’m struggling to decide what to do about it."
"How do I tell my(25) husband(25) that I'm not physically attractive to him right now? He has let his hair and beard grow out crazy - he looks very messy and he's also a mechanic, so he's dirty and his skin is basically stained ""dirty"" unless he rubs himself raw. I accepted the mechanic part, and that he will never look 100% ""clean."" But now that his beard is going wild and his hair is unkept, he looks homeless.

I've made suggestions of trimming his beard, maybe shaving it down a bit to let it thicken out a little more because growing longer. I've mentioned manscaping it, and also giving his hair a trim, just the sides that are flipping outward. Every time, he turns me down. Says he wants his beard long and will go to the barber when quarantine is over (he hasn't had it cut since maybe December so I'm not 100% he would do that.)

I currently do not find him attractive when I look at him because of it. How else do I tell him I need him to clean up a little bit? I don't want to hurt his feelings because we are also working on other parts of our relationship, but I also don't want to dictate how he styles himself ya know. I guess I just don't know if I should live with it or push him to trim up a little.

ETA: idk if he saw this post or got annoyed with me, but he up and decided this morning to shave his head. So there's that lol"
"I (23f) feel horrible for wanting space from my boyfriend (23m) while he's depressed, but I am unsure how to handle the situation throwaway account.

My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) have been together 3 years. He’s always struggled with mental health issues since I’ve known him — mostly anxiety and occasional panic attacks, but in the past 9 months, he’s been depressed. We’ve always talked about these issues candidly: I struggled with very deep depression when I was younger, and he’s had depression on and off. We’ve been staying at his parents’ place during quarantine. Normally, we share a small apartment together (have lived together for over a year). His parents are very generous letting us stay with them, but I don’t have much in common and feel kind of unwelcome with his step mom who is usually in the kitchen/living room/other places we’d hang out that aren’t the bedroom where we are both working remotely. He \*really\* doesn’t get along with his stepmom. So we mostly stay in this room when we aren’t doing something outside. 

Every now and then he used to slip into a depressive episode and feel hopeless and upset and not want to do anything. I would always spend time talking with him to get to the root of why he was feeling bad and ultimately, sometimes after hours of talking, he would feel better. I got him to start seeing a therapist and made it clear I wasn’t capable of being the only person for him to talk to about his mental health issues, that this would have a negative effect on our relationship. Since quarantine, he hasn’t been seeing a therapist and has been having tons of these depressive episodes. Sometimes they’re during the day when I should be working. When I talk to him to try to help and he’s very hopeless, “it’s never going to get better,” etc., I have urged him to start speaking to a therapist he really likes and is honest with, because he’s said he didn’t really talk about his depression and deep issues with his past therapist. I also said he can try going on meds and try other coping mechanisms that a medical professional, \*not me\*, could recommend. We’ve gone through this several times now and he always ends up apologizing for “dragging me down” and feels bad about it and promises to seek help. He has yet to make any moves toward doing so. 

He also recently told me he feels like he isn’t his own person, that he just goes about his day “according to my schedule” and resents this. I don’t impose on him at all, I just happen to have a 9-5 job while he’s still in school and doesn’t have a job or many extra curricular things. This was the case before quarantine too. I said maybe we should take a break so he can find his own rhythm and figure things out without me and my schedule getting in the way. I also brought up that I’m uncomfortable feeling like my life revolves around his emotional schedule, even though I know he can't control it, and I’m going to step back when he’s having an episode so he can feel like he’s not relying on me as a crutch. I think I was wrong to always comfort him and stay with him to talk it through while he’s visibly depressed, and now he relies on my attention. I also think he will grow to resent me for not letting him figure it out for himself. 

It definitely hurts to hear him constantly talk about how he’s unhappy and things won’t get better. I know it’s depression and I can’t fix it, but I care about him deeply and feel like I’m making it worse. I’m also really struggling with my own family issues and mental health since we’ve been in quarantine. I like being able to go outdoors which we can’t do in our city apartment, but I feel so uncomfortable around his stepmom and even his dad and one of his brothers. They’re really wealthy and judgmental and I feel like a burden even though I’m trying hard to earn my keep here. 

I feel like I’m starting to resent him because his parents fund his life while he’s in school (we live frugally) while I’m working and financially independent. He’s graduating this month, and doesn’t have anything lined up. We have to pay rent in June and I’m not sure if his parents will pay it, but I know he doesn’t have the money to pay it himself. I have been working my ass off to save money and I really don't want to spend it on his rent. I’m worried that unless he starts seeing a therapist and really working on his mental health, he won’t be able to find a job and function in the world. I have thought about spending my life with him, but I’m worried I’ll always have to be the rock. Sometimes I feel myself getting angry with him for what I perceive to be inequalities in our relationship, and I was looking forward to those things changing when he graduated and got a job, but now it doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen. I know this isn’t his fault because mental health issues are really complicated, and I feel guilty for my resentment. 

During one of his depression episodes on Sunday, I said I wanted to go back to our apartment and have some time apart. I told him our relationship doesn’t feel healthy anymore. He agreed to drive me back in but was really upset. I was upset too, but I reached a breaking point. I needed space, and honestly, I think he really needs time away from me to figure out what’s best for him. After talking for a while, he asked me not to go, said he promised he’d work on things and look for help, and I agreed to stay, partially because being in the city right now is pretty dangerous (we live in a big COVID city). I was feeling optimistic that he’d start looking for therapists, etc… Until yesterday when he had another episode. I honestly couldn’t deal with it. I felt trapped in that tiny room with him after working all day, and I just let him ride it out and didn’t try to help. Later I told him that’s what I was going to do going forward, and I thought it was best for us. Today while I was working and had a document to get to a coworker by the end of the day, he had another moment. At first I tried to talk to him, but I felt so frustrated and could feel that it would devolve into an hours-long thing. I had to work. If I was at work, he would’ve had to figure it out himself. So I told him sorry, I can’t help, I have to work. He seems really upset about this. I feel guilty, but I can’t help him anymore. He still hasn’t sought out help from any professionals, friends, family, etc. I want to go back to the apartment and take a break because I think it’ll be best for us both. Am I being insensitive? How can I deal with this? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr My boyfriend of 3 years is extremely depressed and leaning on me a lot, won't seek other help despite my asking him to many times. I want to take some space for us both but am worried I'll be abandoning him."
"My boyfriend doesn't love me The other night my (35f) bf (43m) and I were talking and I can't even remember how the subject came round to it but basically he said he doesn't love me, and never has. There was no row leading up to it or anything and I had suspected as much but I just don't know what to do now. We live together, have been together 2 years, we're currently in lockdown. He says 'he loves me, but not in that way' but also 'can't imagine a life without me in it' . I feel so confused, I don't know what any of that really means. He says he isn't over his ex (who he was only with for 18 months) I don't know what to do. I love him very much and I just feel so hurt and confused about what I should do. Any advice would be gratefully received."
"My Friend is Miserable and needs help So this friend that I game with has been dating this girl for around 6 months. Everything was fine until this quarantine started. All of a sudden he stopped talking to us and ignored us for most of the day. It turns out his girlfriend has become super manipulative and wont let him speak to any of his friends or even family...shes psycho. We have told him to break up with her many times but he says the pain of breakup is worse than being with her, even though he misses talking to his friends. What should we do to try to help him?"
"My ldr boyfriend is depressed and he’s pushing me away for 3 weeks now and doesnt reply to my messages im just confussed as hell and i’m waiting everyday for a text, should i keep texting him?"
"My (22F) fiancé (35M) doesn’t know that I know he’s been lying to me and trying to cover it up. My fiancé and I have been together for a little over 5 years now. Two years into the relationship I discover he had been lying about certain things he was doing like failing to keep up with his schooling and not passing classes. After I found out, he promised he wouldn’t lie again. 

Three years into the relationship I find out he had been discussing problems in our relationship with his ex-wife who are still friends. I found this out after months of being suspicious of him and decided to look into his phone. I knew this was wrong but this was the only way I felt I could find out the truth. After discovering this, I lost trust in him but didn’t want to leave him. I have asked him before and recently if I could look at certain conversations he’s had with others to prove to me that he wasn’t lying.

Fast forward to the past month or so and I find out he’s been lying to me again about conversations with his boss as well as conversations with his ex-wife. I got suspicious about what he was telling me and found this out by looking through his phone once more. However, I’ve noticed that since I’ve asked him to allow me to see conversations he’s had, he’s been deleting messages in order to hide things from me. 
I am unsure of what to do because I love him and don’t want to leave him. 

TL;DR: My fiancé knows I don’t trust him and ask to see his phone sometimes so he’s been lying to me and deleting messages to try and cover up his lies. 

1. How do I address the fact that he’s been lying to me and trying to cover up his lies in our relationship? 

2. What can I do to get him to stop lying to me?"
"my relationships are getting worst what should i do?(my childhood story that couldn't be worst) this is not about my love life. this is about my family.

"Can seem to end an argument Me (22F) and my bf (26M) can't seem to find a middle ground for solving our problems in our relationship. We have been together for two years now and it doesn't seem to get better with our compromising skills.

When little things that I don't think need an argument (maybe just an acknowledgment)  come up, it quickly gets made into an argument. 

Ex. He continues to make jokes after i say ""I love you "" claiming that I don't.  

I have brought it up to him multiple times that it makes me uncomfortable when he says that and he continues to say it. He says that when I bring it up it that I am pointing things out in him and I get incredibly frustrated that my point on it is not being heard. There is other little situations like this that I don't think need an argument but he makes it into a full blown argument. I asked him why he does it and he says he gets spiteful on purpose because I keep bringing things up like this.I reached out to him the day after the argument once everything calms down and say that I am sorry and that I love him but he never says sorry and it really bothers me.

I have tried asking him what he would like to do as a way to solve these arguments but he says that he doesn't want to solve things 'my way' (which is talk about it if it happens and if it happens again then bring up a friendly reminder that it makes me uncomfortable) but his version of compromising is doing things his way(bring it up once and never talk about it again, even if the other person continues to do something that makes the other person uncomfortable.)

This virus is making everything more stressful and these little arguments are driving me insane. 

Any tips for finding a middle ground in this situation?"
"I (17f) can't shake this feeling that my boyfriend (17m) aren't meant to be even though he makes me so happy I love him. I really do. I fantasize about marrying him and having kids with him and just being loved by him for forever, and he does the same back. Every time I think about breaking up with him I just get absolutely overwhelmed with this sense of sadness and I just can't imagine not being with him.

But we're 17. He's not my first relationship (my first was an absolute shitshow and doesn't even feel real), but he's the first s/o I had that actually loved me back. And I'm so incredibly grateful for him, but again, we're 17, and I just get this feeling that if I commit my life to him I'll be missing out, that I won't know if he's truly ""the one"" because I don't have anything but a bad relationship to compare him to, and I don't know. And this doubt just keeps growing worse the closer I get to college, and we've been together for about two years, and I just. I feel like I'm betraying him for even doubting our relationship, for making hard plans to move in together and get married and build a life together (but WAY after college, of course) when I'm not even sure it'll happen yet, even though I want it to. I feel like I'm leading him on even though I love him, and idk.

I feel stupid for asking this, but just, I don't know what to do here. I don't know which part of me is right. I don't even know what questions I should be asking, but just. Is it stupid of me to think we'll last? Do other people doubt their relationships even though there's love in it? How do I not ruin this, even though I'm doubting us? 

I don't think this is long enough to warrant a TL/DR, but just to put it concisely: I love my boyfriend and I don't want to lose him, but I also don't feel like he's the one (but I want to? is that something I can even choose?), and I don't know how to make myself stop doubting us. I just need some advice here."
"Switching from high school sweethearts to adult relationship Me (17) and my boyfriend (same age) are still in high school and loves each other a lot. As school is beginning to end and life is getting upon everything is becoming more serious. Some aspects goes really well, we have savings for a house in the future and talked about how it will be when he starts to work and I go to uni. This is when I realise how little time exists. These days we both work and go to school, he likes to drive and work with all sorts of vehicles and I love to work out and take care of my very beloved plants. 

The other day I basically broke down because this week we both have had a lot of work, tho he more than me because he works with scarification and I as a waitress so during these times I mostly sit home. When he came home he wanted to play games with his friend because it was a long time ago. And next week we both have lots to do and so on. 

I basically felt sad because I got no time with him and I saw no time later where I got to be with him. Moral of the story, I understand that we’re both becoming adults and it’s new to me. I understand that he wants to hang out with friends and do things he love. But at the same time, I look at our schedules for the week and as no “together” time. My anxiety doesn’t make it easy to just bite my lips and endure it and just, be happy for the few together times we get. So that’s kind of the question here, how do I handle that we’re both getting grown up heh? Will it always be this way?
(We do live together tho, so when he don’t work night I get to sleep with him at least)."
"Boyfriend is still in love with his ex I just found out that my (f,22) boyfriend (m,24) of three years was in love with his ex fwb 6 months ago. He had contact with her over the last 2,5 years through gaming and texting and always told me I had nothing to worry about, there were no romantic feelings involved, I had no reason to be jaleous and so on.
We are going through a rough patch right now and I had a feeling something was up because of his behaviour towards her. Plus, other friends that play the same game as him and her told me that it seems like he is in love with her, so I asked him if he has feelings for her. That's when he told me he did have feelings a half year ago.
I feel so betrayed that the used my trust like that. He always told me that I had no reason to be jaleous when I obviously did and always convinced me that I was overreacting and that everything's normal and ok. He also got me to go to a board game night with her and her friends 5 months ago, which fits right in the time he had these feelings. I'm just mad and sad and want to clear the air with him but I have no idea what to think or say right now. Does anyone have any advice?"
"My partners (23M) parents think I'm (23F) stealing him away from them. Morning yall. First off I wanna say,long ass post incoming, this is one of my first non NSFW posts on reddit, but I've seen a lot of good advice on this sub and right now I'm really lost as to what to do. 
Also, I'm typing on mobile so please forgive any mistakes. I'm trying my best. 

So a little background first, my boyfriend (let's call him Tom for now) and I have known each other since we were about 5 years old. We grew up together, and were always distant friends up until high-school. Growing up, we lived in Los Angeles, I knew when I was able to I wanted to move out and leave. I hate it here for many reasons. I moved to Texas when I was 18 and lived there for about 4 years, till some issues happened and I had to move back. 

Tom and I were friendly when I moved out, but never close. When I came back we reconnected, and I felt like I got hit by a truck by how attracted to him I was. He asked me out on a date and we've been lowkey obsessed with each other since. 2 weeks after we got together, i got kicked out of my current house and ended up moving in with his and his family. This was all in beginning of Octover 2019. 

All was well for a while, I had a job at target, and I stream on twitch at night so I was steadily bringing in some money. We didn't have to pay rent at his parents house, so instead we would help clean up around the house and whatever we could do. Eventually I lost my job (I was temporary) and I've been focusing on content instead. 

Bringing it up to current times, about 2 months ago his parents stopped feeding us. They would get fast food alot but never get use anything. They'd get food for there dog but not us. This wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that everytime we would go to cook food, we would get yelled at when we tried to cook, even tho it was our food that we had bought. On top of that issue, I don't feel welcome. Everytime I would leave our room, his dad would glare at me (they say he does that to everyone but 🤷‍♀️) or if I asked his mom for something he would make snide comments about it or roll his eyes. 

At this time, Tom and I talked about moving to Tennessee with my mom. We wouldn't have to pay rent, she would be okay with us eating and finding a job that fits our schedule, it would help me get a car and get on our feet. 

After we talked, he said yes let's move. Originally it was supposed to be in August. So we devised a plan. We do doordash right now to make up for lost income due to Covid. We had to make about 300$ a week to afford a UHaul and gas and all that moving jazz. Tom has a little issue with motivation sometimes, so being that he told me yes let's move i pushed him to work as much as we could and save up fast. 

This entire time, he was telling me he is excited to move and ready, and tired of dealing with the bullshit we had been enduring. About a week or 2 ago we had a falling out with his parents, and I mentioned I wanted to go sooner. After a talk, he said yeah let's go. He was scared to leave his friends, job and family but California has not been good to us so he agreed. We moved up our plan and it was set in motion. 

2 days ago he decided it was time to tell his parents that we were leaving in June. We went over scenarios in our head preparing for it. ( keep in mind, the entire time he was telling me he is ready, and excited to move and all these things). 

When he told them, he was out of the room for 2 hours talking to them. When he came back, all he said was "" I think you should move to Tennessee by yourself for now and we'll talk about me coming along later"" so of course I freaked out. ( I am 100% sure in my heart that this is who I want to be with, who I want to marry and start my life with, no doubt about it.) We talked about it, I mentioned that I don't feel welcome here and that I'd sleep on the street if I had to ( I was being dramatic. I felt like my whole life had just crashed). 

Now- Tom has anger issues. He has never hit me, and I'm sure that he never will but when I said that, he started yelling at throwing boxes and punching boxes in front of him screaming that he needed to leave and get out of here. He ended up running into the living room and having a breakdown. I was crying because he really scared me. He dad came into the room, clenched his fist at me and just looked at me. I mentioned that we were just talking but I could tell his dad wanted to hit me. 

After 20 minutes or so tom came back into our room and apologized and made sure I was okay. I held him for a minute while we cried. I just wanted to make sure he was okay. His mom came into our room and told us to go to the living room and talk. 

When we got out there, she kept saying ""Go visit your mom in Tennessee, and we'll figure out what to do after"" pretty much telling me to leave and not buy a return ticket back. At this point I feel even less welcome there. I feel like I am being pushed out. 

That night, I was scared of Tom and what had happened I decided to stay the night at my brother's. I'm still here now ( its saturday and all this went down on thursday) the plan was to go home yesterday. 

His parents will not let me come home. They are telling him that I am trying to steal him away, and that he's been depressed lately and more stressed. 

He has been stressed because we aren't eating. And I would never try to steal him away ( my family and I don't have a good relationship, so I always encourage him to stay in good light with them). I feel like they are hinting at me not ever coming back, without saying that. They keep telling him I'm stressing him out and that I'm stealing him and is bad for him. I want nothing more than for him to be happy and healthy, and have a good relationship with his parents. 

I found out that he doesn't want to move, and he wants to stay in California and start his life here. Which isn't ideal with me, but I'm willing to stay for him. My dreams aren't area specific, as long as I have internet and weed is legal ( I want to run my own bakery one day). I am more than willing to stay in California for him, because I know in my heart this is who I'm supposed to be with. If he would've just been honest from the start, we wouldn't even be in this issue. 

He told me he didn't want to tell me in fear of me leaving him and moving to Tennessee without him. And I got to be honest that really hurt my feelings to hear. We've always have a good honest and open relationship, and if he would have mentioned that ( when I asked him 10x if he was ready and really wanted to go)  we would've made it work. I would've put up with these issues if it means in a year or so we can get our own place in a different part of SoCal or a different state or something. 

Now, his parents keep saying I'm trying to steal him away, and that's why we were trying to move so soon. When we talked to them in the living room before I left, I felt like I was being attacked and pushed to just leave without them saying it. 

They keep saying "" One more night at my brothers"" and now my brother and I are both scared to assume I won't be allowed back. My brother will not let me stay past Sunday due to work ( he works in the medical field). Which is understandable. I don't have any other family or friends in SoCal that I could stay with. So if I don't get to go back home by Sunday, then I'm moving to Tennessee alone. 

I keep asking Tom what he will do if his parents kick me out, and he just says I don't know. Which to me already feels like he made his decision and is just scared to say it. He came to talk to me in person yesterday, and his dad came with because they didn't want him to see me alone. 

I told him straight up, if the situation was reversed, that I would drop everything to move with him out of my parents place. And come back to Cali or something in a year after we get on our feet. 

All in all, we just want to start our life together. It doesn't seem possible out here right now, but I don't know what to do or how to feel. I'm very numb about this whole situation and I'm just tired of it. 

I'm not trying to make him choose between his parents or I. Like I mentioned, I want him to have a great relationship with them, and I do too. I want to talk with his mom one on one so I can tell her my side instead of them just shipping me off and getting rid of me. 

People of reddit, please help me with advice. I don't want to leave this man, but if we can't even talk without his parents getting involved then I don't know what to do."
"Help me (19M) make sense of my parental situation Hey, this is going to be a rather lengthy post but I'd appreciate if you guys can help me out here

So I'm a single child , 19 yo now and my dad walked out on me and my mom when I was 3 because things were getting really bad between him and my mum, however once he left , he moved to another city and made almost zero effort to be a part of my life,except for the weekly phone call, until I was about 15-16, (I live in India where things are still very patriarchal and the society is very male dominated so that didn't help either), also he had adopted another family over there and often called me by the name of his stepson due to force of habit , so that says a lot.

On top of that he didn't support me financially either , the guy was making more than 3 million INR(Indian currency) a year before taxes and he gave me about 72K a year in the name of child support and reminded me of this on multiple occasions , to put it in some context , 72K a year wasn't even enough to pay my school fee and was basically peanuts , Although he started supporting me financially a bit more(on request) like an actual dad when I turned 15-16, I'll never understand how he got away with that court settlement.Although he has tried to be more involved in my life once I turned 15-16 , just a few months ago,he said and did some stuff that made it evident that he hadn't come to the realisation of the wrongs he had done

Now what I'm confused about is the role of my mom in all this mess , although on one hand she supported me in every way all throughout my childhood and early teens , she was a piece of work herself,she always made me feel guilty about talking to my dad , telling me he's a monster for leaving me and basically being overprotective and checking on every single text/call I had with him , ALTHOUGH I think she might've had good reason to do this , cause I've seen a lot of cases where fatherless kids develop abandonment issues and lack of self confidence amongst other things , so perhaps constantly reminding me that it was my dad's fault and not mine might have helped me dodge those issues and in a way I'm actually thankful that she did that.I do think she overdid it at a lot of points , like threatening to kick me out the house if I talked to my dad and telling me that I'm his son after all and  it's in my blood to be a scumbag.Needless to say things have turned really toxic between for the last 3-4 years and we barely talk (I'm moving out in a couple months)

Now lately in quarantine I've been thinking about the whole mess and although I've mostly put it all behind me , I believe I'd be at more peace with it if I had some sort of closure/judgement.I believe my father was definitely a terrible one and the fact that he made some efforts to be closer to me when I turned 15-16 doesn't really excuse what happened before .I've forgiven him in the sense that I don't harbour any resentment (still working on it though) ,basically accepting and realising that he was a terrible father who didn't know any better and I should stop caring about it now since now all aspects of my life are in my control.

The question that confuses me though is if I should continue to keep taking to him and try to build a better relationship with him now that all those things are a thing of past, although presumably it would be a good thing to repair a bad relation and might help provide me with some financial support when I go to college, I'm really not sure about it, because I feel like what he did was terribly wrong and I don't really need him as I've taught myself everything a father is supposed to, also if things get better between us, he'll end up trying to be 'my father' and I'll never really see him that way.Basically I need some sort of judgement about the whole situation and on what kind of/how bad a father he was and if I'm making him out to be worse/better than he was/is."
"[UPDATE] I accidentally found out my (28M) fiancee (27F) has been creating erotic fan art/fiction for years. I am not judging but when i mentioned it to her, she became furious (i have never seen her so upset). I am really confused. Doing this on a new throwaway because i cannot remember the password to my original throwaway account. 

Original Post is Here: [OP](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g86svn/i_accidentally_found_out_my_28m_fiancee_27f_has/)

She came back after i sent a large apology message, apologizing for laughing at her fan fiction and it was not done out of malice and more out of awkwardness.

We had a long talk about it, i explained i wasn't that comfortable with her keeping such a large amount of her life secret/hidden from me. She also admitted that often times when she was saying she was working late in our home office what she actually meant was she was writing/drawing stuff and just wanted to be left alone.

I told her i had no problem with her hobbies, which made her happy. She also told me that she is so embarrassed because a bunch of it is self inserts of her, and some of it would make me unhappy reading it. 

I asked her to show me, and she eventually agreed. I read some of it and it didn't bother me at all, (imo to me fantasizing about fictional characters isn't a huge deal as it is simply a fantasy and not real).    I asked if some of the things she writes are things that turns her on, and i told her i am willing to try anything at least once. 

Yesterday night she actually sat down next to me, and started writing while i was next to her on the couch, and she didn't seem embarrassed at all anymore. So i guess this is good.

Thank you for your help.

TL;DR; Me and my Fiancee were able to work things out, and she isn't so embarassed anymore about it, and is willing to share with me. Thanks for the advice!"
"cheating or a bad friend? Back in December, my friend, we’ll call her Christy (29f) came over and hung out and stayed the night at my husband (31m) and I’s home. My husband had to leave for work about 11 pm that night, and got home at 3 am. Me (31f) and Christy we’re drinking and I ended up going to bed around 2 am. When my husband got home, Christy was still up, just watching tv in our living room. My husband got some food and sat in our recliner (across the room from Christy) and eventually fell asleep. He woke up around 4 am with Christy on/inside him, completely naked, and his pants and underwear were off. He immediately told her to get off and he left and took a shower and came to bed. The next day, my husband has to work again, so he left by 8 am. Christy couldn’t drive, so she waited for her sister to pick her up at 2 pm. I was just told about this by my husband, because he was nervous to tell me. I have complete trust In him, and we’ve never had trust issues. Christy has always been flirty with him, and she’s like that with all guys. I’m not upset with my husband whatsoever, I don’t know how to handle it with Christy. She doesn’t know that I know about it. Any suggestions on how to handle this?"
"I (27M) told my wife (25F) that she's a bit too affectionate and she toned it down but now I really miss the affection and I don't know what to do? To be clear, she doesn't withhold affection or anything like that it's just that she no longer just randomly comes and cuddles me or touches my hair or whatever. She'll cuddle me in bed and hug me back if I do it first but I really really miss those little things she used to do. I know it's my fault, I pretty much took it for granted and told her she was too affectionate and she stopped cause I asked her but now I want her to be like she used to. I know it's an asshole thing to do, like she's not some trick pony and I know she was hurt when I initially asked her. 

I guess I'm lost on how to communicate this to her without seeming like I'm demanding things. Any insight or advice?"
"Boyfriend liked ex's pic to hurt me So pretty much my (21f) bf (21) liked his exes photo while drunk to ""spite"" me and get back at me for being angry and scared we would break up since we have been arguing a bit more often. I feel stupid, betrayed, and hurt. 

He said he did it and thought he unliked it after about 10 minutes bc he regretted it but he did not unlike it and I saw it while looking at memes on his phone, he does not have many people he follows so posts stay up on his page for awhile. He did not even tell me.

Previously, he lost my trust by jerking off to girls he knew on instagram at the start of the relationship until about a month in. He only told me out of guilt. I asked him to remove all girls with a past of anything, but he continued to follow her because she did not post often enough to notice.

He also admitted he never did this to any other girl, despite me being the most beautiful one (sus).

I feel like I am dumb and that girl must think I am so stupid. We have made some steps, he put me on his instagram as his clear gf after over a year and a half, he is done with drinking, etc. But I feel so fucking dumb even still talking to him. I guess I just want some perspective on if I am the world's biggest dumbass and should get out now or if I am overreacting. Am I young and stupid?

Sorry if anything does not make sense or if more info is needed. I am really hurt and want to stay with him despite knowing I probably should not. Other than these two incidents, he is perfect. Sorry for mobile, have to stay on the DL."
"My mum has stopped being a mum because she is ill? Hi all
So my mum about 2 years ago was diagnosed with Celiac Disease-for those who dont know what this is, basically its food intollerance meaning she now can only eat things which are Gluten Free. 

I know she gets pains and suffers with fatigue, I completely appreciate that. However, over the 2 years she has seriously exaggerated her symptoms, telling anyone &amp; everyone she sees or speaks to how much her ‘life is ruined’ and how ‘even a cancer patient can eat whst they like’ and ‘i cant eat anything and its ruined my life’ and ‘Look at my life how bad it is, I have the worst life because I cant eat what I want’

Over the last year, I’d say she has completely written off her children &amp; her role as a mother. She stays in bed all day saying shes ‘tired &amp; ill’, cant cook for us because ‘she cant stand up for long or her stomach hurts’christ she cant even cut us a watermelon! Saying ‘it will make her tired and ill’ Me,(22) and my brother (16) She never asks how our day was, asks if were ok, when I comfront her about her about this &amp; in anger at her attention seeking I do say why have you written us off? She just says ‘I’m ill I cant deal with your problems’ literally anything I ask, shes like ‘im ill’. I think she thinks were old enough to take care of our own problems but Im still a baby inside, iv been through so much in my life and had to mature quicky and she has never been a mother to me.

She divorced my dad 7 years ago so we only really see him on weekends. The story of her life is literally ‘shes ill &amp; cant eat anything’. Its a fucking food intollerance for goodness sake and shes written off her children because of it. I work part time and am a student, however I am constantly running around her getting her gluten free good because ‘she cant walk around the shops because her feet hurt and it will affect her stomach’ , i have to take her eveyrwhere because she cant ‘drive because of her stomach’ and I basically buy, cook and produce food for my little brother with money I borrow of my dad, or my wage. What kind of mother cant put food on the table?

Am i being too hard on her?"
"I have been flirting with a girl I liked for 2 years now, I dont know if she just wants me as a friend. [HELP!] This girl I have known for a while and I have been texting recently. We used to date in the past but things went very wrong because she heard rumors about things they said I did. We ended in very bad terms and stopped talking. I never stopped loving her haha. After the quarentine I decidided to text her, now we have been talking for a while but I dont know if she just sees me as a friend, she already said that she is not looking for anything serious but it did not seem sincere. Does anyone know a way to know if she likes me or not?"
"Still hurt. Not sure whether to stick it out or end it. The other day he wrote me a sweet note in his journal and handed it to me to read. So that night he went to his dads and I figured I'd leave him a sweet note, thinking it was ok to open his journal, since he wrote me a note in it and handed it to me earlier. 

Opened it and and the first thing I saw was my name. So had to read, which was shitty of me but. He wrote that he was just with me because he's lonely and that he'd be too weak to break up with me. That he sees me more as a comfort than a romantic partner. And that he's not attracted to me anymore and fantasizes about other women a lot. 

I was fucking crushed. 

When he came home we had a long talk about it and how being humans means feeling things and having thoughts you don't agree with, but you can't ignore. That everyone thinks and says things they don't mean when they're angry or depressed. And I get that. But man, reading that felt like a stab to the chest and I'm still shook.

The week before, we had a fight about a similar topic. I won't go into great detail, but the argument ended with him telling me he'd rather watch porn than have sex with me. I stayed the night at a friend's house. 

Since the note, he's verbally expressed that he's happy with me and wants to be with me and loves me and blah blah. But I still feel absolutely worthless. What he wrote completely validated my insecurities. He says he just wrote it when he was mad and that it's not a truth, but I can't get it out of my head. Nothing he says makes it feel better and I don't know what actions he could take to make me feel like he actually values me. 

It's been a week since I read the journal entry."
"I (21F) am in a relationship but I think I am falling in love with somebody else... Not sure what to do I've (21F) Have been with my boyfriend (23M) for 4 years, this is the first real relationship for both of us and we've never been with other people. There are some bumps in our relationships, some things that make me question if we're compatible, but overall a good relationship.

I have been friends with this other man, lets call him Matt, for around a year. We met through mutual friends and I see him often when our friendship groups all get together, for bbq's, birthdays, pub quizzes etc. I've always found him attractive since I met him, and we have great banter and get on incredibly well. Whilst this started as a little crush I thought it was normal and would just go away. But it didn't. Every time I saw him I got more butterflies, more nervous etc. I stopped going to events I knew he would be at because I realised I needed to disconnect from him. After 3 months I thought it would be fine to see him again, and also realised I hadn't seen my friends for a while and I missed them. But this didn't go away. My attraction to him just kept growing stronger. However he had never expressed he liked me so I thought things would just fizzle out as this was one sided and there would never be a temptation to cheat.

Things changed in Dec 2019 when he expressed that he liked me a lot. I have never told him I like him, and I've never told anybody else either. Although a friend of ours has commented that we have good chemistry. Since this, I've seen Matt a few times whilst out and he's been quite flirty. I don't flirt back, but then I don't really reject or stop him flirting either. I know this is terrible, and is classed as emotional cheating, and I feel really shit for it. I literally can't stop thinking about Matt and I'm also beginning to have dreams about him. I am beginning to question my relationship now, and I think maybe my relationship isn't as strong as I thought if I can fall for another man, I'm beginning to notice more cracks and red flags in my relationship. I am beginning to imagine a life without my boyfriend, and I am also now thinking a lot about 'what else is out there'. Very shitty. I know I'm a dick. It's worth noting as well that I can cut ties with Matt but this would also mean I cut ties with a lot of my friends as we are in the same friendship circle.

Basically I just want to know if anyone has been in a similar situation? Is this a normal thing to happen? Should I try and forget about Matt? Any advice or experience please :("
"Would it be OK for me to ask my partner to pay more towards the bills? I hope I explain this right so bear with me if you can.

My boyfriend (36M) and I (33F) have been together for over 4 years and have lived together for at least 3 1/2  of those years. He moved in with me after the lease on his flat came to an end and we figured we were happy enough to move in together even if it might have seemed a little too soon.

We met online and got along straight away. We're both pretty low maintenance and don't make demands of each other. We are quite chilled out and are both happy enough. We have a dog, safe jobs, and his family are wonderful. I lost my mum a couple of years ago and my Dad now lives in a care home on account of a serious stroke but I visit him every other day (except lockdown has meant we have to cope with just talking on the phone now but he's well looked after which makes me feel a lot better tbh).

About a year ago, we started talking about finding a new place to live. I've been saving up a deposit of sorts and buying a house is definitely in my future. We didn't own a house as a kid so having something secure is a big deal to me. I earn quite a bit more than he does and he has alluded to a couple of heavy credit card bills in the past that he's still paying off. Basically we decided that I would cover the rent and bills for the foreseeable so he could focus on paying off his debts so he'll be in a better position to contribute to a house. I completely understand this but I'm now getting a little....antsy is probably not the right word. 

I can afford to cover us both but it does leave me with a smaller amount for spending. I'm a keen saver and don't feel comfortable if I don't have something to fall back on if the worst comes to the worst. I feel like I have worked hard to get to where I am and it's grating on me from time to time that it feels like I can't fully enjoy it as well as saving what I feel comfortable to save. 

I'm starting to feel a bit hard done by and feel awful for saying this. I think, if we split up in the future, he will have got something out of it because he'll have paid off a lot of his debt whereas I won't have benefited as much financially from sharing a home with someone. Am I being a b*tch for feeling like this? Is there a right way to bring this up or am I way out of line? I did agree to the set up originally and think I'll cause issues if I suddenly backtrack...."
"Not wanting to feel obligated to spend time with my moms boyfriend and thinking she puts him before me Sorry in advance if this turns into a rant or gets off topic. My mom has been dating this guy for several years now and after many attempts to spend time with him I still find myself being miserable and uncomfortable around him. I do believe he is a nice guy and treats her very well, but I don't understand why it is so imperative to her that him &amp; I spend time together. I come home pretty often from college (about 30 min away from my house) to spend the weekend which I split between spending time at my dads house and spending time at my moms. I've spent a considerable amount of these weekends spending time with my mom and her boyfriend since he will also spend the weekend. However, as nice as we try to be to each other, he simply annoys the crap out of me. He's one of those guys that feels the need to try to be funny all of the time even though he isn't at all. This includes things such as narrating shows, talking in terrible accents, and teasing people for no reason other than the fact that he likes to hear himself talk. On multiple occasions I've hinted at him to stop and my moms outright told him thats he's being really annoying and he just continues on even longer. When this isn't happening, the conversation between the three of us is just downright stiff and uncomfortable. Due to this, I try to avoid visiting her when I know he is there because to me it just makes more sense to spend that time with my dad if I'm going to be home. She's asked me multiple times, why I can't spend time with him and I repeatedly explain these points to her. I'm fine with her dating him, I just don't understand why she feels like I have to spend so much time with him. Some time into this she began to do things like not telling me he would be there until the last minute which would infuriate me when I found out because it felt like I was trapped when I couldn't change my plans. In my mind, having him there changes my weekend to a relaxing weekend at home to a stressful weekend with a stranger. I know that it is her house and she makes the decisions, but it started to feel like we were getting any quality time together anymore which was really difficult for me because I grew up with really close relationships with my parents. Being home for quarantine the last month or so has somewhat confirmed my fears that our relationship has deteriorated and she would rather spend her time with him. They have been quarantining at their respective houses while I've been at my moms. During this time my mom has barely spent any time with me and we probably talk for a total of 20 minutes a day. When she's done with work she talks on the phone with her boyfriend on and off for the majority of the evening and acts like she has nothing to talk with me about. On top of all this, she has been very critical of me for the last couple years grilling me on how I'm doing in school and how I need to get a job. My parents have never been involved in my grades before and have considered me very accomplished so this is very unusual. This behavior along with her attention always being on her boyfriend makes me believe that she's bored of being a mother and wants to make sure I'm independent as soon as possible so she can move on with her life. Am I being overdramatic or is this something I should confront my mother about in attempt to help our relationship?"
"I’m talking to my tinder match on Instagram, we also voice chat on fortnite and he’s stopped talking to me suddenly? What do I do? So I matched with a guy on tinder and we moved our conversation to Instagram which consists of paragraphs and we message literally everyday. He has sometimes commented saying we should meet after quarantine is over and I’ve agreed. I asked him if he would like to play fortnite with me and voice chat and he agreed. We have played twice now and it’s so nice to talk to him. Yesterday I replied to his paragraph and then suggested a quick game, he agreed (without replying to the whole paragraph) that he would be up for a quick game. We stayed up till 1am playing followed by a quick bye. It’s now the following evening and he hasn’t popped up saying hi, or even replied to the paragraph I wrote yesterday. He’s been online as he has seen my recent Instagram story. What should I do? I know I could easily just say hi to him first, but I don’t wanna look too eager seeing as I sent the last message. What should I do? We normally talk all day lol. I’m a 25/f and he’s 24"
"My boyfriend (33M) is worried that I (26F) made an Instagram He said that Instagram causes fights and he said I would be mad to find ex’s photos on his Instagram. 

He also won’t follow me or ask for my username. 

He says “ oh I barely use that anyway” but is on it 24/7 when we’re together. 

Why is he being weird about me making one?"
"I(45F) found a file on my sons(21M) computer which had details on what all we had done to him and audio clips of me and my husband(50M) shouting at him. I am really scared and don’t know what to do , please help me. It feels like I am living with a serial killer. He is currently staying with us because of the corona virus. He was visiting us and because he needed some documents. And due to the lockdown he was not able to go back to his home. I told him to take a bath and and to tell him to give his clothes to me so that I could wash his clothes. But he was already in the Bathroom by then. I saw his computer and it had my name on it. It was a word file which had the name - “REMEMBER NEVER FORGET” , the first page had my name and in bullet points all the stuff I had done to him, like the first point was beat me ( I only ever raised my hand to discipline him and as a parent it is my right to do so ) and several other stuff like that only worse. I was shocked to say the least , how can somebody write about their mother like that and hold it against them. It also had my husbands name and it elaborated on the same topic. I am extremely shocked at this , he is not the kind of kid to do this. He is always in his room and doesn’t talk to us a lot. He’s a quiet and nice kid. It feels like I am living with a serial killer. I don’t know what to do , please help me. My head is all over the place right now sorry if the text was all over the place too."
"I hooked up with my friends gf and she’s going to tell him ok here’s the thing. My friend Tyler and I have been friends for a really long time, he’s my brother and we live together and he’s an awesome guy. I really fucked shit up I know that. Me and his girlfriend Haley got along pretty well I thought she was cool and I kinda liked her to be honest but he’s my bro and I would never date her. Couple weeks ago Tyler wasn’t there and they had a fight and Haley came over and we were hanging out and she came onto me she made the first move and we fucked. Honestly I just hadn’t got laid in a while and I was desperate that’s the only reason why I did it. They are fine now and together and she keeps telling me that she had fun and she likes me and all this shit and I told her that there’s no way we will ever date and to just leave me alone and stop talking about that and forget it and she said she’s gonna tell Tyler we hooked up. I don’t know what to do .I know I fucked up but I don’t want him to hate me. I feel fucking ashamed about what I did now. She’s just some girl but he’s crazy about her he’s gonna fucking kill me  and we’ve been friends forever its not fair she’s doing this. She won’t listen to me I told her to please shut her mouth and don’t tell anyone because I was drunk and i didn’t know what I was doing and she’s not listening"
"Husband shopping 28/Never married/No children / have been single for about 3 years. Haven’t had sex for about 5. I’ve been so busy with pretty much “everything “ building my career and spent nearly 10 years (getting that degree...higher education) Because I don’t want to look back be 35 and still in college. Also I have this mantra “no man should tell or ask me where is the money “ .

I’m in healthcare and work long hours..I’ve dated around when I was like 22-25. Nothing serious. I’ve met men from all walks of life. The jerk, the good guy , the rain check type of man, the wannabe alpha and men with hall pass...As a result . I know every little game they all play. It’s all played out. Now, I don’t entertain or talk at all. No dinner invites and no movie nights...just not into it. Not that they’re bad....or I’m attracting the wrong guys because I’ve met very nice guys but they aren’t just for me

Now...it’s really time for me to find that man. The issue is I’m having a hard time needing and wanting a man. The guy has to feel needed and because I’ve been single for quite some time ....it’s hard for me to change that now. Also I know what I want...I don’t have anything to do with single dads, smokers, excessive tattoo and he has to be college educated.  I truly want someone who is just like me , in all levels and aspect or areas . We’re equal. Or you’re way “more” or above me.......I know it’s not everything. But how can I connect with someone ? If we don’t have anything in common ? I need someone I can look upto and be proud of. Like attracts like .... Beauty is just a skin deep. 

I live in the South.Looks wise...I’m mixed Latin/Hispanic look (tanned, dark hair ,) I travel 2 times a year ,One overseas. Life is good but something is missing. I’m running but I’m not living :) 

TLDR; husband shopping ..Never settling !"
"I [26M] want to make my relationship with my sister [28F] public but not sure how I am not a native English speaker, but I will try my best.

Off the bat, I am in a consensual romantic relationship with my sister and we are very in love with each other. We do not plan to have children, so please let us not discuss that. We left our home country (Belarus) because our relationship would have been illegal there. We have been together for 1 year in Belgium where we are legal and have been very very happy. I am deeply in love with my sister and I want to spend the rest of my life with her. If I can, I want to marry her. I want to make it public because I want to feel proud, not ashamed, of our lifestyle choices.

Our problem is that we have been hiding our relationship from our family for so long. They are all back in our home country and are very traditionalist. I cannot overemphasize how conservative they are about this. I asked my father and brother about it in a hypothetical manner and their answer was disturbingly violent. 

I am wondering if this COVID-19 situation is an appropriate time to tell my family through Zoom. Or should I do it in person? Should I even let my family know at all? I know they will be disappointed to say the least, but I want them to understand our love. Also, I need a way to calmly explain it to my friends and co-workers in Belgium and elsewhere (if they ever ask about us). Please, many thanks for your advice.

Side question to Canadian redditors: would our relationship be frowned upon over there as well? We love Canada and want to move there someday as it seems very tolerant, but not sure if the laws will change in that direction."
"I (27/m) have been with my gf (27/f) for 5 years. We've had a couple of break ups in between. During those breakups I had sex with this other girl multiple times, and it is the best I have ever experienced, incredible sexual chemistry. Should I leave my gf and try something new? Each time we have broken up I always go back to the other girl, and it is amazing every single time! I find myself thinking about her often and what we would get up to together, for days on end I cannot get her out of my mind. My current gf doesn't know about her, and I've tried unsuccessfully to repeat the antics experienced with the other girl with my current gf, but it's just not the same.

In 5 years we've broken up long term twice, and during them I've slept with the other girl 5/6 times each, I look forward to the next time more than i do with my gf.

I fear that leaving my current gf I'd be losing out on a great future, shes fantastic but that missing aspect is something I think will eventually grow uncontrollably and I'd always know what I'm missing out on.

I adore my current gf and everything about her, apart from the fact I know the sex is better with someone else. 

Any advice? Has anyone been in this situation before? Did you regret not making any changes when you had the chance..."
"Do you think this guy is her (20F) boyfriend? I've posted this a couple times now cause I can't get the answer I'm looking for. Literally all I want to know is if this guy sounds like her boyfriend or not. I don't need a rant or anyone telling me I'm ""in the friend zone"". 

I'm (21M) into this girl I met at school in January. I kind of became her friend, but not a close friend. We're sort of just school friends but a little more than that cause sometimes we text about non school related things. She hasn't mentioned anything about having a boyfriend, but that could just be because we haven't talked about our personal lives much.

I've been following her on Instagram since early February. She has no feed posts about a boyfriend, but there's this dude she posts on her story every once in a while. She's probably posted him like....5 times in the 4 months I've been following her? So not a lot but often enough. One post was a ""one year ago today"" post so I know she's known him for at least a year. She's never said anything romantic about him but she seems really comfortable with him and he's an attractive dude. He tagged her in his story once too and she reposted it. There was also this video where they were joking with this older guy who seemed like he was either her dad or his dad, so I guess they're comfortable with each other's families. One time she posted a picture of his dog at 2:00 am. She went over a month with no mention of him but she just posted him again the other day.

I feel like she'd make it known if this dude was her boyfriend, right? Like he'd probably be on her feed or she'd say something to me (I think she knows I like her) or she'd post him more often than just every few weeks? Please don't tell me to ""just ask her"" because I can't, that'd be super weird given the nature of our relationship. I need other people's opinions because I want to make a move but I don't know if this guy's her boyfriend. What does he sound like to you?"
"Should I ask my female Chinese friend if she can set me up with any cute female friend of hers? Just wondering if asking about it is rude. I have a bit of a crush on her but unfortunately she already has a boyfriend. Might not be completely one sided though, considering she did apparently not want me to know she already had a boyfriend among other things. In any case I do quite like really petite Asian girls like her so maybe she could introduce me to a friend of hers? 

Or is it rude to ask that considering she might have a bit of a thing for me?"
"BIRTHDAY SURPRISE I want to provide my girlfriend with the best birthday gift ever. My girlfriend does not know when she was born. She fled her birth country in the Middle East(will not reveal for privacy) when she was born, because her family was being hunted by terrorist. Given these extreme circumstances when she was born, my ""girlfriend"" does not know when she was born. She is unaware of the date, month, and can't even estimate the time of year of her birth. The only clue she has to when she was born is that it was ""cold outside."" That is my only lead. So when it begins to snow or consistently gets cold outside, I'll surprise her with a birthday party. It doesn't feel right, because I can only imagine the feeling of not knowing when you were brought into this world. 

Could someone direct me to resources that I could exploit or the correct subreddit to receive advice on this matter?"
"My (19F) mother (49F) is trying to guilt trip me for moving in with my BF (21M) So me and my BF have been living together for over 6 weeks (just before the UK lockdown was put into place). We were talking about living together before all this happened anyway so it was an easy decision to make for both of us. 
However, (this is where it goes all Disney style; think of mother Gothel from tangled) now that lockdown measures look like they may relaxed soon my mum has been hinting at me to come back home “where I belong”. 

We had a lengthy chat about it today and it all went terribly wrong, I explained to her that I’m an adult and am capable of making my own choices but I still respect her opinion. She then had a huge rant that this will cause nothing but problems and will most likely cause my BF to get sick of me after a few months (he’s adamant that won’t happen as he would already know by this stage anyway if I was a crazy b*tch). She told me she is not happy for me and never will be. I want to have a good relationship with her but I don’t think that will ever be possible if she can’t respect me (or at least be happy for me). 


Honestly not sure what to do as this has all been made harder by Covid-19, is there anything I can do or is it a lost cause? Am I in the wrong for wanting happiness?"
"Should I start taking to him again? I met this guy on tinder we had an instant connection he was funny and made me feel super comfortable. We snapped for 2 months before we actually met because I was looking for a relationship and he wasn't. 2 months in he said that maybe he was open to a relationship but wasn't sure. Anyway we met hooked up and became fwb because he didn't want anything serious. The first 2 months of us hooking up was fine and normal we snapped and talked a lot. 

Then winter break starts we talk a lot over break and spring semester starts and hes being weird snapping me less and less towards the end he would  open my snaps and texts not respond and send one snap just to keep our streak which was pointless to me. I asked him about it and told him that if he didn't want to talk anymore its fine i didn't want to annoy him if he wasn't into me anymore. He said its fine, he was just stressed with school which i understand but it continued for another month. I was kinda getting annoyed by talking maybe once a week for a little and not hooking up at all. And that's when I was like fuck I might be getting feelings for him. This was the first week of March. I had invited him over to drink with me and my friends later that day but he blew me off this whole semester so I didn't think he would show. He ended up coming over towards the end when it was just me and one friend I was super drunk. Anyways my friend leaves we cuddle for a bit and hook up and he leaves. Looking back i shouldn't have knowing I was getting feelings but I wasn't thinking that night. 

We go to spring break and corona cancels the semester he barely snaps me and thats when I'm like fuck it and confess. I tell him that we should stop talking for a month or 2 and he says that it would be a good restart for us. 

Well now its been 2 months and I realized I'm very picky with who I talk to and I don't think I have feelings for him but I don't know if I should go back to talking to him/if he would want to/how to go about it. I don't think I want to start talking to him just because I'm bored, like I genuinely liked talking to him before but idk if now is the right time either."
"Should I (21F) stop being friends with my best friend (21F) over her inappropriate friendship with my boyfriend (21M)? We are all 21. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 11 months and he has been close friends with my best friend for three years now. He had always had a crush on her, and told me that in school when we were friends. He even asked her out, and she said no. They remained friends and began hanging out together at his house getting drunk.

Fast forward to when we began dating. I always knew they were close but I didn't know just how friendly they were with each other. Once every few weeks, they would hang out at his and get drunk, he would essentially ignore my messages for hours on end (which is respectful imo, but when we would hang out he would constantly be replying to other peoples messages) and he would invite me over after when he was really wasted.

I was uncomfortable with their relationship, told them both this, and neither really listened. Turns out, whilst they're together, the talk constantly turns sexual i.e. what's your kissing technique (he showed her on his hand), what am I like in bed, sexual likes/dislikes. She was a virgin at this time so it was basically my boyfriend sharing intimate details. He told her I don't like some sexual things (anal/getting eaten out), I'm not into sending nudes, really private stuff which should be kept between us imo. The talk turning sexual really makes sense to me as when we all hang out (a group of 3 girls) she constantly talks about sex. No idea why. She also turns the conversation towards her often when they're together, he told me, asking if she's pretty in his eyes and if it's weird that he might be sleeping with the same person for the rest of his life. Yes, this is the drunk talk they partake in. 

She recently got a bf, so I thought the private one-on-one drinking sessions would stop, but turns out her boyfriend's fine with it (I think she alters the truth a little) and I had finally had enough with it all. I told them both that if they had any respect for me then this whole situation should have ended when we started dating. He agreed to stop the private meetings in his house. I asked her if she would be okay with me going to her boyfriend's house and doing all the things she's done. She has turned it around on me and said she didn't know any of this bothered me (which is bullshit as we even met up for coffee to discuss it??). I spoke to my bf about this in around February and he told her so I know she knows. She has since made herself out to be the victim with our closest friends/her parents/boyfriend and I'm being seen as just an insecure gf who can't stand her bf knowing other girls, which is just so harsh and untrue. I feel like I'm being gaslighted by her. I think she enjoys the attention he gives her. She's honestly making me feel like I'm in the wrong for having a problem with this. Should I stop being friends with this girl as she is spreading total lies about me?"
"Is my mum wrong for calling me a liar? Ok so...My (16f) parents are divorced, I live with my mum but I rarely see my dad as he lives 4 hours away. I have an on off relationship with him and sometimes talk to him, or i argue with him and we end up not talking for months. My dad is pretty much a narcissist and my mum hates him as he was very manipulative and horrible to her when they were together. In the past he has said a few weird things to me/done a few weird things which I will list below:

-took me to a hotel once, there was only one bed so I told him to sleep on the floor and he agreed, woke up and he was in the bed with me with his arm round me (I don't know my dad that well so found this a bit odd) 

-was on a day out with him, we were talking about the millennium, I asked him what he did that night and he told me he had s*x with my mum (told my mum about it and she said that was a lie so idk why he said it like wtf) 

- when I was 13 I called him, asked where he was and he said ""up your bum"" 

-asked me if he should get a really young girlfriend (wtf?) 

-said I look ""very grown up and have a nice figure""

So all in all my dad's a bit creepy (he's said and done other weird things but I cba to go into it all). I had told my mum about all these incidents, she said what he was doing was wrong and i stopped talking to him for a while. I have 2 sisters and they don't talk to him because I told him the stuff he was saying and we pretty much all think he's odd. 
Recently I started talking to him again because although he's weird I missed him cos he's my dad and I felt bad for not talking to him. My mum says that she's OK with me talking to him if I would like to, but I find that every time I talk to him she gets mad?! 
So basically she saw in my messages I was talking to him again and she got kinda mad with me and was asking if I was lying about the creepy stuff he's done and saying she doesn't believe me because she doesn't get why I would talk to him if I think he's such a creep and was insinuating that it's my fault my sisters don't talk to him for telling everyone about it. This really upset me because ofc I'm not lying. Was that wrong of her or should I not talk to him?"
"Moving to another state away from family, after they moved here for me? So I moved to this state five years ago for a job. My wife and I.  My sister (40) moved here to be closer to me when she was out of work and don’t have any reason to stay where she was. My mother and stepfather also plan to move this way once they retire in a few years..obviously to be near me, my sister and my kid.  Well, my wife and I have been thinking of relocating to a ‘better’ state. We desire warmer weather, better politics, better scenery.  

How would I even navigate this with my sister and mother??"
"How can I get rid of my ex-boyfriend? I don't know where to post and ask this, but I am scared and need help. I have an ex boyfriend with whom I have not been together for almost three years, I was the one who broke up as I wasn't happy in that relationship anymore. He said that he would always wait for me and even talked about the idea of suicide indirectly if I was to left him one day. He has been studying in another city but as he is about to graduate, he will come back here, and because of Corona virus, he is here with his family right now, so I am sometimes scared of going out as he knows my address.

I blocked him everywhere and even deactivated my accounts not to allow him create fake ones and disturb me. He hasn't been disturbing me till last summer when he reached me with fake account and I blocked him almost pleading him not to disturb me anymore, a couple of months later this he wanted to add me as his friend on instagram. Then after a couple of months again he contacted a close friend of mine, with whom I was not speaking at the time, and started complimenting me and how he was sorry to lose me and how he missed me so she shouldn't do the same mistake, indirectly causing me and my friend to get back together, but I think he just used her good intentions to use her as a mediator between us.

Tonight the same thing happened, he contacted my friend and asked her to help him to make me his girlfriend again all the time saying he loves me and he has changed since the relationship. She sent me the things he said and as I was already disturbed, now I am almost shaking with anger and a creepy feeling. He thinks that I have a boyfriend and if I break up with him, we should get back together. He is probably drunk as his writing implies this. But I don't think that his love is genuine, because even though he thinks that I love another man and that I would be unhappy with him, he still insists on being with me. I have had enough and don't want a psycho to stalk me anymore. I was sorry to hurt him once but now I feel horrified.  

What can I do to get rid of him? Should I warn him and threaten him with involving the police, or should I ignore him? If I ignore him, would he see this as hope? If you can help me, I would be so so so happy. Thank you so much."
"My older sister likes telling me what to do So (16F) my older sister (18F) tells me what to do a lot and would get mad at me when I tell her no. Sometimes she would yell at me. And recently I just started doing what she says because I don’t want to be yelled at or be giving a nasty look by her anymore. And just an FYI we both still live with our mom (parents are divorced) and most of the time my mom will take her side which pisses me off. 

The thing is though I suffer with severe social anxiety and a part of my anxiety is that I’m afraid of conflict and confrontation.

So my question is, should I wait until she moves out (she moves out for college in August) or should I get the balls to talk to her?"
"I [20M] dont't know if I should break up with gf [21F] Please forgive my english it's bad I know.

We have been together for little over 3 years now. She is my first big relationship so I need the advice. We got together in HS. We started off as friends and ended up dating then it became a relationship. I thougth that this wasn't going to last long because after we graduated she had a gap year while I moved and started uni. The LDR worked fine because I was able to come back to our hometown almost every weekend. In HS before our relationship I had a really good female-friend. We would sit next to each other as we had a good male-female friendship. My girlfriend (gf) and female-friend (ff) never really liked each other but as soon as we got together my gf would not want me to be around my ff. My ff, my gf and me all ended up at different universities. After my gf's gap year we were able to move in together because we studied in the same city and my parents had a flat downtown so it was all perfect.

The FF and I kept in touch trough social media, we would send each other memes but thats it. Last summer we had a small party at my FF's house with some former HS classmates. My GF didn't like any of that so I had to cancel any plan that involved my FF. Since last winter we have been talking more and more about stuff and I have been thinking about her more frequently. Since this quarantine started we have been talking even more. She opend up to me and we discussed her previous relationships and that she is still head over heals for her EX. Sometimes the chat would get a little flirty but she would always stop and then joke about it and then flirt again 10 minutes later. We even talked about some real private things. One time she mentioned that she trust me 100% and that's why she had drunk texted me before even when she and I were in relationships.

So here is how I feel: I think I started catching feelings for my FF way before corona and I think I've been falling out of love with my current GF. I dont want to hurt my GF's feelings, I don't want to be a douchebag either. She really does love me and that's why I don't want to break up yet because she would be devastated and the finals are coming up for this semester and it would be too much stress for her.  
I feel like my FF is giving me mixed signals as she would talk about living life to the fullest while we are young and be a little flirty. Then she would talk about how much she misses her EX and wants to get back together with him. \[Her ex was her first big relationship, they broke up more than a year ago. He has a girlfriend right now.\] I genuinely think that she is talking to me because of the corona lockdown but at the same time I don't want to belive it.

I don't want to break up because I think we would get together with my FF. I want to break up because I think my love is fading towards my GF. Sure it might be because of my FF.

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont know what should I do and its affecting my productivity as I can only think about this. I would like to hear someones opinion on this beacause sometimes it makes me sick to my stomach that I'm falling out of love with somebody who is in love with me. But at the same time I'm falling for somebody who most likely wont ever be in love with me and is only playing me."
"Should I (25F) stay with my boyfriend (26M)? My boyfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 years. He said that he hopes we can get married but he wants to see how the next couple years go. My biological clock is ticking and I think that if he wants to marry me, he should know by now since we live together and know pretty much everything about each other. I also think that if we did run into problems later down the line, we would work them out together if we actually wanted to be together instead of keeping breaking up as an option. However, I'm confused because he still says he hopes we can get married. Should I stay with him?"
"Ex (28F) broke up with me (30M) because she ""lost the excitement"" and thought of me as a friend. Help me understand cause I'm so hurt. Long story short, we started dating around the end of September last year, had a lot of fun together and did a lot. End of March she told me she lost the excitement but couldn't explain it. I asked when she started feeling like this and she said about two weeks ago, which would be around when the Covid lockdown happened everywhere and we couldn't do dates out or anything anymore. She insisted it wasn't me or that I was the problem, but she was unable to explain anything else or at the very least, refused too. We agreed to give it a few weeks and see if anything might change, which in hindsight was clearly a mistake, but that's what we thought of. I did a nice romantic date the following weekend and we both really enjoyed it and we ended the night on a goodnight kiss and things seemed like they might be getting better.

After that she got busy with school, some home stuff and we just weren't able to make plans properly for about three weeks. We spoke in that time but I did most of the initiation but she would occasionally text me or something. Anyway, at the end of April, I planned a date night for us (which ended up not really happening because the ideas I had got canned because of weather issues) and she came over and we had a super chill and really fun night. At the end of the night she didn't seem to want to leave, which I was hopeful meant she was feeling better. Turns out she was just waiting for the right time to tell me that she wanted to end the relationship because she didn't feel any different. No matter what I asked her as her reason for why she felt like this, she couldn't answer. She kept saying it wasn't me or anything but that she started thinking of me only as a friend... somehow. Again, I just wanted something to go off of as to why this happened and she just couldn't say anything. She kept saying she was usually good with describing how she feels but she just couldn't this time. The closest thing she came to was saying that maybe the timing wasn't right (which seems weird cause nothing seemed wrong like just a few weeks prior) and her possibly moving in the future and that she never thought of me in that, but if she was so adamant to herself about moving and this has been on her minds for months and months, then tell me then and not make me feel like this is gonna be something long term. Her not saying anything else just makes me blame myself and I can't help it.

Anyway, she was pretty resolute in this and we ended it there but I told her that despite how sad and frustrated I am that she was an amazing person. She started getting sad around that time but nothing was gonna change this.

I'm absolutely fucking **crushed** about this. I fell in love with her (which I never told her but was going to soon) and this has been the hardest thing I've had to deal with. I've gone through breakups before and it was never this hard or never hurt this much. It all felt so sudden. Nothing at all seemed wrong until she told me at the end of March and it's just utterly flabbergasting how someone just suddenly changes their entire mind about things so quickly. Our sex life was good, we laughed and had fun. It just feels so weird to me and I feel like she suddenly didn't even like me as a friend or something; that's how sudden it was. To her it might not be so sudden, but to me it's like a 180. 7 months together and then within two weeks and she's suddenly thinking of me like a friend.

I don't even know what I'm looking for posting this but I'm just so hurt. I felt like this is girl was the one. She is absolutely incredible and I was ready to go anywhere and everywhere with her. I saw a long term future and to have my heart ripped out and crushed hurts so. fucking. much. and I feel so blindsided by it. Like, her inability to answer why she lost her excitement just feels so strange to me. Like it's just not honest or something.

I want her back so much it hurts but I know that won't happen so now I'm trying to understand my feelings and I'm struggling with the idea of trying to be friends with her because I don't want the last seven months of our time together to mean nothing and she was so much fun, you know? But I'm so hurt by this that I really don't know if I ever want to go through this dating process again and possibly getting feels for someone cause in the back of my mind, I fear this again. I can't take it. 

Anyway, I just don't know how to process this. Anyone else done this to their boyfriend / girlfriend and why? What caused it?

TLDR: Ex suddenly lost feelings and ""excitement"" but didn't really provide a reason why and kept dodging the question as to what lead to this. Broke up with me. I'm struggling to understand and process it. Lost the girl of my dreams and I feel dead inside and broken. Help me understand it and make me feel like not all hope is lost for me cause I feel useless."
"Wife [25F] does not find me [31M] attractive anymore. We've been married for 2 years, for a total of 6 years of relationship.

We used to have sex all the time. Ever since we got married, the cuddles, kisses, hugs etc mostly continued, but the sex just kinda... stopped. Now we just have sex once or twice a month at most.

We've talked about it a lot, and she says she would like to want to have sex, but just doesn't feel like it. When I've asked, she says she finds me attractive only 'sometimes', which I think means 'hardly ever'.

I haven't changed much physically or emotionally. Together we've identified some things that I could work on emotionally, and I've been seeing a therapist to help me do so. We've also done some sessions with a relationship therapist. I've been working to improve things, especially concerning social anxiety and insecurity. She acknowledges that things are indeed improving, but I'm not seeing any improvement on the sex side of things.

I'm trying to learn how I could get her to feel like having sex again. Any attempts at making things interesting, or getting her in the right emotional state, kinda hit a brick wall. As soon as I make any advances such as touching her intimate areas, it's immediately met with rejection, apart from that once per month. She also almost never really initiates. This has been an issue from the very start of our relationship, which I have brought up at times.

It feels like I'm out of options. Do I continue therapy, and fight for our marriage, hoping things will improve at some point? It's not like our relationship is a complete wasteland, but I do miss the sex quite a bit. I'm not sure what to expect moving on..."
"Is it normal not to talk to your SO and not care to? I (23F) am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (26M) and we’ve been together for roughly 5 years. We are normally very social with each other throughout the day and try to find at least one thing to do together a day when our schedules allow it. We’ve both lost our jobs because of COVID and now have a ton of free time. In the past, we would’ve spent this time binge watching shows or playing games nonstop, but lately we’re really distant. I’m not sure how he feels about it, but I haven’t really cared to try to do things with him and haven’t felt too bothered if we only talk for a few minutes a day. He hasn’t pushed to do much together either and has been slow to respond to messages. We aren’t in a bad place by any means, this is just a weird dynamic we haven’t had over the years. Is this a normal part of a long term relationship?"
"Please help me People of reddit I need some advice, I’m 18 and I am very into this girl I’ve been talking to for a while, the only thing holding us is back is that she strongly supports democrats and I support republicans. I am pretty open to what she thinks but it’s not likewise, what are some things that republicans and democrats can come to an agreement on?"
"I(25F) told my boyfriend(42M) that I hate him. Am I a fool to want to make it work? I know we both have our own issues. This is the first time I’ve ever exploded like this.

It started when I realized he needed very hardcore things to get him off, threesomes, him watching me be with multiple people, anal/prostate stimulation, him having sex with men but claiming he’s not bi, taboo porn, etc. He’s messaged and purchased material from cam girls he knew while we were together but stopped doing that (that I know of) when I told him I wasn’t ok with it. He also had affairs while he was with his ex wife. One of his ex flings extorted him for lots of money, and he’s also paid for sex before.

He was reliant on porn &amp; had “death grip” so in our 9 months together, he rarely finished from me. And it hurt my self esteem and I love finishing with the person I love. He said he was going to get help, bought a self-help book on addictions to read, and said he was going to stay away from porn and masturbating.

For 3 nights in a row, he was getting hard but couldn’t finish when we got physical. The third night, he messaged me and asked if I could come over because he was turned on. He then proceeded to ask if he could get himself off without me there even though I was going to be there in only an hour. 

I was so sad and hurt. I initially sat down with him calmly and said I couldn’t do it anymore especially since he didn’t lift the book he bought even once, and didn’t try to find a therapist. He said that I never loved him because I would be there for him. I told him I couldn’t help him if he couldn’t help himself and at this point I was so upset he would say I didn’t love him. Then? He said he was in pain because he didn’t cum in three days. I was in shock. I told him 3 days? You’re pathetic. And I told him I hated him and got my stuff and left. He blocked my number and is dropping off some more things at my moms. He is also telling my mom that I hurt him so bad that he would’ve rather me hit him..

I am so hurt. I wish we could still be together. Maybe I’m a fool but how do I proceed to get over this? 

TL;DR: I believed my boyfriend is a sex addict. I told him I hate him but now want to get back together with him."
"My wife (33F) and I (32M) had a huge argument, need your advice.... Hi everyone,

My story is long so thanks so much in advance for taking the time to read. It's not the most interesting issue but any advice or comments would be welcome.

My wife currently lives in the Philippines and her job is to teach English to Russian students through an online company. She really likes her students because they're very kind, loyal and giving. She's known them for several years. After the quarantine is lifted, she told me she will travel to Russia, meet all of her students, even stay over at some of their places and tour around. She wants to stay there for a month and I support her decision to. Plus I'm in the US so I can't stop her anyway.

If you're wondering why we are currently separated, it's a long story but after wedding, I came back to the US to work and save up so I can move over there and live a more comfortable life financially. We have stayed separated for roughly 3 years for solely that reason though I have visited her every now and then to keep in touch. Our plan is to settle down in the Philippines sometime early next year, as we already have our home construction in process there.

Anyway, we just had a huge argument, because she told me she'll travel to Russia once a year if she can. I am good with her going this year after the quarantine is lifted but once a year in addition to that? Why? I was a little dumbfounded, because not long ago, I told her my desire to travel to Europe together sometime in the near future, to which she replied ""sure, but not anytime soon"".

I am like ""Why? You don't want to travel anytime soon with your husband before having kids because we would be too busy, but touring Russia by yourself once a year just to meet students/friends is ok?""

I said ""Let's go to Russia together once every few years then if you must insist"". I'd like to meet and greet her students too, but she refused, citing her desire to get away from her relatives and enjoy life.

I asked her to consider my opinion too and prioritize us as family. But she just kept saying it's her decision and that she doesn't care about me or her parents (who oddly tend to side with me on almost everything). She then accused me of being a control freak. She said she still supports me but needs some of her private time too.

I'm not a control freak like those that spy on other's phones or demand curfews. In fact, I'm the opposite and I've always given her freedom but I have my limits too. I don't want her to travel once a year on her own when I want to have kids and we'll be busy. Heck, ""we're going to be busy"" was the very reason she said we can't travel as a couple anytime soon but why does she rationalize going to Russia once a year then?

She told me to leave her if I can't accept her desire to enjoy life the way she wants. She said I need to learn to be a man and be independent. She's long scolded me for that. That's sort of how the fight ended as of now.

So here are my questions:

1. How would you resolve this? I'm so upset right now as I type this, but I can't visit her obviously due to the lockdown. She refuses to pick up calls and is giving me the my way or the highway attitude.
2. Am I unreasonable to advise that visiting a foreign country once a year is too frequent? Am I being a control freak by opposing her yearly pleasure? Heck, when we were not married yet, I flied over from US to the Philippines just to see her once or twice a year max even when I didn't have much savings.  We are doing well financially now but that can't justify spending money so casually like that. There is no jealousy in me but what's so special about her friends that she needs to visit them once a year by herself and spending our hard-earned money?

She's a really kind-hearted person. But after getting married, her patience with me in general has gotten worse. And to make matters worse, she's suffered from depressions in the past. Losing her most beloved cat just several days ago didn't help. I can't tell if I'm slowly losing her love.

Any input would be appreciated."
"My 23M mother’s friend is trying to set me up with her friends daughter 24F. What should I say to initiate the first conversation that wouldn’t be weird? Title says it... My mother’s friend is trying to set me up with a girl that she thinks would he a good match for me. I added her on fb and she accepted, and apparently thinks I’m attractive, but I don’t know what to say that would be best to open the conversation?"
"Me (20M) and my girlfriend (18F) are okay, but I always feel like I'm putting in more effort. So, I have a girlfriend whom I've been dating for a little over 6 months now. It's been going great, I see a future with her. We have quite different personalities (I'm social and outgoing and she's pretty quiet, reserved). I think it's nice because we kind of balance each other out and bring out other sides of each other. But lately, I just feel like I've been putting in more effort than her, whether it be little things like the way she says things or the fact she doesn't respond to me for 3 hours but she's active on instagram. We have never been a couple that messages constantly, and I don't want us to become that, but I want her to want to talk to me at least more than once every 3 hours. And it seems like the less effort she puts in, the more I overthink it and start to worry.

Any advice on how to approach the idea that I would like more effort without sounding overbearing and controlling and needy?"
"GF (26F) and me (28M) are on a break but has made contact on Social Media TLDR; she has had panic attacks and anxiety due to the COVID-19 things and is staying almost completely isolated, and said that she wanted to put a pause on things because she wasn't doing well mentally with everything. I say alright, let her know I'm here for her, and to do what she needs to do for her mental health.

Fast forward a week with no contact, she comments on something I posted on social media.

I want to respect her boundaries, but also just want to re-iterate that I've got her back, and by her posting on my shiz, it doesn't directly seem to indicate she's ready to go back at it again. Is it wrong to just reiterate that? I also don't want to come off clingy or needy (because I'm not, I wasn't doing too well before, but now I'm doing LOADS better)"
"My boyfriend [26M] has low self esteem and I'm [26F] not sure how to help I've been with my boyfriend for 6 months, before that we were close friends and lived together (still live together now) so I guess our relationship moved quite quickly.  


I have so much fun with him, he makes me feel so beautiful and reinforces so much good in my life. However, at times he can take what I say/do (or don't say/do) badly or the wrong way and ends up in a ""spiral"" of saying sorry or feeling like he's in the wrong. 

I've explained that he doesn't need to apologise and that we can trust each other because we love each other, therefore he shouldn't feel guilty for small things (e.g. making a loud noise with a plate, using the 'wrong' cleaning solution etc.) because they don't matter and they're not bad or wrong.

Not sure if I'm assuming that his low self esteem (he regularly says he is useless/bad/wrong etc.) is why he feels like he needs to apologise, but it feels like it might be contributing?

It's starting to get to a point where I end up a bit frustrated at our conversations that go round in circles with me reassuring him he isn't to blame, then him thinking I'm pissed off with him and blaming himself and the cycle continues...I'm not sure how best to help. I definitely want to stay in the relationship because he brings me so much joy and builds me up - I just want to be able to do the same for him...help?"
"My sister could be getting ghosted My sister (F14) is in a long distance relationship with someone I call BT (boytoy, just a fun nickname with no meaning. He's 15). And I'm f16. At the start it was fine, BT seemed like a nice kid and I was heavily involved since I recommended them knowing each other better before getting into a relationship. He wanted my approval and we got along so he would message me when he was worried about my sister, and I'll check up with him if my sister is worried. Well, right now she's worried. 

They primarily message on snapchat and last night they were just having a convo about how BT wanted to marry her or some shit. Then randomly, he just disappeared. Stopped opening snaps and all that. My sister thought it was weird, but BT probably just fell asleep. But it continued today. He opened them but never replied and well, now she's blocked for seemingly no reason and I messaged him an hour ago. He added to his story 3 hours ago so idk. It seems like ghosting to me but I'm not sure. Is it most likely ghosting? My sister is really upset, and if it is how can I make it easier for her? I'm really bad with this stuff. In a perfect world I'd kick his ass but well, he lives in another state."
Extreme relationship anxiety Hi I let my relationship control my feelings everyday on a serious level. Every time she opens Snapchat and doesn’t respond to me or takes a long time to respond to my texts i assume the worst. I feel like she’s gonna leave but she told me she isent. I really need advice to control these feelings someone please help I know she likes me etc but I just feel like she’s gonna go. Any tips would really help me out a lot.
"I (25m) am tired of arguing with my parents (60sf/m) about quarantine First time poster here, I'm sorry if I'm breaking any rules. Please let me know and I'll edit/delete. 

I'm apologizing in advance because this is long. 

The title is really it. I am tired of arguing with my parents (both in mid/upper 60s with health conditions) about self isolation and the shut down. I'm tired of having to argue about what is and isn't safe, I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere, and I'm hoping to get some advice on dealing with it. 

A little background: My parents and I all live together. I had plans to move out but things have been put on hold with the whole shut down deal. I'm home all the time (shop I work at is shut down), my dad has always worked from home, and my mom hasn't worked in years. This has been really hard on all of us since we don't get along that well. They were, how the kids say, abusive towards me as a child/adolescent, so our relationship is ""strained"". Both of them still say/do very hurtful things to me but I've had enough therapy to accept that's where we are right now. I was rough when I was younger and hurting because of the abuse, I try really hard now to be a good son. My mom is sick, my dad tries to take care of her, I try to take care of them both. That's the dynamic. I know it's not healthy, you don't need to tell me. I'm trying to move out because I know this is an unhealthy dynamic. 

When the shut down/quarantining deal started I went straight into planning mode. Stocked us up on food. Got hand sanitizer, soap, toilet paper, paper towels, whatever. The whole sha-bang really. I love a good plan. I moved myself into the basement (has its own bathroom and point of entry) so I could do all the shopping/errands for the family and lower the risk of infection for them. In case I need to start working again. I haven't seen my partner or my friends in months. Got a sewing machine going so I can make masks. I'm not complaining, it's what needs to be done, you know? 

Every day is an argument. Every day. My mom is mad she can't get her hair done. She's annoyed that the cat is meowing a bunch (vet said not to let her out, so I've just been taking her on walks, she gets chatty though!). My dad has similar frustrations. He wants to do his hobbies and see his friends. Both of them blame me for restricting their movements. And I get it. I am the one saying ""Do you really need to get your hair done?"", ""Can't you wait to see your friends?"" and reminding them that their actions affect everyone in the house. But if I don't do these things, we will get sick. And as bad as it sounds y'all, I am tired of fighting. I'm tired of begging my parents to consider their safety, my safety, the family's safety. I get their point of view. I want everything to go back to normal. I would love for them to be able to do all these things. But they're acting I am the gate keeper when I'm not, actually. Everything is recommended by the CDC or our local government, and I don't think it's fair that I'm getting treated like I'm the World's Biggest Jerk for reminding them of the guidelines they're supposed to follow. 

Does anyone have any advice? Anything I could possibly say to my parents to make them understand? If anyone has older parents that they care for in all this, I'd really appreciate hearing from you all. Both read the news, both are up to date on things that are happening, but they don't think it will hurt them/isn't a big deal."
My mom caught me heading a personal diffuser. The other day I(21f) was at a gas station pumping gas and hitting my personal diffuser ( the new vape pens that only have essential oils and water and vegetable glycerin) when my mom pulled up to the other side. She came around and saw it and started yelling at me. Then proceeded to call my grandmother and tell her that I was vaping and a grandmother started balling. Now my Grandpa is calling me telling me how much of a disappointment I am and how I'm going to get addicted. Quite honestly I don't know what to do.
"Should I tell her he cheated on her again? Two years or so ago, I found out my then-boyfriend was two timing me with another woman. I told the girl, furious that he had lied to both me and her, but she eventually decided to stay with him.

Fast forward to present day, I reconnected with the ex and ended up sleeping with him even though I knew he was still with that girl. I know, it's awful and I feel shit about it. I got totally caught up in my feelings after seeing him again. We were fooling around for best part of half a year. I believed he would break up with her during this time and properly reconcile with me, but he has decided not to. My question is, should I tell the girl again? And yes, I know I am being the crazy vindictive bitch in this scenario. But I just feel so scorned that he gets to get away with it again, with no consequences. I get so fucking angry at the idea that she will never know.

He still somehow thinks we can be friends and keeps telling me that he hopes we can continue to love and respect each other. How do I gather the courage to let go of him again? It really hurts to think that I may not even get the chance to be friends with him.

Advice please? Is it wrong for me to tell her considering I was the willing participant in this?"
"How do I move on from my slightly toxic relationship with someone I was really in love with? and should I feel shitty for talking to someone else 2 months after the relationship ends? My (20,f) ex boyfriend (21,m) of 3 years and I recently broke up. To start I will say that I really did love him so much, I was willing to sacrifice so much to make our relationship work, and I did. For the first while we had a lot of fun together and the love felt really genuine. We both loved partying and being with our friends and we also enjoyed spending time together. Over the years we had some really bad fights, like screaming profanities and crying in the middle of the road type of fights. Every time one of these fights happened it just tore me down little by little. 

I had made mistakes, nothing like cheating, but i had done some things that I wouldn’t have liked to be done to me. I just felt like even when we talked things out and I thought they were done, if we got into a fight he’d immediately go back to the few things I’d done to hurt him and it would always end in me crying and screaming not even knowing how to form sentences, and him calling me really bad names that took me a long time to recover from. We broke up and got back together a few times, and every time we got back together he was less affectionate. I still really loved him and he told me he did to, and I told him I wanted to grow up with him and make this work, and I always told him if we broke up it would be his choice to do so, not mine. So we stayed together and had some more really bad fights. There were some beautiful, full of live moments as well, don’t get me wrong. He was not a bad person, and he’d never hit me or anything like that. 

Fast forward a little bit. September 2019 I started college as a full time student with the goal of, in a few years, becoming a teacher. He told me all the time that he was going to go to school soon, he was gonna get a good job soon, it was always “gonna” and “soon”. I encouraged him in a nothing but loving way to try and enroll in school, and I knew his mother had some money for him to do so. And he just didn’t get to it. I was working as a housekeeper and in college full time, the nights I could still go out with him and our friends I had to be home early, and I also simply stopped liking being out with all my drunk “friends”. 

At this point the only times he would say affectionate things or try and have sex with me was when he was drunk, and even then he was usually too drunk to actually have sex. It was to a point where I was looking forward to when he was wasted because then he could actually be sweet to me. Now I do believe he did love me. And I do believe he had some metal and trust issues that prevented him from fully expressing his love to me. (Maybe I’m naive for thinking he really did love me, but truly I believed him) but 2 20 year olds should be having sex more than like once every six months (correct me if I’m wrong, this is obviously the only relationship I’ve had in adulthood) 

It started to really affect me and make me feel unwanted and like I wasn’t attractive. I could have even lived without sex really. It started to feel like kisses were forced on his end and like I only got cuddles if it was a rare occasion and if I did I never really felt like he was into it. When I asked about these things he’d say “no it’s not you” and “of course I don’t have to force myself to kiss you” or just simply “i don’t know” (one of his favourites). 

It’s been 3 years now and I’m starting to really try and look at our relationship from a different perspective than mine. I had really high hopes for him because he was really a deep thinker and he was smart, but at this point in our lives it was obvious that we were on different paths. He was still trying to party every chance he could, I was only working two days a week and he wasn’t working (other than the occasional drug sale but I mean, come on.) so we never had money for dates, which wasn’t super important to me but it would have been nice to go out and get dinner one night instead of going and getting absolutely wasted in a park or someone’s garage. 

I was tired of the lifestyle. I had met very smart, interesting and sweet friends in college who I was spending a lot of time with and connecting with. I was getting high marks in school after graduating from high school from an alternative school with barely passing grades. I was much more sober than I’d been in a very long time. I was going to the gym regularly. Ultimately, I had a completely different life than him. He was still partying, still dealing with drugs, still getting into  random street fights, still dealing with court. I loved him so much so it was so hard to watch him go through all of this knowing if he just got his shit together he could be so brilliant. 

Eventually there was a complete lack of affection or effort to better himself. And we got into a big fight, I wasn’t going to break up with him because, well at this point I was just scared of life without him, but then he said “oh ya just go blab to your friends about how much of a piece of shit I am” which triggered me because I literally do not tell anyone what house on with me and him anymore because I know it makes him furious. So I really just lost it, all I could think was how he doesn’t trust me. But also how he’s still saying these manipulative things. 

So I broke up with him. It’s been about 2 months now. We’ve seen each other a few times and there was one drunk night where I regretfully let him sweet talk me. But ultimately I know I can’t go back to that feeling right now. 

There’s also been someone else in the last two weeks that I’ve been talking to online who lives in the town over from me. It is nice to not have pressure of having to actually meet him right because of Covid, and it’s just nice to have someone after three years tell me I’m cute. 

Today, my ex messaged me and my was clearly very distressed. I got told things like “I wanted to marry you I still love you” and “have fun with your new fuck buddy i might as well did everyone leaves” in the same sentence. He also forced me to tell him who I was talking to, and after I finally told him he immediately said nasty things about the other guy. I felt so bad and hurt because I always told him I wouldn’t leave him. But I also told him every single day that I needed him to show me more affection and try and stop drinking SO much, and I never really saw any change. 

If you’re still reading; thank you. I guess the advice I want to ask is how do I deal with this feeling of guilt when I know it’s just not right for us to be together anymore? And am I a bad person for talking to someone else already? I really did love him so much, the love was eventually just not enough to handle the fighting with no affection afterwards. How do I move past this knowing I’ve hurt someone I care about deeply, but simply can’t love anymore? For so long I’ve only had his words in my mind, I just want to know what other people think about this, or how you dealt with it if you were in a similar situation. I almost felt like I wasn’t allowed to break up with him."
"Gay Relationship advice? Hello r/relationship_advice

Using a throwaway for this. I've posted this in other subreddits, I'm just trying to get as many opinions as possible.

I've (23m) been seeing a guy (24m) since late January, almost 4 months now. He has not said this, but I think I may be his first relationship ever, let alone his first gay relationship. Things have mostly been very good for us during this time, but something happened recently that really bothered me and has been on my mind ever since. 

A couple of weeks ago, I asked him if we are in a relationship. I thought this was a no-brainer, and I kind of just wanted to hear him say the words. Thing is, his response was not at all what I expected. He told me no, we are not. And that one day he will meet a woman, and when that happens he will end things with me so he can start a family... but we can still be friends.. This obviously fucked with my head, with him essentially telling me that he had future plans to cheat on me. 

We spent the next week discussing this off and on. Eventually, he was willing to admit that we are, in fact, in a relationship. But he would not yield on the leaving me for a woman part. Prior to this, I was very close to saying I love you to him. And I still feel it. But now I feel like I am in love with someone who cannot, and will never, love me. 

I am getting a lot of mixed signals from him in this regard. We talk every day, multiple times a day. We see eachother 3-5 times a week, sometimes even for just 30 minutes or so. Sometimes it seems like he is stopping over just to check on me.. He has helped me furnish my apartment, and carry it up 4 long flights of stairs to my apartment. He has told me that he CARES about me, and wants to be friends even after things between us end. 

What I want and deserve is to be loved. And what is best for me is to be happy. Right now, he makes me happy. I've expressed all of this to him. But I don't know how to go forward from here. What should I do? Should I just walk away from this now and protect myself? Should I just try to enjoy the time we have together now? I think that the longer this goes on, the more it will hurt me in the end. Any advice you could offer me would be great. Thanks."
"My(29M) gf(30F) has drinking problem We have been together for almost a year in a long distance relationship. She has drinking problem, every night gets drunk and spread negativity so hard for no reason. Sometimes she says bad words to me and to my family too. When I say you are drunk please stop, she denies that she is drunk! And the next day she cries for forgiveness. She claims something bad happened in her past and she is drinking to forget it. Never tells me what tho. I started to think it is just an excuse to drink. Ofc doesn't accept that she is an alcoholic. No idea how to make her stop.
Yesterday night was fucked up, she said really bad things about my family and friends, and I said I'm done. Now she has been crying as hard as she can for forgiveness. I feel really bad no idea what to do."
"M31 poly (26F and 19F) need some advice on pregnancy dilemma please Hey all, I could really use your advice. So long story short after some accidents both of my partners have ended up pregnant. We were all sloppy so it’s not really anyone’s fault per say, and we’ve agreed to be a lot more careful moving forward and figure this situation out. This is obviously difficult for everyone, but I have some mixed feelings and I don’t know what to do.

To be blunt and please don’t judge me, I really want my older partner to have an abortion, but keep the baby of the younger. I have a closer emotional  connection with her having been with her for a year and a half and I think the younger the better for the child to have the best chance, and she’s been hinting to me that she would want to have children together some day. My older partner has BPD and we’ve had some struggles so I don’t think I’m ready for that nor would it be fair to the baby. 

How should I bring this up with them and navigate that conversation? Should I address it at the same time or talk to each of them individually? This is a challenge in communication I’m really not ready for. I really don’t know where to start. 

Thank you for any help."
"I [24M] am in love with my best friend [23F] of 3 years that I used to sleep with, who is now happily in a serious relationship. Messy situation. We were friends with benefits off and on for over two years, and we kept taking turns getting feelings for the other person but never at the same time. I also felt like it would be a bad idea to get involved romantically because I cherish what I have with her so much, and I was worried if things screw up we wouldn't be able to go back to being just friends (I realize this doesn't make a ton of sense in hindsight). 

She's now been in a serious relationship with someone (literally lives with him right now), and has been for a few months. We were just hanging out and he called her, and I could hear how attracted she was to him through her voice. That seriously felt like a kick in the stomach. 

Every time this guy comes up into conversation it feels like repeat punches. The way things are right now is very hard on me emotionally, but I realize I put myself in this position and don't have any right to complain. 

I feel like I need to distance myself for a bit but that's not fair to her at all.  


What should I do?"

"(M20)I have a girlfriend(f19), but recently I have been developing feelings for my good (m20)friends (f19)girlfriend. This is complicated. So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 2 years now. I love her very much, but sometimes I am left wondering if me and her have a future. I love her and want to see if I can make things work, but then something unexpected happened. I have a good friend and I’ve always had a solid relationship with his girlfriend of 3 years. I consider those two to be two of my closest friends, we’ve been friends for 4+ years. They’ve both been with me through thick and thin, I respect them equally. Now here’s where things get complicated. I was in a pretty bad spot in my relationship, things weren’t looking good and it was getting to the point where I was considering ending things. I talked my feelings through with my friends girlfriend, only to find out she has been feeling these same feelings for her boyfriend. We both had very similar problems, our significant others were just not mature enough and it was causing us to loose feelings for them significantly. She told me that at this point she sees him as “just a good friend” but is too nervous to pull the plug on the relationship (he has a bad history with depression). 
As time went on, I realized my relationship has a lot to offer and I haven’t been putting enough effort maybe as I should’ve been, so I tried to start fresh and a new with her. During this time, my friend GF continued to loose interest in my friend to the pint where they barely see each other now. My relationship with my gf has turned rocky again, but not as bad as before. During this time period, me and my friends GF have been talking every day on Snapchat. We have become closer, gotten in touch with what’s going on in each other’s lives, and I’m worried that now I’m starting to become attracted to her physically and mentally. She is more mature, interesting, and I’ve become more attracted to her face then my own girlfriends. We soon became best friends on Snapchat and though we have never outright told each other we like each other and we’re not flirting out of respect for each other’s spouses, we definitely seem to have a connection. We say we miss hanging out all the time and she says the first place she’s going once this quarantine is over is my place to hang. Nothing crazy flirty has been happening I’ll say once again, but I’m nervous and I just don’t know what to do. We’re all 20 and I am scared of commitment because I feel like I have so much more to experience. I respect my friend and I wouldn’t want to ruin his relationship, even though he already has himself due to his own childish attitudes. He’s been spoon fed  his whole life (much like my own gf) and, while this is none of my business, the two of them have never had sex in their entire 3 year relationship due to his anxiety. I don’t know what to do in this point in time, I’m always anxious and nervous and I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings."
"I(f18) Found photos on his(m21) phone We’ve been together for a year on the 19th and I love him so much but the other day I was on his phone and I found LOADS of photos of a bunch of girls a couple were our friends!!! I’m heartbroken. He never ever gave any sign of doing this type of thing, no red flags or anything. When I confronted him all he said was he’s sorry and didn’t see it different from porn. I’m so confused because he always brings me flowers and have sex often. When I told him to look at pictures of me he said he needed something new. Please help!

"Should I disinvite one of my Groomsmen Groomsmen friend of mine and I were close friends growing up, and I asked him to be in my wedding about 8 months ago.

From ideological to differences in respect and friendship, I don’t think he respects me or my fiancé in nearly the same manner that I had thought he would given our friendship. He has made several comments that make my fiancé uncomfortable about how he feels about our beliefs and has generally gotten rid of most of the other friends we shared when we were younger. I wish I had a better explanation as to why he’s cut most of us off, but I think I’m the only one left who he talks to. Anyway, I’m kind of unsure what to do with this situation and I don’t know how to handle disinviting someone from a bridal party or how (if possible) to repair our friendship. Appreciate any advice!"
"My boyfriend (M22) of 4 years broke up with me(F25) because I am fat... but I am not. What would you do? Help! I need you real, mature advise please!

We met when I was 21, he was 18. I naver date younger man, but I really liked him. He is a great person. We clicked instantly and started dating. I was his first girlfriend, he was my second boyfriend. The first year of the relationship was heavenly. He, indeed is an amazing person and during the relationship I felt really blessed and lucky to have him. He helped me with ANYTHING I ever needed, he is very funny and just a great, bubbly person to be around. Definitely a great friend to have. He loved me too and it was very noticeable to everyone around. His family also really liked me and my family loved him as well. 

Now, when I met him, I was a little on the heavier side - 5'3 and 170lbs. However, he made me feel loved and beautiful and I never had any issues with my body image. A year into our relationship, he started hinting that I should lose some weight. I actually wanted to do it for a long time because I had symptoms of a fatty liver due to the extra weight, so... I did it. I lost a lot of weight within 5-6 months, and I reached 110 lbs. I did not do it the healthy way, I was restricting my food a lot and was on the verge of anorexia. I even fainted a couple of times. He would complement me for my weightloss, but.. I could feel something has changed... he was becoming more distant, but I think it was due to him not being fulfilled professionally. Then, one year later I started gradually gaining the weight back. I was still very active (gym 6 times a week, healthy food 80% of the time) but due to the very restrictive diet I followed previously, my metabolism was pretty much inactive. He noticed it and last summer he told me I need to lose weight. At that point, I was around 140lbs, however, because I go to the gym, I feel like I carried it pretty well. Also, last summer, he wanted to move abroad to the USA (it was actually my idea but he liked it). We talked about it and decided we'll go together, that we will marry. I supported him through the entire process, and wen he received the visa, we celebrated. 2 days later, he tells me that he wants to go alone and that he is very scared of getting married and doesnt want a serious relationship with me anymore. I was devastated, I didnt want to believe it, I felt so betrayed. While I was obviously very sad and crying, he also said that he wants to gain experience with other girls as well. Somehow, I insisted and as he left for the USA, we stayed together - long distance. I applied for a visa, willing to sacrifice everything I had back home just to go to him and be together. I applied for the visa, I got it and the next thing I know, he came back from the USA, after not even a month staying there. He appeared at my door acting like he was GOD coming back from haven. I was happy to see him, but I felt like he was very selfish. I had a visa, I almost said goodbye to everyone, and here he is.. back home for good, without even talking about it with me? Dont my plans matter too?   

Now, since summer, until last month I gained a little more here and there, however, still going to the gym, working hard and eating healthy. However, he has completely lost interest in me. He tried breaking up a few times but didnt say it directly so I didnt really take the hint (or maybe didnt want to admit it). He didnt want to have sex with me, would even have a hard time having an erection. I didnt let myself get affected by this but it is very hard, and if I was emotionally weaker, I know that this would be pretty serious for my body image. Every time we would see each other for the past months he was just straight mean to me, always grabbing my stomach and asking me when it will go away. He also started saying that I am lazy?! Wtf?! I tried talking to him and tellying him that it bothers me countless times but he never seemed to listen. I also feel like the relationship has been very selfish from his side during the past months (in the very few times we had sex too). I also caught him checking out girls in public a lot. Moreover, he was logged into my computer, and I accidentaly found out he has been searching for prostitutes online. When I confronted him about it, he said it was just a joke (how stupid does he think I am). Now last month, because I could not take it anymore, always being disrespected and literally crying everytime I would see him because he made me feel bad about myself, I told him that this could no longer go on this way and wanted to have a final talk about it. Instead, his answer was ""I am tired, we'll talk some other time"" and left. We haven't spoken ever since. I saw he made an instagram account and has been watching my stories.. Here is what I struggle with:

1. During the past 4 years of our relationship, I have been the only person who was by his side. All of his friends turned out to be fake (it happens a lot at young ages) however, I was his ride or die. I forgave him for many things because I believe that when something breaks, you should at least try to repair it, not throw it away. So given this context, how can you break up with someone who committed to you for 4 years, because of a few extra pounds? Shouldn't you at least try to work it out? Especially because I am not lazy or unhealthy.. I am very healthy and active (actually more than him). I don't blame anyone for not wanting to be with someone if their lifestyles don't fit, but this is not our case.  
2. During one of our previous conversations, I asked him why he was such a jerk to me lately and if he is not attracted to me anymore just because I gained weight. He said ""When I first met you, even though you were fatter than now, I didnt see it because it was my first relationship and I was inlove. I started noticing it a year into it and than you lost weight and you looked great. Now, I you started gaining again."" I appreciate the honesty but it just breaks my heart. 
3. I think that there might be other issues as well. Actually I am sure about it. He is very unhappy with his life at the moment (professionally) and is kinda jealous of me. He said it once and I could feel it as well. Last November, I have won a scholarship for one month in China, and when I came back, he didnt ask me anything about the trip, he didnt even want to see any pictures. So I think that it has more to do with him than with my appearance really. 
4. My parents dont know that we broke up, but they are VERY old school. I am stressed ot avery day because they always pressure me to get married and have kids as soon as possible (sometimes I feel like they don't even care who the father would be). 

But finally, what do I do? Should I give up on the relationship? I feel like I have stayed in the relationship for the past 2 years with the hope he will become the person he used to be. I really love him, and aside oth these issues, he is everything I wanted in a man. 

How do I boost my confidence? This has taken a toll on me and now I catch myself thinking I will never find anyone better, funnier, friendlier, more trustworthy and samart. I dont want to let this affect me too much, since I am a person with ambitions and goals in life and refuse to let someone's poor thinking influence me negatively.. but it is very tricky at this point, will not lie. Btw, since we broke up, I lost 10lbs. 

I dont think the problem is really in my appearance ( I am actually an attractive woman, long blond hair, green eyes, curvy, have been financially independent since 17, working at really good jobs, have visited more than 38 countries for free and I am close to having my own talk show in my country.) He is an ambitious young man who will be very successful one day. 

DISCLAIMER: Being fat (no, I am not afraid of using this word) doesn't mean yu are less wothy of love or you should allow other to treat you poorly. I only stated my numbers in this story for context.

P.S: Writing all of it down has actually put a lot of things into perspective to me. I realized that he told me (indirectly) that he doesnt like me anymore for some time now, I just didnt want to see it. It is my fault, I understand, but do I have the right to be mad at him?

"I (27m) sexually assaulted my gf. Before I tell my story I just want to say. Bear with me. I know I am the bad guy here. I know my failings and it causes me great shame. This is a low point of my life and I want to make it better. But I need advice and I dont know who I can turn to. 

I met this girl three or four months prior to the incident and we hit it off immediately. We had a connection. I felt close to her. I remember being constantly surprised how long we had been dating for because it felt so much longer. It was a good relationship. Not without it’s kinks but that’s normal and I really wanted to make it work so I tried to be open to my failures and to be receptive to her needs. Good. At the time of the incident we were at a lower point. I had been really stressed and agitated about work and life and I wasn’t communicating. I was being rude and unappreciative. She came over that night for dinner and it wasn’t ok. I was being snappy but she was putting up with it. The night went on and we are laying in bed and start to fool around. 

I want to say. This part is difficult to talk about for a couple reasons. One, I don’t want to be so specific as to be explicit. And two, Sexual assault accounts can be sensitive to those who have survived them and I don’t want to cause any grief. So with that in mind I’ll be brief so as to get the general point across. 

We had sex. Normal. Consensual. I brought up anal and she said no. We go back to normal but later I brought it up again. No. I asked if we could try anyway and she silently nodded. So I try. I didn’t go very far before it became very apparent that something was wrong. We stopped immediately and she was visibly disturbed and unable to talk. Shaken. And I felt as though she was slowly realizing what had happened. She left for the night. Typing this out it’s easy for me to see how wrong I was. But at the time it was like I couldn’t hear her. I wasn’t listening to what she was saying and I was only thinking about my wants. I was being selfish. And I pressured her into doing something she did not want to do. We broke up about a month later. At the time we thought it was for something unrelated to the incident. But looking back now I don’t see how it couldn’t be a part of it. And now I’m racked with the feeling of guilt and shame. I’m ashamed for what I did. And I want to know what I could possibly do to make up for it. But I am also worried. I am worried that I am just trying to solve for my feelings over the hers again. How do I know that what I say. The apologies I make. aren’t just to appease a guilty conscience. What could I possibly say to take away the pain I caused her? To give her back a feeling of safety. 

I wish deeply that this had never happened but it did. And it’s my fault. And now I just want to do the right thing."
"I [17M] just had a deep conversation with a girl [17F] I'm trying to be really good friends with about something I didn't like about her, and now I don't know how to feel I've known this girl for nearly a year and a half, but recently due to quarantine, I started wanting to become good friends, with hopes of being best friends. We both have trust issues when it comes to friends because of things that have happened in the past. I began trusting her and telling her about myself in a way that I haven't done in nearly 7 years, and began to trust me as well. However, the one thing I find annoying about her is how inconsistent she is at texting. She has super strict rules about when and where she can text, so I don't mind that during the day as much. I, however, always respond super fast, within 5 minutes. I personally have dealt with a lot of pain from friends and just emotionally, and I knew she was a person I could trust and finally tell someone. We usually call on weekdays to study and chill or do whatever, but at night-time, I sometimes will tell her personal stories about myself. The other night, however, I began to feel doubtful about whether or not I was getting the same amount of effort I put into this friendship.

Pretty much what happened was that we began texting, and I told her stories about my life, and when I was done... silence. Not a text back, no reaction, no nothing. The night after this one, I addressed my concerns to her about her texting, and how if I tell a story, I expect a certain amount of attention and a timely response. She apologized and said that she would try harder, so I was content and returned to normal. The night RIGHT AFTER THIS ONE, I finished telling my story, and again, silence. I waited 10 minutes and just said I was going to bed and goodnight. A few minutes after she texts back saying that she had to get something, and that's why she couldn't text back. I was still annoyed though because I had told her that if you have to go somewhere, tell me ""brb"" or ""gtg"" so that I'm not sitting and waiting for a response only to be met with disappointment. I tried to put off my sour mood and continued texting, and after she told me some things, she said, ""how about you?"" So I answered with a personal bit about myself aaaaaaaand... silence. I again just said goodnight and for real, I went to bed, I woke the next morning to texts saying that she had fallen asleep and couldn't even remember asking me about my opinion. I couldn't put off my feelings this time, so today I talked to her about it. I wasn't planning on saying it, but I felt like if we were to become best friends, I shouldn't hide how I feel from her and if she was mad at me, I would want her to tell me as well. So we talked and talked, and I got out how I felt about everything. I told her that she reminded me of people in the past that I thought were my friends, but they ended up hurting me. Some of the actions that she has done have made me compare them to her and went that happens, I begin to lock up emotionally and push people away. After all this, she seemed so sad and I felt so, so horrible, in a way I have never felt before. She said that she needed time to think about everything and she would come back to me with a response to the whole situation.

I really enjoy being around this person. It makes me so happy to talk to her every day, and become her friend has been one of the best decisions I have made this year for sure. We always make each other laugh and make those jokes that poke at each other, and I feel like what we have is genuine. Now my biggest fear is losing this friendship, I'm afraid now that since I told her this, she will feel differently now about becoming close and that I should have just kept my mouth shut. My personal experiences have made me not have a very close friend for nearly 7 years, and I think I am so afraid of getting hurt again that I began to look for small things and overthink to try and push her away to prevent feeling anything like that again. Now, however, I feel so hurt because I made her feel like she is the problem when in reality it is just me. I couldn't bring myself to tell her everything about my past and why I feel this way, but now I wish that I had. She is a positive and caring person with no enemies and is truly a one-of-a-kind person to me. I've never met anyone like her and if I lost this friendship, it would really break me into pieces. Please tell me any advice/thoughts about my situation and how you think I should approach this from here on out. 

TLDR: Deep conversation about something I dislike about a close friend. I could tell she felt bad and is now thinking about a response to this whole situation. Advice on how I should approach this/what I should have done is appreciated.

Additional notes: 

\-She is very independent, doesn't rely on her friends a lot, and rarely calls them.

\-Her family is strict about rules and technology, so I understand why things are delayed sometimes."
"My boyfriend pointed out my cellulite &amp; idk how I feel about that Yesterday my boyfriend had asked me “what those dents in my thighs were”, &amp; he pointed at my cellulite. I was a bit surprised that he asked me that because I assume most men know what cellulite is, I had told him it was my cellulite &amp; he asked me what does that mean &amp; I said that it just means that I have extra fat in my thighs basically... the conversation kind of rubbed me off the wrong way but I don’t know if he was genuinely just clueless and curious so I tried not to be offended by it. We’ve been dating for 8 months, so I had told him I’ve always had cellulite &amp; asked if he’s noticed it before &amp; he said he never noticed it. We’re both 20 years old. Was this harmless or do you guys think he was trying to tell me something?? I’ve never had anyone point out my cellulite before so I didn’t really know how to react. He had also previously told me I was gaining some weight due to quarantine, &amp; I didn’t get mad at that but rather took it into consideration to watch my weight. while my legs were shown over FaceTime he looked at them and said “oh my god what is that” &amp; when I got offended he said he was just making a joke. so I don’t know if he’s just looking at my flaws a lot more lately or something &amp; trying to get me to lose weight through pointing them out. I’m pear shaped so I carry a lot of fat in my thighs &amp; they’re bigger then the rest of my body, but my stomach isn’t round so I actually don’t think I look bad at all but he’s been making me feel more self conscious about my body.. what do you guys think of this?"
"My parents want to hold me hostage ? 
Hey, yeah the title of this post is weird but it’s also a weird situation.

I am a student, i’m 19, &amp; I live 4 hours away from my parents home. I moved out for university &amp; my parents pay the rent. 
Since the beginning of the lockdown, i have been staying in my flat, but my parents want me to go back home. 
My mother called me &amp; told me that she will come by next week &amp; take me with her.
I said no, because i am currently getting back my life on track so i am busy even if i don’t have a job/ go outside. &amp; i have a very bad relationship with them, they don’t realise how toxic/ mean they are all the time. every time i go back home, it NEVER ends well. i end up having a mental breakdown &amp; it’s not pretty. 
If you think i am ungrateful, that they are my parents &amp; are worried about me, i understand. but you weren’t here for the first 18 years of my life, when i was literally counting the day until i could leave. they hurt me so much, i don’t even have the words to describe this.

So what should i do? i tried to talk to them about it but, nope, problem still unsolved. when they come by next week after four hours of travel should i barricade myself in my flat? what the f*ck?"
"I like my ex’s best friend and she likes me. What should I do? So recently (about a month ago or so) I (15M) broke up with my ex (16F). It just wasn’t really working between us, so I decided to break things off. Her best friend (15F) and I have always been friendly, and we’ve been friends for about 3-4 months now. However, when I broke up with my ex, her best friend and I started talking more. I started to develop feelings for her and I told her how I felt but I wouldnt push her to do anything because I don’t want to ruin her friendship. In response to this, she told me she has liked me for about 10 months (I dated my ex for 7 months). I really do like her and we’ve flirted a bit and i’m super confused about what I should do. I definitely want to try it, and I think she feels the same as well. Should I wait for my ex to cool down a bit (she’s really sad and angry)? Any advice would really help right now."
"A good friend says she wants to be just friends, but acts as if we are more than that Ok. So we share a bit of history. I asked her out a few months ago and after trying for a few weeks she decided it wasn't the right time for that. We moved on and kept being good friends.
Right now, we met after not seeing each other for a while, and she acts very strangely: way more touchy, always talking about her exs and what she wants in a future boyfriend etc...
When we talked, she said she loves me a lot in a non romantic way, while also claiming she wants to be close to me and be with me all the time.
I am very confused by this. It feels like she's saying one thing and doing the other. I don't even know if I still like her. I just want to understand the situation.

TL:DR
A good friend claims to love me as a friend but acts as if we are more"
"Gf claims I’m not showing interest in her We had some form of argument today, she’s 20 I’m 21. She claims I lack empathy and interest. Claims we barely talk and I just don’t know what to do about this. We’ve been together almost a year now. We’re both new to the idea of being in a relationship. When I ask her to simply tell me what she expects she says things like “i don’t want a puppet it won’t be real if I tell you what you should do”. I just don’t understand how to make this better. If you guys have tips I’d appreciate it"
"I (F18) need help with asking my dad for more privacy I’m not exactly good at explaining myself, so I was hoping you guys could help. I am planning on staying with my family for the first few years of university, and I’m really grateful that they are allowing me to stay. However, there are a few things that my dad insists on that makes me uncomfortable. He sometimes checks my search history, and won’t allow me to set up my computer in my room (I’d be using it as a way to study, as it is quiet and away from everyone else). This was understandable when I was younger, because I was too curious for my own good, but I’m an adult now. I want to talk to him about it, but I’m afraid he will retaliate and check it again (I’ve looked up private medical things and I don’t want him to see that). Any help would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading"
"Resources for advice on dating a girl with a learning disability? Hi, I recently started dating a girl with a learning disability.  I don't know specifically which type.  I really care for her a lot, and I'd like to inform myself on things that I should know better vis a vis dating her or just general knowledge.  I'm not entirely sure that it is something super severe - she finished high school no problem, struggled (didn't finish) in college, and doesn't think she'll be ever be able to drive because the written exam is, quote, impossible.

I think I intimidate her a little bit because (I do not want to toot my own horn but I am just being objective) I guess I would consider myself as having an above average intellect.  I have a graduate science degree and two bachelor's of science.  But I don't really care about it that much (in the sense that it would be a dealbreaker or anything), she is not unintelligent by any stretch of the imagination and I just genuinely love being around her and she just makes me feel real damn happy.  But it is a source of discomfort/anxiety for her that I would like to assuage a little bit if I can.  Hopefully this makes sense and doesn't make me sound like some asshole putting himself on a pedestal.  Books would be great, but I'll take anything.  It's probably tricky without knowing what specific type of learning disability it is, but a point in the right direction should do the trick."
"Feeling sad about my (F20s) friends and siblings (20s) getting into relationships and moving on and away from me... I seem to be at the age where my friends and my siblings are getting into relationships (even getting married!) and I’m finding it really lonely.

I’ve never really felt a romantic connection with anybody and am half considering that I may be asexual so it’s hard for me to relate to them when they want to spend 90% of their time with their SO...

I know this sounds infantile and immature and I should just respect their life choices and partners but I can’t help feeling lonely, like I’m now second best in their life because they have this amazing new romantic partner.

Can anyone help me understand, or offer some advice or a kind word? Thank you :)"
"(23M) Fake it till I make it or just be myself? I’ve had a lot of good advice from this sub, and it’s really helped me. However when it comes to women (I have a date coming up in a few months, she’s currently out of country but I asked her and she said yes) I’ve seen a bit of a differentials of opinions.

I’m generally a low self esteem person thanks to mental health issues which I am going to be getting help for. 

One side says fake it till I make it, fake confidence and attract people that way.

The other says just be myself, which I try to do most the time but struggle to be around the majority of people. (A weird, quirky but funny guy whose always messing around and making jokes/dark humour that shouldn’t be joked about but entertain people, but I am caring and kind)

Which one overall would you say is the better approach? 

Generally just bring myself puts a lot of people off because I’m a little “odd” or “different” to 99% of men and I’m a little bit more feminine with my interests and find myself helping out my female friends with their girly stuff a lot. The friends and girls around me who I do hang out with and stuff literally adore me, but only like me as a friend, can’t blame them I’m not that attractive which seems to be main reason of rejection (I’m more “cute” than sexy/hot if that makes sense).

Thanks everyone"
"(20f) My Best (Now) Ex-Best (21f) friend’s fiancé (24m) now husband sexually harassed me twice This is going to be along one so I do appreciate those who will take time to look at this post. 
So to start off me and this girl, I’ll call her Julie. Me and Julie have been friends for over 10 years and we have had our ups and downs but we were always there for each other. So her and her now husband, who I’ll call Joe. At the time they had first gotten together they may have been together almost a year when they stopped by my house and we were just hanging out everything was fine. Until he started pinching my butt and touching my sides when she wasn’t paying attention. I tried to just ignore it at first then we were sitting on the couch and I first got this bad vibe when she started kissing him in front of me and messing with him. After all that stopped we put on a movie and we were watching and then he reached over and ran his hang across my leg and then touched me “there”. I was 16 at the time, and he was 21. Our friendship became very shaky after that. We didn’t talk for a while but slowly we began to talk and become friends again. So they get engaged, I was the maid of honor.  I ended up going to stay at their house for about a week.  Me and her thought it would be great to have some girl time and hang out. I didn’t think anything of it because her fiancé would be gone all day and she normally got home before him. So I didn’t worry about being alone with him. Then something happened and he ended up getting off work early and she wouldn’t be home for an hour or so. I was sitting on the couch just watching tv and then he comes and sits at the other end. He started trying to feel up on me and then asked if I would blow him. I told him no. Then he asked if I would tell him if he dick was average size, and walks back into the room with it out. About that time I was about to flip. He starts getting closer to me and I tell him to stop and that he’s making me uncomfortable. Then telling me she doesn’t have to know about it. It ends there and she gets home. We go to the store together and I tell her what happened. We go back to her house she goes inside and I can hear the yelling from the car. She comes back out and we go to the store then come back. This is when things get really bad. Yelling and screaming. Him telling me that I need to apologize to him that it’s my fault. Then she threatened to leave and so he ends up leaving and then his mom shows up and tried saying that it was all my fault and that I must have been drunk and came on to him. Then she had the audacity to tell me when my friend was out of ear shot “ you know I had a best friend and her husband made a move on me before the wedding but I didn’t tell her I just let them get married and forgot about it.” I was in tears by then because I felt like complete utter crap. Julie’s mom came to get us and we left. But that’s didn’t last long he came and talked her back into getting back together. We stopped talking and when I spoke to one of her cousins who was one of my close friends that had something similar happen to her. Her cousins stopped talking to her like she use to. Then Julie started to cuss me and tell me it was no ones business and that I need to keep my mouth shut.  And that was that. This happened almost a year ago and I’m still hurt about it. I was there for her through everything but she still chose him over everything. And that was that."
"MY BF's(19), YOUNGER BROTHER (17), IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO ME (20) AND SEEMS LIKE HE HAS OUT OUT FOR ME DESPITE PROPERLY GETTING TO KNOW ME Hi, so ive been dating my BF for almost a month now. i've been to his house a couple times and have met his family, including his brother before. I never really got the chance to actually have a conversation with his brother one on one or even with my BF bc hes always in his room. its really clear that were serious about each other as we both started dating pretty fast but we know what we want and my BF and i are on the same page completely. Recently on a face time call my Bf muted his mic to talk to his brother and the conversation lasted a whileeee. I decided to hang up to let them talk but right after i hung up my bf immediately called me back freaking out asking why i hung up on him saying that i was being rude. After that his brother started commenting about me hanging up and saying things like what i did was toxic and"" you guys shouldn't be fighting over something like that early on in the relationship"" even though it was clearly behind up and it was a miscommunication. His brother then proceeds to compare me to his 16 yr old ex girlfriend and says that i'm going to do the same things she did to him to to my BF. I was completely in shock at the allegations and defended myself  saying that he does not know me and cant compare me to someone that is still in high school. My Bf was defending me but i was clearly upset bc ive never had someone be so blatantly disrespectful to me before especially someone i don't know like that. He was saying this like stay away from my family and telling his brother to break up with me.  He proceeded to call me a bitch as i was arguing with him and brought why my bf doesn't do drugs around me bc he says hes being fake and not showing me the real him when really my bf just doesn't want me to see him like that so early on 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been in this situation before so i'm still currently crying my eyes out trying to decide if its worth it if his brother thinks of me in such a negative way already without getting to know me. In my eyes your family is a reflection of who you are in some ways so i don't really feel comfortable being around his brother anymore knowing how he feels about me personally.  I just dont know how to handle this"
"How to overcome the feeling of never being (good) enough? Okay, this one might be a bit longer. 
Last year I (33) came out as trans/ FTM, which led to my long term partner breaking up with me. Emotionally I took it quite well, since I knew how he'd react. He always stated how he thinks about trans folks and I knew the relationship wouldn't survive. Since then I dated a little, most notably 3 other FTMs (all in their early thirties). The first one was emotionally abusive and made me feel bad about myself. The second one was once close to the first one and kinda helped me heal from the trauma he caused me. But ultimately he ended the contact because we had a disagreement concerning a video game. I was shattered since I really felt a connection between us. We were so similar to each other, that it was almost scary. And him throwing all that out of the window just for a video game left me devasted. The third one was very nice and flirty from the beginning. I felt safe with him and thought, that he was really into me. We spent 3 days together after texting and video chatting for a month, including cuddling, kissing and more. Basically all the things couples do. We even were planning upcoming dates and meeting each others friends. Those 3 days were special to me. But just under an hour after he left for his drive home I got a message from him, telling me he didn't feel the spark and so on.
And now I just don't know what to do. I don't want to meet new people, I'm sick of telling people the story of my life, because I already assume that it will end in another disaster anyway. I hate it that I was never good enough and that each of them just threw me away. And I don't feel that I'll ever be enough, that I'm loveable. So Reddit, how do I overcome those intrusive thoughts and how do I become a better, loveable person?"
"my(13f) grandma(66f) is a perv HI, just so you know I'm new to reddit and need advice. So my grandma is being very weird. ( I'm 13 and a 1/2 ) my grandma is being very inappropriate and judging I don't wanna stop her. because she is just showing love and looking out for me, to begin with, she always judges my body. ""you need to have a waist of 20' in order for someone to marry you"" ""why is your butt so big?"" ""your breasts are supposed to be tiny"" ""why is your underwear stained?"" etc. one day she made me take a bath in front of her since ""I don't wash my self"" etc. and I don't know what to do. pls help."
Moving too fast? I met by current bf (24m) in July 2019 shortly after I (22f) graduated with my bachelor's degree. I was living with people who don't know how to be adults and almost got me evicted. I was already basically living with him so I officially moved in December 2019. He bought an engagement ring in January after meeting my family but hasn't proposed. Is it too soon to get married? He's in the navy so he wants to be married by April 2021 so I can move with him in 2022. We've only had one fight and he help me through my entire family being evacuated due to fires. He is the only person I want to talk through things with. I'm just worried since all of my siblings have been divorced and my parents are their second marriage. I know I want to be with him but is it too soon?
"Found out my bf (31/m) and I (29/f) both cheated on each other and after a month of dating we don’t know where to go from here.. he doesn’t want an open relationship My bf and I have been together for about 2 months. It’s been up and down for sure. I have a bad habit of breaking up with him when I’m about upset and I’ve done it a few times.

The sex is great and we see each other everyday. Our last fight was major. I felt like I’ve been dealing with a lot in our relationship and wasn’t able to heal and properly get passed the first problem when the second one started. 

He wants to have kids a few weeks into the relationship, I met his family, his racist brother in law was antagonizing. It was a lot.

I’m going to be super honest here. During the course of my relationship I did speak to a lot of random guys on Facebook messenger. He saw that and was bothered and I deleted it.

After our latest major blow up I broke up with him and we got back together a few days later. That weekend I met up with a new guy and was speaking to him.

Monday we agreed to be together but I was still talking to the new guy and apparently he’s been on all the dating apps. He didn’t bother telling me that as I didn’t bother telling him I was talking to someone.

He claims he did what he die because I’m so up and down he didn’t know if I would break up with him this week. That he was simply talking to them like I’ve been talking to my Facebook men he was waiting
For consistency then would delete the apps.

I found out today when I looked at his found. There were innocent conversations but he hid it. I still haven’t told him I was talking to someone else and had a FWB lined up. 

I’m still confused as to why we’re having sex without a condom if this is how it is..

I’m not sure what to say. I would like an open relationship and he would not. I told him let’s go back to dating and he’s not with it. 

Tl;dr Boyfriend and I both cheated on each other. I’m not sure if things are salvageable"
"Opinions on whether I’m too sensitive over what my bf says to me F24 
My bf and I have had a few arguments recently. I’ve been working closely with  my new. therapist on a past trauma of an abusive relationship. I haven’t explored it at all before with a therapist in any depth and that’s now happening and it’s surfaced a lot of things that I haven’t felt in years 

Anyway my bf made a pass off comment the other day about the way I clipped my hair up and he said I looked like some random person on the internet and I got annoyed. Then today he was talking about a PS4 game and one of his friends’ gf gets really involved. But I’m just not like that, and he said “why can’t you 4
be like that too ” And I just put the phone down because it just made me feel belittled and as I mentioned my headspace is like how it was a few years ago so I took it pretty badly and just ignored him since 

Am I in the wrong ?"
"Advice on a wedding theme: Christmas in July for me [21 F] and my fiancé [21 M] This may not belong here, but I really need opinions.

My fiancé [21 M] and I [21 F] were engaged in November 2018. I’ve always wanted a red-themed wedding, so we set our date for October 19, 2019 so I could have fall vibes (red, orange, yellow). Well, our house renovation took much longer than expected and we had to move the date, so we set it for April 25, 2020. COVID-19 showed up and we had to cancel and postpone again.

Our new date is July 25, 2020, so how about a Christmas in July theme? Rustic woods, red and green plaid, frozen hot cocoa bar. Would this be tacky? I just want a cute, light-heated theme to cheer everyone up after such a hard few months. 

We are getting married in our home state, Alabama (and no, we are not related 😂), in a little white country church. Our ceremony and reception with have less than 100 people.

Please give me your opinions!! My brain is so fried over all this wedding bs, I’ve already planned 2 whole weddings and I feel like I’m going crazy as this is our 3rd date. For the record, I really like the idea, but I don’t want to do something stupid. Our family and friends know us as the goofy couple, so this wouldn’t seem too far-fetched for us. Thank you ❤️"
"I(25M) saw a text on my girlfriend's(24F) phone that she misses her ex. I was chilling with my new girlfriend on the couch and she was showing me a bunch of old pictures. We have been dating for about 2 months. However, when she was flashing her phone to me I saw that she sent one of her friends a text that said she misses her ex. 
I was obviously kind of hurt, especially since she was RIGHT NEXT TO ME on the couch and sent that. 
I confronted her about it, and she said she was extremely sorry and that I wasn't supposed to see that. 

Basically, she was just asking her friend for reassurance (I suppose) that she did the right thing by breaking up with him. 

I'm not sure where to go from here."
"Dont know what 42M is saying to me 26F or what this means so looking for advice where to go from here or what this means lol I opened up about my ptsd to him to explain why I can be a flake sometimes. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?? HE DOESNT LIKE ME????? Is this his way of saying he wants to be just friends????? 

HIM: ""I just want you to know that I have no motivation towards you other than something that is equally health for the both of us.""  

ME: ""okay""

HIM: ""Youre beautiful, Ive enjoyed getting to know you- there is much more to learn about you- and there is no pressure on my end to make something happen other than continue this friendship. Thank you for being honest about yourself and what you struggle with."""
"Doubts in my relationship [F17] I'm [M18] Im in a relationship of  two months with a girl who is 17 years old, but since a week or two I started to doubt our relationship... We havent been texting eachother much and the conversation are getting moet and more boring... 

The doubt is about if she loves me and about the communications to eachother..

Im not feeling happy but I still want her to be happy... Yet I dont get any hints of her and I basically dont know what to do.

Is doubting your relationship bad? And is it possible you can go back to truely loving her without doubting the relationship?

What is a intelligent next step for me/us?

It would seriously help me out so much of you could reply :))"
"annoyed about boyfriend and female friend? My boyfriend has had a history of talking to girls behind my back when we started dating as teens however we are in our twenties now and hes seemed to have smartened up. We have a house and a dog and are engineering students, and he still has a few female friends but im aware of it and its not an issue at all. However, there is one girl he knew for years and only started to talk to her this year about engineering and then it started to be more “friendly”. at first she told him she would be his friend as long as i knew he wasnt tryna sleep with him, and he always said “dont worry shes not a threat” etc and i did not care at all. Now, a few months later, she tells him about her sex life and the guys shes hooking up with and he regularly asks her these questions, and she tells him when she cant have sex with her hookups (lets call one of them John) because shes bleeding etc. That was weird enough in itself but they snapchat everyday and he sends SNAPS and she always replies with typing in the chat, and he then responds with a snap again. It almost seems like he doesnt want his chats being saved with hers as if to hide them. He took a nap this afternoon and woke up and snapped her back and forth for like 10 minutes and she opened last his snap then she typed “leggings” this really weirded me out as im just seeing it, but knowing he was in bed in his boxers and i wasnt in the room and they were talking then she typed “leggings” it weirded me out so i asked about it and his voice went a little weary kind of like it used to when he was making something up, and he said “yeah i meant to tell you. It was a prank” like ??? for one he would have NEVER told me that lol, but anyways he claims this was the prank he seen on tiktok:

him: “wanna see my ass”
her: “what”
him: “whatd i say?”
her: “wanna see my ass”
him: “i thought youd never ask”

he then said “she didnt get the joke or something i dont know. she typed and said that” which makes no sense?? why would she reply that unless he specifically asked what shes wearing considering they were on the topic of butts (he is a weird guy and a fool so butt jokes are common but very weird with this situation) anyways i said “well thats weird” he said “i meant to tell you it was a joke she didn’t understand” like i know his voice and i can almost hear the unstableness in it when he could barely explain it to me, and im annoyed even if he did say that to her, WHY on earth would he?? in my opinion thats a slick way of asking for a pic while also seeming funny and not a straight up dick move , and the fact he was in bed made it worse and she then proceeded to say “leggings” which i cannot think any reason shs woukd say that unless he ASKED what shes wearing especially according to his story lol i walked out of the room without answering and he was like “yup go be fucking sooky now over a joke” and i didnt go back in. If that situation was reversed about a guy i know wearing his boxers or a joke about seeing his dick , my boyfriend would be FUELED and losing it. Im very annoyed about this and unsure if i should bring it up again but it’s obviously making me suspicious. (((this girl is also known all throughout our highschool years to have a nice butt)) Thoughts???"
"I (24/F) am going through an emotionally low point at the moment, and have been ignoring messages from the guy (34/M) I am seeing. Should I apologize and explain myself? He texted me a couple of times this week but I just did not respond. He texted me last night that he wants me to text him when I wake up because he didn't hear from me in a while. And this morning when I did respond to him he was being friendly and asking questions and trying to make conversation with me, and I was just not having it. He did not do anything... at all... honestly I am really into him... infatuated on the verge of falling in love with him.

But I have started therapy since quarantine which has forced me to deal with not so great things in my past. A lot of trauma... a lot of trust issues.. a lot of not so great things (multiple instances of sexual assault). I have started crying a lot... become closed off from everyone -- my friends, family, everyone. I don't really want to talk to anyone. I just want to cry all the time and not leave my bed..

I was thinking of sending him a text apologizing for how distant I have been. Not really going into the reason as to why. Just saying 'sorry, I care a lot about you, but I need space to deal with me""

I am super hesitant and I don't know if I should send him anything because of the major trust issues that I have -- if I acknowledge the issues then he might leave me...?

Yeah, I know... logic might be flawed but I am trying to fix it...

\*\* i am not going to my friends about it because I really just don't want to deal with them and asking questions and asking me where I have gone... I love them.. but that just seems like such a headache.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: should I apologize to the guy that I am seeing for being AWOL"
"Should i cut it off? So, i met a boy on tinder and we live far away like 4hours with the plane and we’ve been talking for a month. And he is super nice compliments me every time and says goodmorning everyday. But when i asked if we could call of videochat he said he hates it. So i was like okay then after a few weeks i asksd again and he said he’ll let me know when he is ready but now i’m debating whether he really is into me or just playing. Even though we talked about me being his wifey and him being skeptical about ldr. And he always says he wants to meet me and stuff and that after we meet that he’ll know if we should date or not. And he also replies late maybe because of his work but one time he didnt respond for a day. I know i might sound irritating but i just have lots of trust issues and this is the first time ever i’m talking to a guy and actually want a relationship what should i do?"
"The person [37M] I [20F] am kind of seeing has been acting odd and not reaching out to me at all. We’ve been seeing each other for a month and a half maybe two? However, I feel the feelings are not reciprocated. I *always* reach out to him first. When I do, he either takes forever to respond, gives me a short response and ignores whatever I said. I messaged him the other day and said something about how I had gotten a new second job and asked how his week was. He said it was busy then completely ignored the others things I said. The other day I asked him for help with something, he agreed and then never followed through despite having time to go out and do other crap. It started as a hook up but there are things he does (which I’m not sure if I’m misinterpreting) that kind of confuse me but lead me to think he’s just using me. 

He will ask me to pick up stuff for him that he needs, whatever it may be. Help him take up boxes or groceries. Sometimes he makes me food and asks me to hang around his house while he works and what not. But whenever I talk, I feel like I’m talking to a wall. He hardly ever listens to things I say, he texts constantly and then I’m like ?? And he’s like “oh sorry what was that?” 

The other day he showed someone a video of us without my consent. I found out once he told me that showed someone and that they had made a comment about how big my butt was or whatever. Sometimes makes comments about how I’m unrecognizable in old pics because of how thin I was (I’m more curvy now and gained a bit of pounds.) He’s mentioned he’s hooked up with his friend before who is married, and he knew it. He just seems...idk. 

People have been telling me to cut him off but for some reason I find it very hard. I know he’s toxic in a way, and I’m almost sure he’s just using me. But I find it hard. What do I do?"
"My attractive neighbor. What do I a M37 do? My neighbors window is six feet from my apartment in a lit corridor. I have often exchanged hello's with her on the street, she's gorgeous. I split with my wife a year ago and have gone without a companion ever since. Now, for six months I am addicted to seeing her and a partner fall asleep every night. He has not shown up for 8 nights now. If I ask her out and we become close should I ever tell her about my watching her for so long? I feel a bit guilty."
"my teacher tried to get my gf to cheat on me so i’ve had this teacher for a few years and never really liked her but i kept my own and was respectful, i started talking to my now current gf 2 years ago and we started dating but right before we did she told her that she could do so much better then me and that she shouldn’t date me and some other stuff i don’t want to get in to

fast forward a year and this teacher is still trying to get her to break up with me and she even went as far as telling her old crush that she liked him and told him to kiss her after class because that’s what she always wanted and he did it as i was entering the class 

to make things worst she told someone that i was cheating on her with her best friend it got around the school and we got in to a fight and about broke up but things got sorted out and we are still together. she still says bad things about me and how she can do better 

i want to do something to screw with her i have her phone number and know about where she lives any suggestions"
"My boyfriend thinks we should be friends with rapists because that’s what Jesus would do My (21F) boyfriend (20M) and I are college students living in a house with a number of other people. One of our housemates is friends with a guy named “Joe” who was accused of sexual assault a few years ago. The incident happened at a party after he and a girl had both been drinking, and later she claimed that she was too drunk to consent. The story is a bit complicated but ultimately, there wasn’t enough evidence for him to be charged. He was however forced to leave school for awhile. Now he’s back and he’s been coming over to our house recently to spend time with our housemate. After I learned of the accusation against Joe I told my housemate that I didn’t really like having Joe around the house- both because the whole think makes me uncomfortable, and because I don’t think it looks good for our house to be associated with someone accused of sexual assault. My housemate understood and said he wouldn’t invite Joe over anymore if it bothered me, and I told him I’d think about it. 

My boyfriend understands where I’m coming from, but thinks it would be wrong of me to ban Joe from our house. His reasoning is not that he thinks Joe is certainly innocent, but instead that we shouldn’t judge people for their past mistakes. He is Catholic and he says that his faith has taught him to show compassion to sinners, and therefore the right thing to do is to befriend Joe. But I think that starting a friendship with Joe would be turning a blind eye to what happened and excusing it. If Joe had acknowledged that what had happened was wrong and apologized for it I would feel differently, but from what I understand he has maintained that what he did wasn’t wrong and that the girl merely accused him because she had a boyfriend at the time and didn’t want to be caught cheating. My boyfriend says that no good will come from showing hatred to Joe and that it’s not my place to judge him or condemn him. But I’m not saying we should be mean to him or try to interfere in his life in anyway (other than possibly banning him from our house, but I don’t plan on doing that, after thinking for awhile I’ve realized I don’t think it’s fair of me). I’m just saying we shouldn’t be friends with him. My boyfriend feels bad for Joe because he’s a “nice guy” and he has very few friends, but I feel like that’s an excuse that perpetuates rape culture. He also reminded me that Jesus was friends with prostitutes and tax collectors, but I said that prostitutes are not comparable to rapists. I asked my boyfriend if he’d be willing to read and learn more about sexual assault so he could better understand where It coming from, but he said he doesn’t need to because he has learned lot about compassion from one of his faith mentors who herself is a feminist, and so he isn’t going to change his mind. This made me upset. I understand that the situation with Joe is complicated, and issues involving consent between two people who have been drinking are more nuanced than other sexual assault issues. But my boyfriend’s view that it’s not our place to judge rapists and that it’s our job to show them compassion by befriending them is frustrating to me. Joe might be innocent, but to be clear my boyfriend specifically believes that even if Joe was a violent rapist, it is still the right thing to do to be friends with him. I believe in compassion as well, but I also believe in holding members of our community accountable for their actions by not ignoring their wrongdoings. 

I just would like to hear some perspectives from outsiders on whether I am being too sensitive about this. To be fair he never said that I need to be friends with Joe or that it’s important to him, just that he thinks it’s the right thing to do. Maybe this is just an issue where he and I have different perspectives and that’s ok? Or maybe I could learn from his perspective. This is a very emotional subject for me, and perhaps I am not looking at the issue fairly. Any advice is very appreciated."

And when I have sex with her is it ok for her to do that to me?"

"I need break up advice for a tricky living situation. Hi reddit.

I need some advice. My boyfriend and I live at my parents house. We started dating a couple of years ago. Shortly into the relationship, his lease was ending and he ended up staying temporarily turned permanently with me.

I can’t afford to move out yet because I’m still a college student. My boyfriend is international and his parents surprisingly told him they afford to let him finish last year. He does not want to go back to his home country, but without being a student here, he doesn’t have legal residence and he cannot work or do much with his days. He wants to get married to fix the problem but I don’t feel like it’s a good idea for me to go through with that. We argue pretty frequently and the relationship has been very taxing on my mental health. It is very fun sometimes but it’s not been very conducive to me pursuing my goals and staying healthy. I think we’re codependent.

I have tried to break up before. But he says he has nowhere to go and needs time to figure it out. The problem is... living in the same room and being broken up is very hard to not get back together. It’s also just hard to live like that.

1. How should I approach the break up conversation?
2. How much time should I give him to move out?

I hope that I am not being insensitive but my mental health is deteriorating and I need to take care of myself. Honestly though, I’m dreading this so very much, I feel so weak. Can someone give me a bit of guidance?

TLDR: My boyfriend lives with me at my parents house and has nowhere to go when we break up. He is an international student who unexpectedly can’t afford to finish his degree. I feel responsible to help him because marriage would fix all of his problems (cheaper tuition, able to work, legal residency) but the relationship is unhealthy and making me depressed/stressed most of the time."
"“Fuck Boy” wants to have a baby with me Okay, so I can’t figure this guy out. We met about 3 years ago on a night out, and hit it off big style. And we were seeing each other pretty intensely for 3 weeks and then he went on a lads trip to Thailand and basically disappeared.  I’d only ever hear from him if he needed something or wanted a booty call. He’s a squaddy so guess I wasn’t too shocked, though did hope he’d prove me wrong. 
Though we had been seeing each other on and off since then. And every time I see him he tells me he’s in love with me, and wants something more serious, but then disappears again. And everytime Id keep giving him another chance. (Yes I know I’m a mug).

Anyway last year I found out he’s had a girlfriend the whole time.  Which explains why he kept disappearing. So a tackled him about it and called time on us. 
Though we have kept in touch on and off, but just as friends. I still care about him, and like to know he’s okay, as is quite an emotional guy. 

 Anyway about 2 months ago I ran into him on a night out, and he asked me what it is I want from him, and he said if it’s marriage he’d marry me there and then. He said that he loves me (again) and that he didn’t want to loose me again. But then the next day he acted like he hadn’t said anything. And disappeared again. 

Anyway the last few months I keep getting messages from him telling him he wants a relationship with me. That he wants us to live together blah blah blah. But I’ve told him to come find me when he’s single because I’m not being the other girl. And we’ve had the same conversation over and over, but he doesn’t change anything. 

Then yesterday I got a message from him saying “want to make a baby 😍?”. And he’s deadly serious that he wants to have a baby together. What is his game plan here, is he just upping the commitment level to try get me back into bed? Because that’s a pretty awful way to do it. Or is he genuinely insane. I’m normally pretty good at reading people, but this has got me stumped!"
"How could you not tell your kid/your sister that their Dad died?!? (Long ThrowAway acct) My (early 30s F) grandpa Gerard* (*all names used will be fake) died last week at age 88/89, and my Mom (57F) is heartbroken over the loss of her Dad. He had Alzheimer's, had been in a home, and hasn't been great for a couple years now, still sad. My Grandpa was far more loving than my Grandmother. 


Unfortunately, my Mom found out about my Grandpa's death through a sympathy card from her cousins in the mail. My mom had to literally call her cousin and ask her who died! To find out your Dad passed through a card from not-so-close relatives and then have to CALL to confirm WHO?!? Crazy! 


My Grandmother Lisa* (80F), nor my aunt (Mom's sister) Jessica* (58F) bothered to call to tell my Mom that HER DAD (also) passed. No calls, no texts, no nothing from them. 


My Grandmother Lisa has treated my Mom Sandy* differently than my aunt Jessica for their entire lives. Lisa has disowned my Mom several times over the years over stupid stuff.


The most recent reason for not speaking to my Mom is because my Mom brought Grandpa back home because she needed a break from the constant care. There were dual health concerns, both of my grandparents needed extra care, so each sibling took a parent. Mom took Grandpa 24/7 home, Jessica went to GMA Lisa's daily. My Mom needed a few days break, had been asking, been denied, ignored calls and texts, etc. So Mom took Grandpa home for a break, she wanted a few days. Lisa, Jessica, and everyone else stopped speaking to us since that moment. 


Lisa has disowned my Mom probably a dozen times over the years for days/weeks/months/now years over numerous stupid shit like not returning calls or disagreeing with her about something. Lisa and Jessica haven't gone more than 10 days without speaking, ever. Everytime Lisa and my Mom stop speaking, she stops speaking to me. Whatever. 


So.... 2 years ago when this whole 'Mom needs a break' incident went down, I've stopped trying to connect to my Grandmother, Jessica, her husband and kid, just done with that narcissism and whatnot. My life is way better without them in it. My Mom has chosen the same, but chose to visit Grandpa in the nursing home. They caused drama with nursing home visits too. However, I'm angry and I am considering yelling at my extended family. 


So Reddit... What do I do? Do I break my 2 year silence, give them a big piece of my mind, tell them what garbage they are, or not? Thoughts? Letter, call, nothing? 


TLDR; My messed up grandmother and aunt didn't tell my mom and I about grandpa's death for over a week and I'm pissed the F off about it. 


Throwaway account because like... This will clearly give me away probably already.

Edit: nevermind, not on my throwaway. Whatever."
"[17 M] Should i be looking to date during quarantine? So basically, I started talking to this girl today and the responses aren't dry, but because of the health risks rn she can't go out to hang out. What should I do?"
"Short tempered by stupidity. What to do? I think the title says it all for me for more context read below 

I don’t get easily triggered mostly I’m chill and down to earth dude. But when it comes to stupidity and feeling that the person infront of me isn’t understanding the basic things I’m saying i get frustrated and it takes 15 to brush it off and mostly it becomes obvious on my face and i take a side not to show my anger.

"My (23m) gf (23f) was raped before I met her, but also has a rape kink and wants me to fulfill it. What should I do? Me and my gf have been together not far off a year. We're very active sexually and have what I consider to be a good sex life. Whenever I ask her if she wants me to anything new or if she's satisfied she insists she's happy with how I perform.

However, she told me a story a while back about how she was raped. She ""doesn't really consider it rape"" as she, in her words not mine, ""let it happen"". Long story short, the guy pinned her down on a couch when she was at a party and forced her pants down, but she keeps saying she didn't do anything really to stop him so it wasn't really rape.

I want to also add, I consider what he did rape, but have not encouraged her to seek retribution nor have I pursued it myself. She isn't fixated on it and doesn't talk about it much, and it hasn't seemed to affect her at all.

Now here is my question: What do I say to her when she actually asks me to rape her?

She says she often has fantasies about me forcing myself on her. I am pretty dominant in bed and enjoy some rough play myself so normally would have no issue fulfilling such requests as long as there was complete trust and communication between the two of us, and she had a way to make clear to me that she was not comfortable and wanted to stop. In her situation (even though as I said, she almost never talks about it and makes clear it doesn't affect her when she does) I often hesitate when we have sex to get TOO insistent or rough in case it brings up bad memories.

What do I do? Do I refuse or fulfill her request? Any advice is appreciated."
"How do I tell a female friend that she is in a toxic relationship? (I'll call my friend Claire and his boyfriend Steven for simplicity).

So what happens is that Steven is separating Claire from everyone that talks bad from him, to her (he has all his accounts passwords, IG, Snapchat, etc) and doesn't let her speak to anyone without his permission. Steven also asks her to give him all the homework from school that Claire has done by herself, and when she says, no he threatens her by saying that he's gonna commit suicide or change her passwords, etc.

I'm in no way interested in getting into a relationship with her, I'm only worried about his mental state.

What do I do?"
"How to overcome envy I’m currently in a relationship which is very important for me. We are both financially dependent on our parents. The thing is that my girlfriend has a laptop much better than mine, which she doesn’t even need. I mean, I’m a cs student and computers are both a passion and a need for me, but because we don’t have much money my laptop is old and troublesome. While she has last MBP which she uses for basic things, she doesn’t need this power at all. I absolutely hate this feeling, I hate myself for feeling that, but I can’t stop thinking about how unfair it is. I can’t even talk to her about this because of disgust to myself."
"My friend ignores my messages and calls me delusional anytime I message her offended? She is pissing me off. I haven’t seen her in like a year. Last time I saw her the girl was really rude to me and they talked about me not tipping at a restaurant and the girl she was with was super mean to me then I saw she unfollowed me on IG. She basically said really rude stuff to me when I had a lot of family stress going on and they both live off their moms when I am on my own! 

A previous friend who I got mad at contacted my friend on Facebook writing a message about me claiming I harassed her when I cut ties with her. My friend never even talks to her. Then I see one of our other friends blocked me and that my friend is hanging out with her!

I don’t even talk to these people that unfriended me or blocked me yet she talks to me like I did anything to them and is the one hanging out with them. Then when I message her offended and send her a bunch of messages, she ignores them all

Literally her only response to anything has been ignoring me then saying “you have issues and are delusional because of the number of messages you have sent me and then blocked me” 

She claims to not have an issue with me but I’m getting annoyed she won’t communicate or maybe she is being dishonest about something."
"I have lost all sense of my sexuality and need advice!? This is my first post but I really need some advice, so first a bit of background.

Names-
Younger brother - YB
mom’s ex - ED
Step cousin - SC


Ever since I (f14) was born I had never met a homosexual person and didn’t know about this type of thing till I was around 6. anyways, when I turned 5 my mom, me and YB moved into a small town and into a house with ED. ED had 4 kids and a sister with one daughter (their step cousin (SC)) when they all visited we would play families, with me and SC as the parents, but during this as we were young we would play out this game as a reality and kiss. Of course as children you don’t think much of it but this is where my confusion began.

Fast forward 9 years when I am 14, I was asked out a few times (by guys) and accepted. At first I just did it because I thought it was what everyone else did but after losing my v-card I realised that each person I dated, I never really had any emotional attachment to them and even tho I told that I liked/loved them, nothing really ever made me feel those butterflies in my stomach or that head spinning feeling that people talk about when they are dating. 

With quarantine I have had time to rethink stuff and look at things from different angles. But it wasn’t until recently that I realised i have never truly loved anyone I just dated them in order to fit in (and I know I shouldn’t but at the time I thought that was what happened with everyone I do apologise for playing with their emotions whether I acknowledged it or not). After rethinking all the event I have lived through I discovered that the possibility of being gay has always been a choice in my mind and I have asked people their opinions but I never thought anything more, i do look at guys and think they are attractive and even imagine dating them (in that cliche girl thought way) but I have done the same with girls except I did that without realising. But what all of this has in common is that I have never “fallen in love” with either gender, I haven’t fallen for anyone at all so this is what confuses me. 

I have kissed a girl and I have done ‘it’ with a boy but from what I can remember is that it never made my stomach ‘flip’ (as they say). I admit I have seen homosexual couples over the years and see those people happy with their choice and looking at this I get that ‘flip’ feeling but when it comes to me and people who like me I can’t experience that joy and love as if I can’t accept my own choice or the person themselves. In all honesty those childish “kisses” were what made me begin learning about LGBTQ+ and we’re what caused me to think this. I have asked many types of people for advice or how they came to know their sexuality and they all described it as from the day they knew about relationships it just clicked or that they knew when they did ‘stuff’ but I can’t understand these feelings and they confuse me a lot.

So if you have any suggestions or advice feel free to comment."
My(29f) boyfriend (20m) asked if I want kids in the future? What does this mean? My boyfriend of 4 months and I were face timing and he brought up the subject of having children and if I wanted any in the future. He said he did but hes not ready as of now. Why did he bring this up? We have only met in person once ad it is a LDR but we have an unbelievable connection. He is only 20 and he has even talked about how his kids would be raised and if I agreed. It seems like a very serious topic? Maybe hes just in love?
"Why So last night I asked a girl out on a date she’s a nice girl and I’ve been talking to her for a while, she started asking questions like when and what we’d be doing I was really excited about it because let’s just say I’ve been rejected over twenty times for petty reasons like your ginger or you wear glasses but anyway she led me on and then said she couldn’t coz she’s in a relationship now let me tell you this we’re both 15 and she’s in a long term relationship with a guy she knew in Australia I am pretty mad rn and don’t know what to do please help."
"He wants to end things because he is severely depressed I (32F) have been through many ups and downs with him (36F) over the last 6 years. He has recently gone back to drinking (he’s an alcoholic) after being sober for 4 months. We no longer live together but he doesn’t want to be around me. He says he can’t worry about my happiness when he can’t even find his. He has been diagnosed with chronic depression, anxiety, and PTSD so I am just scared that he is making a long term decision based on how he is feeling right now. I don’t want to not speak or break things off but he keeps saying thats the healthiest thing for both of us. I am willing to wait but he is adamant so I don’t know what to think. Thoughts?"
"People are blocking and unfriending me on social media and I don't know why I don't know why it bothers me so much but its probably because I don't know why , in the last 3ish years I've noticed people unfollowing me , unfriending me and blocking me ... Its not like I share anything rude or horrid infact I don't share much only photos of my family and friends.  All of those who have unfriended me are not people I've fell out with etc and would say hello to me in the street but that makes me question are they being fake to me in person ... it just hurts I feel like I'm annoying and yet I don't know how ..."
"I get jealous when he talks about losing his virginity with another girl TLDR AT BOTTOM 
The topic of virginity in my opinion matters okay? Dont try to say it doesn't. Me and my boyfriend were both stupid to give it to the wrong people (we admitted that). But please try not to say things like how virginity shouldn't matter and such. To me it does and I already feel dissatisfied/disappoint in myself/past self for giving it to someone who thought I was going to have a future with.. someone who promised they would spent the rest of their life with me. Anyway... 

When we were talking about the girl he lost his virginity to, he said she was thin.. she was a burnette/red head and such. He was describing things about her that (I think) were a lot better traits then me.. I'm chubby (fluffy as he calls it) not skinny... and at times I hate it. I hate myself. I know I shouldn't think of it because it's the past/especially his past. Plus I'm even thinking of it the other way around. Him feeling a type of way when I talk about when I had my first time. But it STILL bothers me and makes me jealous wishing I could be his first.. 

TL;DR: I'm jealous and a bit upset because I wish I could've been my boyfriends first time. Plus him describing her, makes me uncomfortable about myself."
"I can’t decide whether I want to hold or move on. Me (M20) &amp; her (F19) have been broken up for about 4 months. 

We held no hatred, we didn’t end it fighting, but given the circumstances, then, there was no other way.

The romance had ended up one sided. Specifically, I was alone in holding onto her, because I didn’t really understand what was happening on her side.

The truth is I treated her well &amp; I was there for her, but she just never fell for me the way I did for her. (We are young, so intensity on both sides is very significant)

We may be as young as it gets, but I felt some very real love for her, which goes on until today. She loved me too &amp; continues to do so.

Once in quarantine, however, she started getting in touch with me, in a way that revealed more and more that she missed me. 

I felt she was being lonely &amp; she probably couldn’t take it for much more.. I was replying to her, but throughout this quarantine, I’ve been really heartbroken from losing her. So, I wasn’t prolonging the conversations. I was just asking her if she was okay, I was greeting her family &amp; listening to her news now and then. 

After a point in time though, I’d just get miserable every time her thought would pop in my mind. I’ve been very lonely too. So I didn’t want us to keep texting like this, because nothing would change and we couldn’t really discuss anything relative until we met face to face.

So I asked her when she’s coming back to the city where we both study, she asked me why &amp; I replied that I just want us to meet.

That’s all she needed. She didn’t text me again. Now, we’re probably meeting in a couple of weeks. 

I have weighed the situation &amp; if she can prove me something substantial has changed, I do want to be with her. If not, I cannot sustain another breakup with her, since it’ll probably be even worse on our health. My trust is shook, even if she never really cheated on me or anything. 

I don’t know how I should approach this meeting of ours. Having in mind how I can give us a second chance if we pursue each other or if not, how I can tell her I love her, I want her in my life but not until we’ve both healed and moved on.

TL:DR —&gt; I broke up with my ex months ago because she wasn’t in love with me. I was heartbroken, but couldn’t hold anything against her, although my trust was bent anyway. She missed me during quarantine, started contacting me and we’re meeting in 2 weeks. Part of me wants us to try again and have the situation changed, because we do love each other. The other part knows that, most likely, she got lonely being alone in quarantine &amp; she’ll move on once her life gets back on track. How should I approach our meeting? I don’t want any rush decisions, because even if we get involved again, I cannot sustain another even worse breakup with her, the way I’ve been feeling since the first one.

Thanks a ton for your time! I wish you keep loving your loved ones, no matter how things turn out!"
I need to “reserve” my kitchen for a quarantine date We’re doing a zoom date and cooking something together. But I need the kitchen alone. I’m also not totally comfortable with the idea of telling my parents I’m on a date (living with them for time being). I want to keep it to myself for now...One option is to tell my brother and get him to help me here. I can’t get away with “cooking with a friend”. Any advice??
"My exboyfriend(24M) hasn't been receptive my to attempts to fix the relation between me(23F) and his daughter 3 years ago I was in a relationship with this amazing man. He was loving and great and we got along really well. 

A couple of months into our relationship I got pregnant. My ex was happy and we planned on raising the baby together.  My ex and I had agreed in the beginning that we would have an open relationship so I was sleeping with a couple of other people on the side. 

A couple of months into my pregnancy my sister told my ex that she doubted the baby was his because of a couple of conversations I had with her in private. I never claimed the baby wasn't his but she just assumed that I from my doubts. My ex blew up when my sister told him and he claimed that I cheated on him and that he wasn't going to raise the child that wasn't his and I couldn't even get a word in and was crying. I couldn't understand why he he said that especially because we had an open relationship this whole time so I couldn't understand where this was all coming from. We exchanged a few texts after that but he just gave one word answers and told me to never talk to him again. I spent the rest of my pregnancy trying to contact him as I am still in love with him and kept sending him updates on our child. He didn't block my number but just left me on read.

Throughout the past few years I have been trying to get him to talk to me and have been trying to fix our relationship. My sister is on his side for some reason but the rest of my family just tells me to go after him for child support and to get over him. I feel like going after him for child support might damage our relationship further and would ruin my chances to i have decided to not do that.

Up until recently my ex never responded to any of my messages or emails and even moved apartments. Recently though I managed to get his sisters phone number and she blew up and told me to stop harassing him and to leave. I've been in tears since. I have only been trying to rekindle our relationship and he's been ignoring my attempts and I want that to stop. How do I fix our relationship?"
"I don't know if I love my (21m) boyfriend Wel live together with 2 other friends, I enjoy living with them. I don't mind being in a relationship with him, and I'm comfortable with him. But if I think about it in the long run I can't see us being together, getting engaged, or anything of the sort. In fact I have to try not and think about it if the thought pops up.

I'm not too sure if that means I love him or not? Any advice or insight would be great, if you need more information lemme know!"
"I [22F] feel like my boyfriend [23M] is constantly pretending to have the same values, political views, future plans, etc. as me I have been dating my boyfriend for almost three years now and in that time, I've expressed wanting to break up multiple times due to what I perceived to be irreconcilable world views. He grew up in a small town in the Midwestern U.S., while I've lived in multiple countries and cities throughout my childhood and adulthood. He had a very stable childhood in an upper-middle-class family while I had a very chaotic upbringing in a family with a lot of financial ups-and-downs and abuse. I won't go into long descriptions of what our different values are, but I will say that we are both the products of our respective environments. 

My boyfriend met me at a time when I was a teenager trying to escape my past. I moved out to the Midwest to attend college in the same town he grew up in, and that's where we met. In the beginning months of our relationship, I looked at my new surroundings with rose-tinted glasses and didn't see everything for what it was—all I knew was that I was no longer with my toxic family and to me, that was enough for everything to be wonderful. 

Now that it's been a few years I'm starting to realize what a terrible fit this environment is for me. I still feel fine with my classmates and professors and my everyday life in general, but I know I want to get away from here. My boyfriend now has an office job near where I go to school and says that he understands, because he wants to get away from here, too; I don't doubt him on that, but I think our ideas of ""getting away"" are very different. 

For my boyfriend, ""getting away"" means the stereotypical small-town-kid-makes-it-in-the-big-city story. He wants to get an MBA and work on Wall Street or something. He is constantly obsessing over his LinkedIn and making sure he is projecting a successful image to his old high school classmates. If he moved out of his childhood town, he would be the first in his family to do so for generations. To me, ""getting away"" means going back to my roots, getting my teaching license, and working with kids that might be struggling from the same things I once did. No interest in ""making it big""; I just want to make some impactful difference in others' lives. 

My boyfriend is slowly starting to realize we don't have the same values and visions in life. He used to always joke that he wanted to ""make the rich richer and the poor poorer."" I used to laugh at this characterization of a career in finance, but I don't laugh anymore. I've tried to break up with him several times over these differences but every time he gets hurt and says I must think he's a really selfish, greedy person. And we never actually break up. 

In the past year, he's been trying to present himself as someone more in line with my values. He suddenly changed who he supported in the democratic primaries. He started volunteering with kids on the weekends, and he complains. All. The. Time. I know working with kids is really frickin hard but I can tell he gets absolutely nothing out of it. There's other things, too, that I won't get into.

I honestly don't buy into any of it at all. I've told him before that I feel like he's just camouflaging himself to be who I want him to be, and every time he vehemently denies it. I told this to one of my friends and she said, ""People change."" Yeah, people change, but I really don't think this is genuine. And I don't want him to have a miserable life doing things that I want to do when he really wants to do other things. His volunteer job might make him miserable, but he genuinely lights up when he's talking about his corporate job. 

I don't know what to do. I just want him to be honest with me but I don't know how to start a conversation without making him feel hurt that I think he's ""selfish."" And no matter which way I try to approach the conversation, he always denies that we have different values/visions and argues against what I have to say. Any advice on how to effectively have this conversation would be much appreciated."
"My boyfriend is filming me during sex. So me (F21) and my boyfriend (M22) have been in a relationship for about 5 months now. About 2 months into the relationship we were having sex in reverse cowgirl and I heard his phone make that record sound. I didn’t make a deal of it because if he’s just filming me for himself then I don’t really care, I’d just appreciate him asking. Then a few days ago we were having sex in the same position again and I looked back to see him holding his phone pointed at me, to which he swiftly hid it. After we finished he commented on how when we were having sex his friend started messaging him. I just found it odd how he felt the need to clarify so specifically, and it seemed like he was lying just my the tone of his voice and how he was really being specific on who was texting him and how it’s so weird because it was so late. Seemed a little forced. Again. I don’t mind if he wants to film me I’m just looking for some advice on how to bring it up in a way that doesn’t cause any tension. Thank you."
"Should I be jealous of my boyfriend's best friend or am I overreacting? My boyfriend has a female best friend that he always posts on his WhatsApp status and almost always has as his profile picture. I understand that they're best friends but I'm still a bit jealous so I changed one of my friends contact names to that of a guy and he saw a message she sent me that had hearts and he starting talking to me about how I would feel if he had a female friend that he talked to like that so I then brought up what he was doing and asked how he would feel if I did that and he then realized what he had done and apologized. He promised not to do it again and posted my picture instead but a few days later he removed it and started posting her again. She has a picture of the two of them together in her profile picture and posts him too but her number one best friend is also a guy and she NEVER posts him. My friends even noticed and asked me about it. What should I do? I confronted him and he apologized, should I just forget about it or still be upset?"
"Dating multiple people: need advice I (26F) have never been one to date multiple people at the same time. 
I typically go on quite a few first dates with various guys and there will be one that really sticks out, and I will hyperfocus- drop the rest- get tunnel vision.
And in my experience I tend to put them on a pedestal because of this, get way too deep way too quick, and it comes crashing down within a month or so.
This has been the last 2-3 relationships for me.

Fast forward to now.

This is the first time I’ve really been intentional with NOT repeating the same things I have done in my past in the hopes that I can build something more sustainable and long lasting.

What it’s now resulted in is me dating two different guys for the last month. (About 4 dates each). I really like both of them, and am very interested in continuing to get to know each of them. 

I also have been semi talking to a third guy, and have plans to meet him coming up. 

I am in such a level headed place about the two guys and feel like I’m seeing them in a clear light which is so refreshing! I’m excited about them, but not obsessed like I usually am. 

*I have not been intimate with either**

I kind of feel a bit confused about it though. 

1. Even though I’m excited and level headed this doesn’t feel as fun as when I get all wrapped up in the whirl wind of my old tunnel-vision self. Which in turn makes me question if I really can see myself with either of them long term. I know rationally that the passion I have been used to feeling is mostly because of my poor habits but still it’s hard. Any advice there?

2. Do I let them know I am seeing other people? Idk for me in my past once it’s like date 4 or 5, consistently seeing a guy, I just kind of assume we’re focusing in on each other and that he’d say so otherwise. 

3. For those of you who date multiple people when do you typically get clarity on who to start focusing in on??? 

4. When do you stop introducing new people into your dating circle? Like should I even meet this third guy? 

This is hard. 

TLDR : dating multiple people, need advice"
"Should I(43M) respond to my ex(48F)?  

So my ex-wife and I haven't talked to each other in a couple years. Today she mentioned me in a post on FB. I feel conflicted about responding to it. I dunno. feels like if I don't I might be holding on to some residual anger that I shouldn't be. What would you suggest I do?"
"Need help understanding So I told a female that I like her, she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship. I decided to give her some space and not talk to her as she’s going through stuff and whatnot. Decided to message her after she left the group call abruptly (I didn’t pay attention to her the whole day) she said goodnight and then changed her status to “James &lt;3” and appeared offline hiding her status. (We’re on discord) 

She’s got a track record of saying things around me all of a sudden like talking about wanting to marry another person to make me jealous but then will suddenly call me her boyfriend etc. 

People have said that she’s playing games, not really sure."
"Separate bedrooms? I (21F) am moving in with my boyfriend (26M) of two years coming up in July and we are talking about everything we want moving forward. Originally we planned to just get our own places near each other because we spent a long time dating sort of long distance (about an hour from each other). However, because of circumstances with my family kicking me out and covid preventing a proper income to save, we decided moving in together was the smartest financial choice. I have never really lived on my own before, besides in a dorm or in a small townhome with a friend where it didn't work out. 
This will kind of be my first time ""on my own"" and I still want that sense of independence and my own room instead of a shared one. I floated this idea by my boyfriend and he supports it and understands, but I just wanted some advice on how to make this work, and what possible issues could come from this if any. I've always thought it was the norm to stay in the same room, but I've seen some of you on here talking about your 10 year happy marriage with separate bedrooms and that kind of put the idea in my head. 

For those of you who have done this, what makes it work? What doesn't? Would any of you advise against this? Is this smart? It feels right for us, but it also just feels taboo. Thanks in advance."
"Lonesome Hi y’all, I’m wondering if you could help me out.  I know tons of us are separated from our SO’s right now cause of everything that happened with this quarantine.  My boyfriend and I have been separated for almost 2 months now. I had to come home to take care of family a few hours away before it all started and then got stuck here, before this we were together almost everyday.  It’ll be a while still till we see each other and I’m very lonesome.  

We talk daily, FaceTime every other day and have dates at least 1-2x a week.  He’s amazing and I love him but I still miss him a ton.  

So what do I do when this sadness hits?  I’m crying a lot, I’m feeling insecure and I find myself stressing over small things. 

What do you do?"
"I don't know how to live a life where my ex isn't my significant other anymore. We'd been together for eight years up until yesterday where they told me as gently as they could that in the state they're in emotionally (too immature for a relationship, too unable to meet social obligations due to depression, etc, things I've been aware of for years) and that they'd like to end our romantic relationship. They've expressed a want for me to move on romantically, to explore other people, to 'let my heart move on,' and that, potentially, years from now, there's the chance for us to rekindle after they've given themselves a chance to become a better lover and person, we can 'rekindle' in his words what we had.   


I don't...**know** if this is an entirely honest thought, and I, being cruel and selfish, asked him outright what he would do if he found himself improved but had affections for another person, whether he'd reach out to me again, settle for what he had, so on. He said he didn't know, which is an entirely answer, but I think ultimately means he'd stand by wherever his heart stood at the time rather than 'come back' to me. I think it's more likely that he offers the chance to get back together mostly to protect me emotionally, and it's probably foolish to entertain that thought because of the way people change, but it's one I'm hopeful for all the same even as I fully intend on taking their advice and exploring other parts of me, other people, mainly so that I can work with some amount of emotional stability and optimism until I've found a place to stand steadily without him as a crutch.  


The issue is that I don't even know what that means, or, worse, I very much remember what it means, and I hate it.  


I used to get beat up a lot in Middle School, often times to the point of nearly being injured, suffering a concussion at some point - and another time being the subject of sexual assault by a group of girls -  and was in an incredibly lonely, harsh place before he and I met and really 'found' one another romantically. When I say I had 'no' friends in school, I mean that entirely literally. Most days I was completely silent without saying a word other than when I was saying something venomous or hateful to another student who made a teasing remark at me. I ate lunch alone, I didn't interact with any of my peers in class, and during reccess I would pace around the perimeter of the blacktop or wait by the door until it ended where some of the supervising teachers were to make sure I avoided any of the usual suspects of students who bullied me frequently. I would dream and fantasize of going home and playing Final Fantasy 10 and World of Warcraft, dreading and hating going to sleep because it'd mean I have to repeat it until going home again, carrying this horrid feeling in my gut when report cards went home because of how poorly I was doing.  


I'm...mostly over this. I've forgiven them for it as best I can, reached out to a few to see how they're doing, those I remembered the names of, acknowledged that whatever lives they have at home were probably much worse than what they were doing to me at school, even the worst of it, but that's not really the point. That's the only life I've had prior to him, and, I think, unconsciously and consciously, I'm terrified of that being the only alternative.   


This is who I was and what I had before I met him. Which is to say...basically nothing. I still 'have' him. He still wants to hang out, spend time together, do all the things we did before, just without the romantic context or implication to it, the monogamy. I have other friends too. Other friends I want to spend more time with, even if the time with them feels...like nothing spent with him. I think when we spend time together I'll feel better, that I'll 'remember' that I haven't been pushed away, but what I'm worried about is the **years** that lay ahead without him.  


As it stands now I'm trying to force myself to be on some sort of schedule where I don't allow my mind to mull and engage itself in my dark thoughts. I go on walks a lot. I watch cat videos. Watch movies and television with family. Chat with friends, try to force myself to hold meaningful conversations with people about plans. I cry randomly a few times a day. Especially when I allow my thoughts to wander into thinking about what I could've done differently, what speech I could've gave to make him change his mind, what I could say now to make him change his mind, I think about blaming him and yelling at him that he's being unfair, what his 'protecting me' is putting me through. They're unhealthy and unproductive but a constant presence all the same that I keep myself busy and positive to avoid getting stuck in. We're still friends. He's going to be a better person by the end of it. Maybe, if God allows and him allows, be a better boyfriend even by the end of it. I'm not ruined without him, even if it feels like it. One day I will go to bed, or wake up, eat breakfast, and do my morning routine and realize I didn't think about how much it really sucks. And then I will be able to move on.  


But I don't really know how to start onto that path beyond just...mechanically forcing myself to ignore it, occasionally allowing myself to embrace my emotions so I don't keep them locked up in the proverbial barn and choking on them.  


I'd mostly just like advice, as someone who's an introvert and enjoys having a select few friends whose presence I appreciate, how to move on when...this happens, and how I can explore myself when the urge to do so doesn't even exist."
"Relationships vs Doing what I want! I have been really hesitant to post this because I don't know how to frame this.
I really love traveling and I know for a fact that when the time comes (at around 25yrs of age) I will be able to travel. I know this might seem like a stretch with me claiming an age but trust me, I can only travel when I am of that age because I would like to pursue other interests when I am younger (currently)

I also want to be in a relationship with someone who loves me as much as I love them. I want to feel warmth and safety when I am with them.

I don't mind travelling with an SO but finding someone who loves me isn't easy either.


I know this is a ramble but I want to get some half decent advice on this. 


I have re read it and it seems stupid and naive but it is what it is."
"How to cut ties with family? I'm a minor so I still live with my parents, our relationship is very toxic and once I turn 18 I want to try move out and cut ties with them. I have researched ways to do it but I just want better advice then it gave me. Any advice is welcomed or even just tips for the few years I have to wait until I can legally move out is much appreciated."
"I (23F) spent the night with the guy (25M) I’ve been talking to for a few weeks now and tried to yano...  I’ve recently started to try and date again and a mutual friend of mine confessed feelings for me, and we’ve always been sort of comfy around one another and have been able to share laughs and such. We started talking and there was a sort of spark we both felt. We’ve been texting and hanging out frequently. The other night I stayed the night with him. After eating a dinner we made together, we went to his room to watch a movie. He started cuddling me, kissing my shoulders and neck, we sort of just experienced each other’s body’s for a bit, and then we starting kissing, and he began to finger me on his own, that was sort of enjoyable, but I did have to help guide him to my clitoris, and even then.. it didn’t really work, it was okay, but not anything amazing. I got on top of him kissing him some more, grinding on him, I could feel a bulge so I said “I’m ready if you are” and he said “yeah let’s go.” I was ready to do so except he seemed to have immediately lost his erection. I started rubbing on him doing anything in my mind to arouse him and it didn’t seem to work. He eventually got hard for a minute or two after I kissed his neck and let him finger me more, but it didn’t last and unfortunately we gave up on having sex for the evening. I excused myself to the restroom to clean up and finish myself off. When I returned he seemed apologetic, but we then just snuggled and went to sleep. 
He’s texted me in the days since wanting to hangout more, but after the other night I’ve been feeling unsure about how things have been. I know that I’m a very sexually affectionate person and need a partner that will be just as sexually inclined. He is a great person but I’m asking myself if I will be sexually satisfied at the end of the day. 

Has anyone overcome sexual incompatibility? Am I overthinking things and have misjudged a possibly nervous guy who’s an actual beast in the sheets?? I’m unsure of my next steps and any advice is greatly appreciated."
"Who has a success story about repairing their relationship after a huge breach of trust? Looking for something other than the usual “just give up and leave!” Because I don’t think that’s the way to handle a relationship. When you really truly loved someone, but lost a lot of trust in them, how did you get that back? How are you now?

EDIT: it seems like many people are getting from this that I was cheated on. That’s not the case, just to clarify, but I agree that that’s hard if even possible to bounce back from."
"Hubs Fantasies.. I posted this in r/marriage so I apologize if you read it twice. See additional info at the bottom that wasn’t in other post:

Throw away for obvious reasons.. on mobile.. blah blah 

The hubs (41M) and I (40F) have been married a dozen years. We have a bunch of kids. I’m current a SAHM and he works a job he loves. Finances are very tight but we scrape by. All in all, things are good. He constantly reminds me I’m his best friend and how beautiful and sexy he thinks I am and I’m still very much in love as if we’ve been married 12 days instead of 12 years. 

Last year my parents moved in with us. They’re pretty great and everyone gets along so this has never been an issue. 

Frequently the hubs or I will throw out a random question to the other varying from “If you could go back and be anyone in the past who would you be and why” to “which of your exes would you give a second chance and why”... This week he wanted to know my sex fantasies. The truth is, I don’t have any. Frankly between the kids and housework and bills and life.. I don’t even think about sex until he’s half undressed. I told him as much and he was fine with that. I asked his and we got off topic and it was dropped.

Fast forward to tonight, we’re in bed and I can see where things are heading but say “You never did tell me about your fantasies” Things continue to progress and he waits until we are mid-act to say “Do you want me to tell you now?”... uhm.. I guess 🤷🏼‍♀️ We’ve always been fairly open with each other and talking during sex isn’t odd for us. I want to be a safe space but wasn’t expecting this- 
He goes on to describe fantasies involving my best friend and my mom. (Not together). He would also never act on these and that’s half the “fun” of fantasizing is knowing it’s safe and would never happen. 

I don’t even have words right now. My girl friend? Eh ok.. whatever. But my MOM?? I’m not as much turned off as I am incredibly hurt by this. How do I put this aside and move past it? He thinks everything is totally fine and I just want to cry.

Edit: He wanted to have sex last night and it was a serious struggle to get through for me. So even though it’s been two days, this is still bothering me. I look nothing like my mom and only slightly like my friend. I’m long blonde, green eyes, 5’3”, mom is short dark hair, brown eyes, 5’8” &amp; 150lbs heavier. Both have a larger bra size than I but they also weigh more- it’s body proportion 🤷🏼‍♀️ However I’m not small chested by any far stretch of the imagination. (Breast size played into the fantasies which is why I mention it now)"
"Friendly or flirting in a conversation with me (21F) and this guy (23M)? Inputs wanted!!! Hi. I (21F) am currently talking to a guy (23M) over text who I met within my college class. We have been talking for a few weeks now and text often. How do I know if he is flirting with me (over text) or if he is just being friendly?

Is there any giveaways that make it obvious that a guy is flirting with you versus trying to become friends? Thanks."
"Am I [23F] overreacting or is my boyfriend [23M] overly materialistic? What should I do  

Hello. I \[23F\] wanted to know if I was overreacting over my boyfriend \[23M\] who seems to be overly materialistic.

All he ever does is shop online, talk about shopping, and talks about himself. Mind you the things he buys and wants to buy aren't cheap! They are all brand name things, cars, and expensive watches. Also it's not like he has a lot of money or anything.

Whenever we are together or even when we are just texting or calling he talks about the things he has and wants. What he intends to buy and when. It is SO ANNOYING. He never has a conversation with me. Whenever I try to change the subject and talk about something I am going through or anything in general he manages to change it back to HIM...

Not to mention he rubs it in. Like I don't mind not shopping but why rub it in to your girlfriend? It's not like he's going to buy me anything. (which again I do not mind) I work hard for my money so I like the satisfaction of buying something myself.

Even with what's going on people losing jobs (I do not have a job at the moment) he is telling me to take out my money I have been saving to go shopping... I got mad I told him I found him to be insensitive to me and my situation. I don't have the freedom to be shopping around especially with no job. Asked him to stop talking about shopping and to stop shoving down my throat the things he bought and will buy.

I am pretty sure he got butt hurt because he left me on read.

I just can't deal with his materialistic mindset. I have brought this up many times to no avail. He even said before that he will save money and stop being so materialistic. Clearly he cannot do that.

Any advice?"
"My (26M) boyfriend isn't seeing me (26F) in person because of COVID19 concerns I've been dating my boyfriend for the past 9 months now. He's been great, very supportive, kind, motivating me etc. Since the pandemic happened, we haven't seen each other. We went on a big trip to Boston the week the country shut down. I'm a nurse that works in a major hospital, but I don't work with Covid patients. He's immunocompromised because of his autoimmune condition. Since my hospital does have a lot of patients with the virus, he's decided that seeing me may not be the best idea. He lives with his family still and they're elderly with underlying issues. We've been video chatting and calling on the phone, but it's not the same as seeing each other. He's suggested we go to a park and walk kinda further away from each other and not touch for the time being. He says he's afraid of bringing it home to his family.

However, he's not being fair to me. I have my own needs too. I want to hug him, kiss him, have sex etc. I go to the park and see happy couples and it makes me want to cry. I told him that he needs to get over the anxiety about this virus and his family's anxiety and concerns. He's a grown man who shouldn't have to listen to them. He's going back to work in two weeks and he's upset and afraid. He works from home now and he's concerned that he will get it because half of his workplace got a mild case of COVID19. I honestly think that the worst of this is over and he needs to buck up and deal with it. He's likely not going to get sick and he'll be fine if he even does. I told him to move in with me or move out but says that's a bad idea currently because he just got a pay cut/barely survived being furloughed. He gets his groceries delivered to his home, so he doesn't have to go out. 

I love him to death, but I'm getting impatient/feeling neglected by him because of this. Intimacy is my main love language, and it's really hurting me that he's not seeing me in person. I understand that it's a pandemic, but I don't think he has an excuse to avoid seeing me in person anymore. 

What should I do/tell him about this whole situation?

tl;dr: my boyfriend isn't seeing me because he's concerned he'll catch the virus from me. He's immunocompromised and has elderly family members who have underlying conditions that he lives with. He's a grown ass man but still listens to his family and their concerns. We video call and voice call but it just doesn't feel like enough for me. What should I do about this/tell him?"
"Any advice on how to approach this situation? I (26M) have recently been seeing this girl (23F) but we've decided that we are better off as friends since she's ready to for a baby and I'm hesitant. I do have deep feelings for her but I just never wanted kids but being with her seriously made me consider it. 

Anyway after we decided to be friends I kind of became distant and honestly I didn't know what to say to her to begin with and I didn't message her for a few days until I saw her post a status with her cutting herself. I messaged her and told her I'm here to talk if she wants but she said that I didn't want to talk to her in the first place and that we should stop talking altogether.

I explained to her that I was just trying to figure out what to say to her cause I still have feelings for her and it's tough for me to just go back to being friends but she just said again that we should stop talking and that she doesn't want to have to block me.

I honestly want to fix things between us and maybe come to a common ground but I don't know how to approach the situation."
"Is it bad that I don’t like one of my boyfriend’s friends? Hi there. This is my first time posting here and I just wanna know if it’s bad that I don’t like a friend of my boyfriend’s. I like his other friends I really don’t mind them but there’s just this one friend he has that bothers me a ton. He smokes weed and does other drugs and before I dated my bf, he was high and told this one girl he kinda liked to “f*ck off” and that he’s got “a ton of b*tches” and that’s what scares me the most. It scares me that he’ll tell me this if I ever talk to him when he’s high. He only smokes when that friend is around and just hearing him say he’s gonna be with him gives me a lot of anxiety. I don’t wanna deal with him telling me the same things, but I love this guy. I’m just always scared he’s gonna get high when that specific friend is around. I need some advice. Thank you."
Is it messed up to tell your girlfriend...... Is it messed up to tell your girlfriend you'll text her later cause your gunna play video games with your friends ?? But like everyday
"I sent exchanged nudes last night with my best friend. Now I’m sensing some awkwardness. What do I do? Let me preface this by saying I am 20/F and virgin, my best friend 21/M has had a few past partners but nothing crazy, like 2 or 3 girls he’s ever been with. We’ve been good friends since high school, like sophomore year. Our friendship is very flirty, but up until recently I thought it was all a joke. I’ve always secretly liked him, he jokes about how we should just date and i should send him nudes and stuff..

So we exchanged nudes last night. It was nice, not as awkward as I thought! Everything seemed fine, he came, we switched back to imessage from snapchat and things got weird.

We’re not talking how we normally talk today, or last night when we were finished.. we aren’t play flirting or anything like that, he’s acting weird so i’m kind of following in suit and not saying what i really want to say. He’s the type that wants to talk in person about shit and not deal with it over text. But that’s a bit difficult with quarantine and everything. We haven’t seen each other in person since the beginning of march.

To be clear, I know I probably fucked up. I can only see this going into a relationship or nothing, because I can’t be friends with benefits - i already caught feels cause i’m just a stupid fucking virgin ugh. :( does anyone have any advice for me..? What should i do? I know i’m a dumb bitch but im freaking out that i’m gonna lose him. :("
"FWB Issue Yikes. I’ve gotten myself (20F) into some ish.. 
I met this guy (28M) while I was out with my dog months ago, we added each other on instagram, chatted for maybe 2 days then we stopped. Fast forward 4 or so months (end of feb, beg March), and we started talking again. We hung out at a starbucks, got to know each other a little better, that was that. Then we hung out one or two more times before eventually hooking up. 

I made it very clear that I am not looking for anything serious, I wanted this to be a casual thing. He understood and said we should just see where it goes.

Fast forward a lil bit, we’ve been talking on the phone often, becoming good friends. We have slept together and agreed to have a friends with benefits situation (i know, i KNOW). He will often bring up how he needs to be the only one, doesn’t wanna know what I do with friends, then insists I tell him what I’m doing with friends.. We’ve got a different way of thinking and going about certain things I’ve learned. I’m sure the age difference plays a bit of a role in this. It definitely feels like I have gotten myself into a relationship rather than a touchy friendship. He’s even started telling me that he loves me. I have tried my best to be completely honest and transparent with him about what I am and am not looking for. I do care about him but he just refuses to accept where I am coming from, and it has turned me off from any future hookups with him. My gut is finally insisting that I should put an end to things, but I just don’t know how. Over the last 2 months we’ve become good close friends (especially because of this quarantine stuff going on/being unable to make plans with other people), we hooked up the other day after drinking a little, and some things were said and done that have really had me thinking about this and how I have gotten myself into a situation that I don’t want to be in.

I feel bad ending things so so abruptly especially after having sex and sharing some laughs only 2 days ago. But I also don’t want to be stringing him along. I know that we are on different pages with all this, and after trying to get us on the same page or better understanding, I just don’t think it’s gonna happen. I am also scared to do this because he is pretty firm in his ways. I have tried once or twice now saying I don’t think that this is a good idea/tried ending things, and he persuades me to just go with the flow and that we’re totally fine. I have a hard time telling people no unfortunately, but I am genuinely unhappy. Any advice would help.

I hope I didn’t ramble too much or make this confusing. Thank you in advance!"
"How do you get over your ex? My ex and I broke up three months ago and I found out that she cheated on me with two of my friends a month ago, one of whom is who she dumped me to get with. I’d just started to move on from her when I found out. Now I’m back at square one even after two months. 

I’m getting really bored thinking about what we were together and all my fondest memories of our three years together. I’m fed up of pining over a relationship that’s never going to be fixed. I’m fed up of crying and feeling crappy over a relationship that’s dead. 

I can’t wait any longer to get over her. It’s really annoying and I just want to forget about it all. How can I help myself to move on faster? I know this’ll take time but it’s been a month, but it feels like it’s been an eternity in lockdown"
"Do you tell your romantic partner about what’s wrong or do you not? I’m the second type - I usually don’t tell them about what’s wrong unless it’s very serious - and when I reach my breaking point I break up with him.
I feel like I tell him every little thing that’s going wrong with our relationship, he’ll get sick and tired of me, and the relationship.
These days, I’m trying to find the zone in the middle, but struggling.
What about you guys? Any advice on this?"
Me (M19) need help understanding this situation with my girlfriend (F19) I over think a lot of things throughout this relationship and we have been seeing each other for almost 5 months now and I just keep thinking about her ex that she was with for three years. She says she doesn’t text him but I recently caught him texting her and her texting him back. She changed her name from a guys name to a girls name and it. I don’t know if I’m just a guy to get over her break up from November. That last thing I want todo is hurt her but I feel like she is lying and I want to confront her but not start a big spiral argument. Any tips to confront her and get down to the bottom of this
"My best friend[35f] kicked out her husband[40m] and child[3m] and doesn't want to pursue a divorce or custody. I have been best friends with her for 15 years and they've been married almost 12 years. I don't know what to say to her. Honestly the whole situation makes it seem like they are acting like their toddler. I am [33f] and single for reference.

She is living in her grandpa's house with her cousin and kicked them out at the beginning of April. Her husband is staying with his parents and just found a new job there.

She seems blissfully happy now that she's able to do everything she wants without them, which is mainly watching tv and playing video games. Supposedly she has a new job coming but won't tell me anything about it. The only other thing she talks to me about is how much she hates him, how she thinks she's a terrible mother, and shouldn't be around the kid.

She's the type of person that is everything doesn't go the way she planned her day is ruined. For example, she tried to go to the DMV today but it was closed because only a few are open and some are only open by appointment. I had to help her with five minutes of searching because she couldn't be fucked to do it herself. Another example is that she never let her husband clean anything around the house because he shouldn't do it her way but would turn around and complain about having to do everything herself. I dont know how to show her that this behavior isn't healthy.

Her husband has called me twice so far. The first time was before they separated. He was drunk and kept asking me how to make her love him again. The second time was yesterday, explaining that he didn't prevent her from seeing the kid (she told me he did) and how the kid reacted to her over the phone. The kid has a lot of problems focusing but obviously I didn't see what happened.

I'm really worried about him pursuing some legal avenue at some point, and her regretting all this when the kid is old enough to understand and contact her. Plus all the risk with Covid-19. She can't see how crazy she's acting. There are a lot more examples but these are just the recent ones."
"Fake screen shot of messages likelihood? My (20F) boyfriend’s (25M) ex has been a problem for us (they have a kid together). Every few months or so she will text me w/ a random number (bc I blocked hers) saying that my BF is still with her and that he’s been cheating me. She sends me screenshots of their “texts,” saying things like he wants to work it out with her and that he hasn’t been seeing me and doesn’t want to. He always says these are fake, he even said when they dated in high school that she used to fake texts to send to his friends. 


She’s been doing this for about a year now. Just need some advice about if you think they’re fake or if my BF is lying. Feel free to ask anymore questions."
"My ex doesn’t accept the break up and I don’t know what else I can do In the begging of March, I ( F20) broke up with him (M24) after a 5 month relationship. Things were not working out anymore for me so I tried to end things on a good note. I told him to stay as just friends since we have many mutual friends and play D&amp;D together. Since our break up, he has been trying to make things go back to how it used to and I don’t know anymore what to say. I don’t want to be rude, but he doesn’t understand that I don’t want to date him anymore. My last resource is telling him that I don’t love him and that’s why we should stay as friends, but I think this, considering that I was his first girlfriend, would be too hard on him. What should I do?"
"Feeling real distant (19M) So my girl (19F) we were super close. Every day she used to text me , we used to phone call from morning till night. We’ve just hung out twice and after I asked her out the pandemic showed up lol 

This calling everyday sending memes used to happen before she moved back to her college place , now after that she barely even calls me 
And on insta the everyday text thing is now nothing not even memes and when I call her she doesn’t put up any conversation and we just sit in silence then I would say I’m going to do something she would be like okay bye the thing is I got so used to talking to her all day I can’t go one day without hearing her voice 

Also she never put a label on our relationship I think she is the one for me but it scares me that she will leave , what should I do I’ve been talking to her for almost 4 months and the behavior she is showing sounds to me she is getting uninterested"
"Feeling humiliated in a Relationships  I felt humiliated in this relationship and I don’t know what to do. Sometimes people would slip and say or do mean things but this time in front of others had brought me down to a low point. I don’t know what to do. It has left me feeling lost and confused. They said it was an accident but I don’t know if it’s my pride or normal for me to feel in such way but I’m hurt. I feel left alone and I can’t take what they say or feel about me into reality because I know I’m better than that. I’m feeling lost, can anyone give me some advice?"
"For people who have gone through a lot of heartache in romantic relationships, how did you move on completely and does it ever get better? In the middle of 2019, my former SO of 2 years at the time who I also considered to be my bestfriend broke up with me after college graduation and it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to move on from. A few months after bleeding into 2020, I got involved in a string of mostly sexual relationships with guys who ended up already being in relationships so I had to abruptly cut them off immediately after finding out even if I was starting to have feelings for them :(  Its sad to look back on these failed relationships and makes it difficult for me to open my heart up now to people who are interested. For people who have experienced a lot of heartbreaks, how did you learn to heal and trust again and were you able to find the right person for you?"
"Why would someone pull away after expressing their feelings and fears to you? I’m 25 and my post history has pretty much the entire story in it about this guy I’m talking to. 

He was cheated on by both exes but met me unexpectedly and we started talking. Things progressed slowly but really nicely up until a few weeks ago when he kissed me. He freaked out after and went quiet in the following few days. We talked about it and he felt like it was too soon. I said ok. 

We hungout a few more times, and then He began acting weird again. Finally he FaceTimed me the other night and said his best friend had asked about me and how I was and he said he wasn’t sure, he hadn’t talked to me much recently. She asked him why? 


So he told me he liked me, a lot. He wants a relationship, he wants it with me. Hes just not sure how to escape his own thoughts about his past breakups. What if I leave too? He doesn’t understand what I see in him, why I like him. He told his friend this too and she said that the fact that I’m still around means I’m interested and he needs to take it slow.  He said he was acting weird because he felt awkward after our kiss because he rushed himself into it and it was too soon, but he didn’t know how to properly express that to me, and was afraid I would leave.  

Our conversation felt like it actually cleared some things up. I felt good. And the next day we FaceTimed and he told me he wanted to hangout. He also told me he wanted me to meet another one of his best friends. 

But when I texted him yesterday to ask if he still wanted to get together, I got no answer. All I got all day were a few snapchats and he sent me a post on Instagram. 

As usual I’m leaving it alone, giving him space. But I’m afraid HE will run from me. Why would someone express themselves and then pull away again? I was calm and understanding and told him I felt the same way about him. 

Anyone else experience this?"
"Is it wrong/weird to date my brothers ex-girlfriend? Not my main account for obvious reasons lol.

tl;dr pretty much what the title says. It may be kind of an odd question, but I'm dead serious and would like sensible answers/advice only. I (late 20s) have mixed feelings about approaching my brother's ex-girlfriend (both very early 20s). It kind of feels like a bad move, or at least a bit weird/odd.

There's me, my younger brother, his ex-girlfriend. Then also her parents and her brother. I'll refer to my brother as (B) and her brother as (B2) to avoid any confusion.

Maybe a bit of background will help.

Many years ago I met an amazing and very kind family. I got along particularly well with them and even considered them as my 2nd family. B2 had a troubled past and started mixed with the wrong people (the kind that would get you in trouble with the law)... I was one of few people who stuck by him no matter what bad choices he made. I tried to encourage him to get on the right track again, but never pushed him, and was always around to hang out with him. They lived near my work/college and it reached a point I was spending more time with them than my own family. I was mostly hanging out with B2, and wasn't interested in her at the time, besides she was waaaaaay to young (do the maths). Then I started noticing that ""maybe"" she started liking me, that didn't seem too far fetched as I was seeing them multiple times a week. I also got along really well with her parents and they occasionally said a few remarks that indicated maybe they thought I was interested in her and they were ok with that (random comments like ""you're so kind"", ""you'll make a good husband"", ""I hope you find the perfect wife"" among other things) but looking back that could have been entirely innocent remarks of encouragement/support. However at that point I panicked, she was way too young, so I noped right out of that situation. I still regularly caught up with B2 and would still hang out with him but intentionally had less contact with the family.

Fast forward a few years, she's older now. I started thinking maybe I mis-read the situation and overreacted in mostly dropping them as a family. I still saw them occasionally and started thinking maybe I do like her, and that I should ask her out on a date. But decided against it, give it another year or two, she's still young. I did that knowing I risked missing my chance.

But maybe I shouldn't have taken that risk, because at about that same time B ends up getting a head start on dating her. I was slightly disappointed, but can honestly say I didn't mind. I was happy for them and wanted the best for both of them. However he decided to dump her out of the blue after a few short months of their relationship. He did this before it got too serious and before they were openly dating publicly, but people were still noticing and thinking they would soon take it more seriously. He was the one who dumped her, there were a few reasons he gave, but none of them her fault things like he couldn't get along with her parents etc. Of course that's his choice, but I think he maybe could have handled it better and treated her better in the process. Anyway I supported him as best I could, even encouraging him to think carefully about whether he's making the right choice and whether he was too hasty dumping her, and that he shouldn't worry about her parents. But 6 months on since the dumping it seems unlikely they will get back together, as they completely ignore each other. Also he already likes someone else and wants to date her instead (I suspect that may be why he dumped her in the first place, but he gave other reasons). But he  is hesitating dating this other person because it may be too soon and make him look bad. He can't really make up his mind about what or who he wants, and even thinking about moving cities to get away from it all. Although unlikely, if he does get back with her it will be mostly out of guilt for dumping her in the first place, or as a second choice if he get's rejected by the person he currently likes. No I'm not impressed with how he's handling things but gave him the benefit of the doubt that he's young and still figuring things out.

So you see it's very complicated. I'm trying to decide whether it's ok to ask her out now. But my question is, is it even appropriate? If it's fine, is 6 months after my brother was dating her too soon? Should I wait until he moves on completely and starts dating this other person he's interested in? What would other people think of the whole thing? It just seems a bit awkward, but I want to maybe give it a shot."
"Am I just crazy or do I am sorry ahead of time for a severely long post: Throwaway account due to keeping this anonymous, and giving me the options to share details I wouldn't otherwise. I also apologize if my formatting isn't reddit appropriate. 

The past year has been a really rough one.

Bit of background here. I (29f) grew up in a single parent household most of my childhood. My dad raised myself and two younger sisters from 11 on. My mother was never really present, and dissapeared from the time my parents split to the day of high school graduation, more on that later. My Dad was incredibly controlling, I grew up in a private school, rarely went anywhere aside from church, and floated between my dad, his girlfriend,  and grandparents houses randomly and unpredictably based on the story that my mom had started dating a coke dealer who threatened our lives. My dad resorted to physical violence when I inevitably broke down from all of the trauma, so I secretly got a job as soon as I could, and moved out one week after high school, after our final physical altercation. At 16, I started dating a 19 year old guy from our church. He started sexually assaulting me at 17. It was a very confusing thing to love someone that is doing that to you. I'll spare details, but it took years for me to fully process what happened to me. I already know this is a lot of information, but it does play into the rest of my story. 

Fast forward to just over a year ago. I'd been dating the same guy for 7 years, moved cities, found my dream jobs. Aside from the inconvenience in living in the same city as my mom, life's going great. 

My boyfriend had gotten an offer to take two unpaid artists residency, one for 6 weeks (costing $4,000) and another for two weeks, over the summer. I pick up some extra work to help save up and give us a cushion for the single income I'll be taking on myself for two months. Not a huge problem, I tend to be a workaholic anyway and had really been juggling three jobs as it was. Both he and I work in different trades, not incredibly well paying, but we get by. He had also been wanting to do the tiny living thing for years, to save money for a house. With our incomes and the city we live in, it's almost impossible to save a lot while paying rent. I agreed and we bought a used travel trailer, he borrowed money from his Dad. His friend agrees to let us live in his tiny house for a small amount of rent while we fix it up. 

The deadlines start coming up and he decides to use up the last of some savings bonds he has to do the residency, since we hadn't saved much at that point, (even with me working 60 hours weeks plus) and he owed a good amount of money on taxes. not my money and not my business, I figure, though I am very stressed and a little preterbed because the whole point of living ""tiny"" is to save money. I'll admit here my first mistake was not saying something at this point. Starting in March a wave of bad luck hits me. Work injury, a friend dying in a car crash, and finally in May my Mom gets diagnosed with stage 3 breast Cancer. Even though we aren't particularly close, I'm the only one of my sisters who really speak to her, and I live in the same city, so I'm handling the brunt of this experience with my stepdad. On top of my crazy schedule, I'm taking her to appointments, dealing with her meltdowns, and phoning information to my family who prefers to not contact her directly. I maintain the work schedule, but start drinking excessively in my free time as a way to blow off steam. I've used this in the past as a way to deal with my trauma and anxiety. I know it's not good. My boyfriend claims this is our sole issue. 

So he's ready to leave for 6 weeks, and asks me if I'm going to be okay. I say yes, something in my is proud and in denial. I also secretly think that if I successfully pull this off, maybe marriage will be on the counter. All stupid decisions. We have no savings, a gutted travel trailer, have to move out of our apartment a few days after he gets back, with nothing packed or sorted through before he left. I broke down two weeks in when my boss casually asks if I'm going to be able to manage all this. (Mind you just tearing up, still very proud) I drink but just at home because of the tight budget. He calls and he hates the residency, thinks he's getting ripped off, but wants to stay. I express at this point I'm overwhelmed, but he really believes it's good for his resume, and tells me to just not worry about the trailer or moving and just focus on work. Growing dread every day, admittedly drinking when I could do even a small thing here or there, but all I could see was the giant pile of things I had to do and could do nothing. I confide in a friend that I am very upset with him and thinking of ending it over this, she tells me to hold out because she heard he secretly bought a ring. 

Here's where I'm really an idiot. He returns from the first trip, stays a week, just enough time to move and sell everything that I hadn't handled yet, and our anniversary happened to land in that week. I'm almost confident a proposal was going to happen then( now I know it was true)  but he backed out. I sort of selfishly tell him I want him to stay. Very subtly, because I know the guy he's going to learn from is a huge deal in his trade, and it's a guys trip too with all his coworkers and buddies going too. Money is still tight, but he chooses to go and tells me to hang on just two more weeks. We fight on the phone when we can talk, he doesnt have great service where he is. 

He returns and we argue a lot over this experience. I hate living in the tiny house and the trailer still isn't getting anywhere. I'm honestly burnt out and hate even looking at the trailer. So I'm still working at the same pace, but he asks me to let him handle the trailer and take time for myself. His work schedule is hit or miss, he says since he is the boss he feels he should prioritize giving hours to the workers over himself, and takes time off for the trailer. 

My stress is definitely taking over. We get in a big fight over the summer situation again, i get blackout drunk and the next morning he stops speaking to me for a week. he tells me on his birthday he doesn't know if he wants to do this anymore, I guess he had called his mom and she wanted to fly him home for his birthday so we could ""put some distance between us"".  He doesnt want our two cats or the car and (car payment) because they weren't his original  idea. I'm furious. I tell him I need time because I dont have a savings at this point and cant find an apartment just like that. I almost was okay, but panicked at the thought of living in my car or at a friend's if that was possible. My moms is an option but again complicated. She was part of our arguement. We talk it out and I agree to go to therapy to work out my drinking and built up trauma and when we can afford couples therapy, we will do that.

I do better for a couple months. Still very busy schedule, but things are looking up for my mom, I'm getting better at responsibly distancing myself from her life. On my birthday dinner in November he gets really nervous again, I prod at the end of the night and he proposes. I'll admit this felt half hearted and just didnt sit right after thinking two months before we were talking about splitting up. I ignore it thinking that this could be the good thing we needed. 

Since the proposal he has contributed very little to the engagement process or even considering a wedding. We do finally agree to put it off til 2021, and agree on doing it in Puerto Rico since his family lives there and we both love it. We had friends who wanted to throw us an engagement party, but it got cancelled in March Due to the COVID-19 situation. Even with the date approaching, the most help I got from him was who he wanted to invite, so I was sort of grateful when it ended.

He takes on another artist residency for the beginning of March ( I am a complete idiot, I know) this time for a stipend and we can move our trailer on site (still not even close to done.) Before this happens, I tell him I want separate bank accounts from now on, agree to help him while he's on a stipend. and the engagement is on hold. Then coronavirus hits. He was already out of work, and I lose 75 percent of my income. I had just gotten two promotions in january. Since our trailer isn't finished and the communal restrooms, kitchens, and showers on his worksite are out of the question, his friend graciously let's us move back into the tiny house. 

I've been going absolutely crazy for the past year, and this was just the icing on top of the cake. All this being said, I truly love the guy, and the past year was something I never thought I would see from him. He has good traits, things I truly love, but I do feel abandoned and used at this point. My problem is I cant tell if it is my mental health and drinking that is blinding me from my problems in the relationship. Maybe he only did this because I'm not pleasant to be with? I carry too much baggage? Maybe it's being isolated to one room with another person that's pushing me over the edge. Theres so much negativity in that space from the past and I cant get over it. He argues I need to do more things for myself, but I feel like I cant trust him to handle the rest, especially financially. What are my next moves here? Do I wait it out til we fix the trailer, or til the virus situation gets better? Would a change of space help this?

Again, sorry for the long post, any advice would be highly appreciated."
"I (28F) hate my husband’s (30M) beard and do not know what, if anything, to do about it. I (28F) have found out the hard way that I do not like the look or feel of a beard on a romantic partner. 

My husband (30M) was clean-shaven for most of the almost six years we have been together. He decided to start going a beard last fall. I was supportive and got him a fancy beard oil for Christmas and such. 

The beard has taken some work. He is not one of those guys who can just not shave for three weeks and have an even, thick beard; his beard looks respectable now, but it took months of growth to get to that point. This beard is by all objective standards tidy, well-conditioned, and well-maintained. My husband is doing the beard thing right. He is proud of it and has expressed that he would like to keep it. His brother also grew a beard during the same time period, and his fiancée is “making him” shave the beard. My husband has spoken negatively of this development. 

My problem is that I just hate the beard. I am kissing him less because I feel like I always end up with a mouthful of hair. I feel less attracted because I don’t like the way it looks. I get grossed out because he now loudly slurps foods I did not know could be slurped to avoid getting food in his beard. It smells a little musty sometimes. I am just all around not a fan. 

So I am conflicted. It is entirely his right to grow this beard and really I ought to have no say—it’s his face. But I’d also like to want sex and it’s not fair to limit kisses to delicate pecks. 

TL;DR: My husband grew a beard and I am struggling with balancing my hatred for it with his bodily autonomy."
"My [18F] crush [18M] called me a bitch and asked me to fuck off! And now he thinks I'm overacting. Because he was just joking. According to him, he was joking and I'm just overacting in this situation. We both were joking about something and then he suddenly came out and said, ""Fuck off! You poor lady"". I was like, ""take that back. You can't talk to me like that."" He completely ignored it and replied with ""fuck off means fuck off!"" ""Fuck off ! You bitch""

I was mad and kind of hurt at this point. I told him, how he could not talk to me like that and wrote a big message about him being disappointing and rude.  Then suddenly he got all serious was like, "" he was just joking and I'm overreacting."" He apologized about it. And I was okay with it. 

But did I do the right thing? Or did I really overact?"
"My significant other [25F] is more materialistic than I am. It feels overwhelming. How do I [27M] handle this? TL;DR: Moved from a 2 bedroom apartment where it was difficult to fit all of our stuff, to a four bedroom home and we keep getting more stuff. She is taking lots of stuff from her parents, lots of furniture, and I feel so overwhelmed like I have no choice. feels like she doesn't respect me when I say that I'm not comfortable taking on so much stuff, or that I'm concerned about the cost of moving all this stuff. 




my girlfriend and I have been together for about 2 years now. we previously lived in a two-bedroom apartment for the two of us, where we had the office as the second bedroom, and that was filled with a bookcase that has so much stuff on it, two desks in the office, computer stuff, there's a TV stand that has storage totes under it. It was challenging to fit all of our stuff in the apartment and it felt very cluttered and overwhelming. We recently moved into a four-bedroom home and intend to fill all four bedrooms with furniture. it already feels like our home is cluttered because we have so much stuff from our apartment, and we keep getting more stuff from her parents. We are also housing stuff for her sister who lives with her parents. so we have so much stuff in our home, and we just keep getting more, and I've pushed back on taking more stuff because I don't feel comfortable with it. I just don't want more bookcases and bookshelves, and armoires, and furniture to keep all these glass ornaments and art pieces on. 



On a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is a hoarder and one is bare minimalist, I'd say I'm like a 4 out of 10.... It really just stresses me out so much to think of taking on so much stuff because it feels like a weight that's going to drag us down in our future. I think we will end up living where we do for maybe three more years, and then maybe decide to move out of state. But if we did that, having too much furniture would cost a ridiculous amount of money to move. all of this furniture, these glass ornaments, this artwork, chairs, dinner tables, all this stuff that we have. I know that it's going to cost money to have it wrapped packed moved onto a moving truck by movers. It's going to cost a lot already if we ever move to have all this stuff. it seems like my significant other is fine with this. but I've been pushing back against getting all this furniture because it's just so stressful. But she tells me occasionally that I'm giving her a hard time and it's kind of like she doesn't respect what I have to say . Like if it makes me uncomfortable to have all this stuff and to continue getting more and more stuff, and I make that apparent to her that it makes me uncomfortable to keep getting all this stuff in our shared home, like why doesn't she pick and choose? Like compromise, you know? Instead it's kind of like no matter what I'm uncomfortable with, we end up having to do it anyway because it's what she wants to do. 



I'm just not sure how to handle this situation or what I should say or do"
"My (34M) wife (35F) is not taking this pandemic seriously So I'm an essential worker and my wife is on maternity leave with our second son. Her mother has smoked for 50+ years and was just diagnosed with lung cancer. Now for  context I've been there, my mother passed away from cancer 15 years ago and I took care of her for 6 years while it ate her alive. My Mil lives in the biggest city in our country but only 2 hours away from us. When the Mil was admitted to the hospital a month ago I took leave from work for 2 days to watch the kids while my wife went to take care of her mom. She ended up just hanging out with her at her house her mom still doing her normal routine. Ever since, my wife's been wanting to take her to Dr consolations and other times just to go hang out with her mom. Her mom had her license suspended due to some medications she is on but she doesn't care and still drives around (real smart). My wife and I are also military and we have been ordered to not leave the area without permission from our CO, which we can get if there's an emergency. But my wife is just planning on not telling her chain of command. We've had countless arguments that there's a stay at home order and to not travel unless for emergencies as it puts ourselves and our children at risk or that we could give it to her mother who has a very compromised immune system. I've offered for her mother to stay with us and we can take care of her and take her to the hospital here to get her treatments but was declined. I've offered for us to pay for ubers to her Dr's apt also declined. Last weekend she mentioned she wanted to visit and can't wait to have her moms home cooked meal no medical reasons at all. Now this is not a nice woman. I've never met someone that dislikes me. I'm a thoughtful nice guy but the Mil straight up hated me from day one because I'm white. Growing up she left my wife countless times (at age 7) alone to get shit faced (still is an alcoholic). My wife had scholarships and sponcers for sporting events and school, her mother took the money and spent it on alcohol and who knows what else. The women has bad mouthed myself and my family when we are nothing but kind and welcoming to her. There has been times my wife has told me her life would be better if here mom was dead. But I digress, my wife wants to go hangout with her mother or take her to consolations instead of taking an uber or doing a video conference. If anyone has advice on how to convince my wife to take this lockdown more seriously I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks"
"I poured my heart on this. Sorry. Please bear with me. My bestfriend (18M) for almost 1 year has courting me for atleast 5 months now. In the duration of our friendship, I (18F) was the one who catch feelings first but he does not know it and it really left me flustered but at the same time happy when he finally confess to me that he likes me and at the moment he claims that he did not like me but its love. You see, we all people got issues either was I excempted by that fact. I've got some healing issues like insecurities, feeling numb and empty. I've also got trust issues and being anxious what other people are talking about me at my back. It was all planted back in the past where people just take me for granted and betray me and I just let them do it thinking if I was to gave love they will love me too and see that I was always by their side through thick and thin. Now, he understand that but I just cant feel that he really understand me. Even little things are big deal for me and I inform him before he started courting me that Im the real hella shit so think thrice before entering. He has broke his promise not to break my heart for I dont know times just for the reason that he did not sleep when he said goodnight and say other things other than the truth to make me less worry about him when he is outside. I forgave him. But at this moment in quarantine, I became an emotional cookie. And I have no family to hold on to and I know my two best friends got another fight too and I dont want to add up and let them know that what our current situation of my suitor. He keeps on saying things, promising things that keeps my hopes up then letting me down afterwards. I was full of disappointment for him but at first I know I always feel like he would fail everything but genuinely I believe him to succeed but now I dont know anymore. I am running cold towards him. I guess its the output of my almost every night heart hurts and I want to cry at him but he dont know what to do. He dont know what the right words to say to me to feel me better. He says its his first time and he is trying his best to do things. He feels pressured too. I want to understand him. I really do. But for the span months of our friendship and other months of being my suitor, I was really the one who were there for him. When he is sad, angry or just plain empty. I was there. Trying to comfort him. And I succeed. But now that, I am the one who needs that, he dont know it. Im getting frustrated and irritated. I was planning to say yes to him but now I was left thinking if he was worthy to be with me when he cant provide the things I need. I just want to feel the support, love and security from him like he was all I need and we are poor believe me. I dont want his money. My partner, my bestfriend and also my brother. I want him to take that roles in my life because I really like him. But I dont know anymore. I dont know what to say if he would ask me again if I like him. In 5 months of being my suitor, I dont know how many times I've lowkey push him away. Testing him if he is really serious about me. He stayed. My problem here is I dont know what to do anymore. He keeps on hurting me by disappointing me. Saying things he would do but failed to do. Its getting hard at my end to trust things. Seems like I cant depend on him.  I really dont know what to feel either at the moment. Should I let go of him or give him more chances again? This hurts me both but it is more painful if I let go of him. What do you think I should do?"
"I caught my gf for 11 years having phone sex A little background 

I have always been suspicious of people I think they are going to do me wrong on top of having depression and anxiety I can be a wreck I’ve been taking medicine to help but it’s affecting me emotionally and I’m really sensitive 

She has depression and anxiety as well but she’s been a mess longer than I have but I wasn’t put off by that I thought she was an awesome person I’ve been with her and her mood changes for 11 years and lately I have had mood changes similar but for a month 

During this month she’s developed a new level of confidence and I was like awesome your finally starting to feel good about yourself 
But I was also suspicious she’d been wanting me to leave more when weekends were our thing now she wants me gone after 24 hr

I’m in a mental state where I needed someone to tell me things are ok and she was trying to push me away when I needed her most (I’ve never felt like this before)

So today I get dressed to leave and we get into an argument about how she needs space and I need to be with her and I storm out to Walmart to buy some things but I realize I forgot my meds at her place

I walk upstairs unlocked the door and immediately hear her moaning I thought she was just watching porn until I herd her talk the the person I listened for a second and knocked on the door she said go away I said “who are you talking to?” She told me to leave you already know what’s going on I opened the door to find her naked with a choker on and two dildos next to her 

I was mortified I never thought after 11 years she would do this to me I asked her why and she said I was controlling her and scaring her lately I said you know I’m on medication that’s messing with me all the while she’s smiling 

I told her to keep everything that’s mine here I’m not coming back for it 


If there is anyone who can help me please give me some advice I’ve never experienced so much pain in my life I don’t usually ask for help and I damn sure hate drawing attention to myself but I have nowhere els to turn"
"Me (F22) and my bf (M21) moved in together and he started being really toxic and aggressive So, firstly, we've been dating for 5 years (since high school) and he acts so weirdly and aggressive towards me... Maybe it's just stress or am I missing out on something? (sorry for grammar and spelling mistakes, English is not my first language)

I even listed out shit he did since we moved in together (a month ago):

1. He got rid of my cats because he simply doesn't like cats. No, he does not have an allergy or anything, he's just ""not a cat person"". I loved my cats and I've had at least 20 of them since childhood. I was left with 3 of them and he made me give them all away. I said that I understood and that we can get other pets if we decide to. Although I was really upset about that, I respected his opinion and agreed.
2. He gets mad on me on literally the dumbest shit ever. One time, like a week ago or something, I was watching Spongebob. It just reminds me of my childhood and it was on TV at the time so I sat down and watched it. When he found out he screamed at me for being childish and liking ""baby stuff"".
3. He went through my phone because he decided that ""I was acting weird and hiding it"" even tho I did not even think about hiding it. I just put it down when I talk to him because I basically want to see him when I talk to him and he considered that ""hiding it"". He ended up screaming at me bcs he found some dude sending me dick pics. He even hit me a little bit when we argued. Turns out that was a message request in messenger and I didn't even have seen it yet. I blocked the guy after. 
4. I posted a pic of me and him on my private snapchat story that only like 3 of my closest friends see and he again blew up on me that ""I was invading his privacy"" and made me delete it. Not that pic but snapchat in general. I am not allowed to use snapchat anymore.
5. This thing was today. He literally threw an empty bottle at me because I was standing in front of the TV. I came to him to tell him that his mother called to tell that someone from his family DIED and I stood there because I couldn't get his attention in any other way. This time he went too far and I threatened to leave him if he keeps up on physically hurting me and we got into so intense argument that I started crying and locked myself in a room because it was getting too intense and he still shouted at me through the door. Then he drove somewhere. He is still not back. I have no idea where he went. He always drives somewhere when we get into an argument this intense.

So my question is.. Should I leave him? Or should I try to talk it out with him? I'm so fucking confused rn. He was always really sweet and understanding. Idk what happened to him... Help me, strangers!"
"I [28/F] lost my business due to COVID and now my relationship with my (insane) mother is teetering on the brink of being permanently terminated. Also, I got pregnant with my boyfriend of 8 months and I'm freaking out. So, to make a long and boring story short: I lost my business due to COVID. I had launched it in November and by April we knew we were over. It was a mess. To try and salvage the business, I left my apartment and moved in with my boyfriend (of 6 months at the time). He \[27/M\] graduated medical school last summer and was pressed into medical study as he had first been an RN and could operate equipment. He is often gone 24 hours a time and can come back and fall asleep in his dinner. I've been helping him with cooking/cleaning and the time we do have together we basically make a bed on the pull-out sofa and watch endless hours of TV/Movies punctuated with jogs/walks to get exercise. In addition to that, I've been dealing with my (insane) mother who didn't like I moved in with the BF and who didn't like that I was cooking/cleaning. She's a (failed) academic and believes we should all live on our own. She calls and we fight for half an hour, I hang up, she texts me angrily and we don't talk for a week. It's super unhealthy. 

Last couple of days I've been trying to salvage my business, but it's pretty much not going to happen. We' were robbed and the police are taking forever. The landlord can't cut our rent, so we need to find a new place. The co owners are upset and  we're fighting with our insurance company, so we've just been messed up. 

I had felt really blah the last couple of weeks and missed my period. That's not all that uncommon for me, so I figured it was stress. Then as another period was approaching, I just felt crappy and felt panicky, so I took a test and low-and-behold, I'm with child. Frig. 

Our health care system wasn't great to begin with and since COVID, there's a ton of new/exacerbated problems. My BF is basically destroyed when he comes home. He looks like he's run a marathon and is so tired he literally fell asleep in his dinner. I have NO idea what to say to him. This feels like ""the wrong time"" but I can't not say anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

My business failed. My mother is driving me insane and now I am pregnant and can't even visit with my family doctor because I don't have one. The person I consulted on my health is my boyfriend. We have a rarity - he doesn't work/isn't on call all this weekend. He comes home tonight and is off until Monday. This is rare and I know I'm going to have to tell him, but I have no idea. 

I kind of know *how* we got pregnant (i.e. the time it happened) but I really can't believe I let it happen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any kind of experience giving people this kind of news? 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of us: We dated for six months, moved in together, and so far, it's been good. He's by far the most normal, stable, kind person I've dated. We have a great rapport and while we're getting to know one another, it hasn't been difficult. Living together is, dare I say, easy? Without drama? I'm happy, but I don't want to ruin it by getting pregnant."
"Leave or Stay? I (21F) have a hard deadline on coming to a decision because I have other really important time-sensitive things happening in my life right now and can't keep having these thoughts in the back of my head while trying to execute my goals. I need advice at this point because I'm so 50/50 and I feel like each day I wake up with a different choice. My boyfriend (25M) of almost 3 years has given me trust issues by 

1) replying to a girl's story (who he's hooked up w/) saying she's hot - (1yr in)

2) texting a girl (he's hooked up with) he had a dream about her - (1yr in)

3) agreeing to cut off all contact then replying in a group chat w/ her (he says he was being stupid and thought it was ok b/c he replied to his other friend, not her) - (3yrs in)

4) claimed he blocked her when he restricted her access on ig (3yrs in)

I could go into more detail but I don't want to fully air dirty laundry and think this gives a good enough sense of the indiscretions. I know he has not physically cheated on me and I'm fairly confident he wouldn't do that however, I consider these actions embarrassing and disrespectful. I let it go and accepted it as a mistake the first year because people are not perfect and I understand the goal behind it was an ego boost, not an attempt to cheat or take it further. I know that for a fact. However, when you agree to a term and then do this half-assed execution I see it as bullshit. Why would you ever reply to a girl who almost cost us our relationship and even risk making me distrustful again?? He says he completely accepts that it was a stupid decision, will not happen again, and he should have thought more about it. But I just think it should've never happened in the first place and see it as repeated lack of consideration for me and lack of prioritizing our relationship over not wanting to be in an uncomfortable situation where he completely cuts someone off without addressing the situation.

He stated that he had blocked her when we were discussing the situation and coming to a conclusion but I just kept getting this uneasy feeling. I later asked him where he blocked her, he said instagram however, he later said that he misspoke and actually restricted her but to him it was the same thing b/c it still cuts off all access but without making things awkward and her knowing he blocked her. Why tf do you care what she thinks is my first thought! He also later said he blocked her on text but why would he not mention that initially? He says he didn't think of it.

I genuinely love him and I know he loves me too. We could have a very bright future and are very compatible overall but I don't want to waste my time. He motivates me more than anyone else, pushes me to reach my full potential, takes care of me and overall treats me well. I wish he would put in more effort sometimes but I can't deny that he is good to me and we generally have a great relationship. I need to come to a decision b/c I can't be unfocused right now. I know it's a lot and somewhat disorganized. I hope it doesn't sound petty but my #1 thing is trust and transparency. It's not about making a mistake or bad decision, we're not perfect, but the way you deal with it and how honest you are when you are confronted is a huge deal to me. I also wish he would take initiative in suggesting solutions like couples therapy versus giving me his stance and leaving me to weigh out the options and make a decision. He claims he doesn't want to influence me emotionally b/c he wants me to make the most level headed and best decision for myself without influence.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My boyfriend has not been consistent with his story about communications w/ a girl who almost broke us up and I have trust issues. We're great in all other areas. What should I do??"
"How should I proceed with my spouse I don’t want to be too specific on here because I feel like this is easily identifiable because our problem is unique. Also, I’m on mobile so forgive the formatting. 

I am married and have children. A few years ago my spouse (calling them F) started getting paranoid that I was cheating on them. I had pulled away in the relationship due to depression and would play video games online. Not in excess, I’d say about an hour a day and usually with the kids. On this platform you can chat with people but not give away personal info or use numbers. It was mostly kids playing and I would type in things about who was “it” in the game or how to play when someone asked. My spouse was convinced I was “talking” to someone on their romantically. Again I had no idea who they were, their gender or age. I think F thought this because I had pulled away.l and had really stopped communication while being depressed.  

I added F so F could see what I was doing on there. F started logging in only to monitor me and see how often I was on. I eventually deleted F because F’s behavior felt controlling. Since then, I’ve deleted all forms of social media to appease F. I don’t really have friends anymore. I don’t talk to very many people besides a few family members.   

I’ve brought it up to F many times and telling them this behavior is controlling and abusive. I am starting to wonder if F has a personality disorder. I can’t say anything without them being suspicious of me. I have to over explain everything. Even phone calls with family. I have to explain everything talked about. If I say anything like I want to watch a new TV show, F becomes suspicious that someone has turned me onto it and I must be having a relationship with someone. I’m also concerned F is gaslighting me. 

I asked F to seek therapy over an incident during covid. F hurt our child intentionally. It’s the first time anything like this has happened. I’ve documented it. I know tensions are because of the virus so I have F the benefit of the doubt and begged F to seek therapy. F claimed they called but they were closed. 

Yesterday another incident happened (not violence, just suspicions based of my interest in a movie). I begged F to seek therapy again and we argued quietly for most of the day and tried to stay away from one another. F told me therapy isn’t going to solve anything. F finally agreed and didn’t have the number and had to look on maps on their phone to find the building to get the number. 

I assumed, after this, F never called the therapist like they claimed after the violent incident. I asked F a few times and they claimed they did. Later on, we tried talking again and F told me they did call but only talked to the therapist for a few minutes because it was a waste of time. I lost it. I started sobbing. F became suspicious because they said I was overreacting. I feel like F is gaslighting me. F keeps telling me I overreact to things and acts like I’m crazy. F even told me their paranoia was my fault and I needed to fix it. 


The main problem is, if children weren’t involved, I would already be gone. I’m worried about what a divorce would do to them. I’m also worried about F. When we talk about splitting up F says things like “think about what this will do to the kids” “I don’t want to put them through that” and tells me I am their only family (they don’t talk to their family much but probably would if I wasn’t in the picture). F came from an abusive home and I am also worried about the kids being alone around F’s family. The therapist called yesterday and to set up an appointment and F has agreed to marriage counseling. Is there a way to fix this?"
"Send him a friend request or go on Tinder? I have a crush on a guy that I have only talked to briefly once about 3 months ago. Now I want to take the first step but I don't know if I should download Tinder and hope to be matched or just send him a friend request on FB?

What do you guys think? Also, would a guy think it would be weird to get a random friend request like that out of the blue?"
"My (20F) stepsister (18F) is visiting today. We do not get along. Five years ago, my mother (50F) and her husband (51M) got married. He had three kids and my mom had two and now we’re a blended family. We can generally all get along, especially my brother and stepbrother, though we’ve had some issues in the past. However, when it comes to my stepsister, it feels like the relationship has gone past irreparable. 

There are a number of problems that have occurred over the years but it would take forever to explain them all. When it comes down to it, she’s simply mean and self-centered. I tried to be friends with her for a long time before I realized it was pointless. Basically, she blocked me on social media but pretends to be all buddy buddy in person. 

My mom is completely fine with pretending that we all get along even though she doesn’t care for my stepsister either. I, on the other hand, have a difficult time allowing people to walk all over me and then just putting on a smile. My counselor told me, when it happened, to not confront her about blocking me on social media because it gives her the attention she’s seeking by doing that, so I never had a conversation with her about it.

I just don’t really want to pretend like we’re best friends when she has blocked me on social media and said a lot of terrible things she never apologized for. However, I don’t really want to create a bunch of drama. 

So, I guess my question is— my sister arrives in four hours, how should I act around her? Just to be clear, I did not find out about this until right now, so it’s coming as a surprise. I haven’t seen her in six months. Is there a happy medium between BFFs and enemies?"
"I'm anxious about sex My (22F) sex drive is not as high as my boyfriend's (21m) but that's ok. This is my first sexual relationship so I'm not that experienced. But we have been dating for 5 months and sexually active for 3 months so I feel like I should be better at it. Most days it is good.
But 2 days ago, he just got really disengaged and outright bored when I was giving him a blowjob. He didn't say it but he was looking everywhere else and not in the moment. And this made me feel so bad. I need the intimacy and love to feel horny so when I saw him like that, all of my mood just went away and it honestly felt like a chore to get him off so I can stop doing it. It felt like I was witnessing him falling out of love with me right then and there. 
Since then I've been so anxious about sex. It's his birthday soon and I don't want this to be a problem. But I can't stop thinking about how I will just disappoint him. Or that he deserve someone better.

So uhm....how do I get over this. And as weird as this question might be how do I get better at sex?"
"My boyfriend(34M) is starting to hate me and I don't know what to do(advice) * I am a 26F.

I have an anger problem and I am struggling to cope with the loss of both of my parents. I have been a nightmare to live with, and at this point I think my boyfriend has outright given up on me. He doesn't want to spend time with me, is not kind to me anymore, and has said point blank that I ruin him and he hates his life. But he doesn't blame me directly. He says I do things that cause him unhappiness, and that we'll work it out.

But this morning he threw an absolute fit because I didn't get the laundry done and he didn't have socks. He also said he needed to actually do something with his weekend so he'd be going out ( we go on 'adventures' a lot). I asked if what we do wasn't enough and he said it's great, but he needs to dO SomETHING with his time besides that. I get needing time apart, but I think he hates me and doesn't want to do things with me anymore. He pushed me to go see friends yesterday, and when I did ( abiding by social distancing, things are different in every state so please do not judge me) he was pissed when I came home that I went out.

I don't know if I should leave him for his own good. I make him so unhappy and I hate myself more each day because I can see how far down I've dragged him into my personal hell and I want to at least put in effort to attempt to fix things but would that be more unfair to him to try? Should I cut him loose and let him go live his life without me? I think he'd be happier with literally anyone else but me.

I can elaborate or clear things up if anyone cares but I'm crying my eyes out typing this, and it's all over the place and I'm really sad so I don't know if this even makes sense or comes across the way I want it to. Hate on me if you want, I deserve it. Can't even fight it. I know I didn't explain why it's gotten to this point but it's been 3 years so like what do you want to know, hahaha..

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I made my boyfriend hate being with me."
"My [25/M] sister [27/F] will not stop sending me articles about the benefits of sleeping naked I have joint pain that get worse when I’m cold. I have circulation problems and am underweight, so I get cold very easily. My apartment is also drafty as hell. In order to avoid being in constant pain and freezing, I wear a lot of layers no matter the season or time of day. At night, I have a down comforter and a microfiber blanket + sheets, the microwavable heating pads I strap to troublesome joints, and my full flannel pajamas and socks just to be able to sleep comfortably and not have pain in the morning. During winter, I have an electric blanket and sweater.

My sister is a huge health nut who will go on these screeds about her fad du jour for weeks before finding another one. I guess her whole thing right now is sleeping naked is healthier for you? She spammed like 4 articles in a row on Facebook, which is currently the best way for me to keep track of elderly relatives right now. I made a joking comment about how I would I have to be removed from my bed with an ice pick if I slept naked.

My sister has responded by spamming me with articles over both Facebook and text message about the supposed health benefits of sleeping naked. They’re all clickbait stealing from one another, so basically I’ve been sent the same article over and over. We’re talking four to six times per day my sister is telling me to get naked. I don’t even get fully nude to have sex. I don’t want my sister to ever think about me naked or vice versa. I don’t want to block her, but I can’t get her to stop.

TL;DR: My sister won’t stop bothering me about sleeping naked, something that would absolutely result in physical pain if I did so."
"Husband [32/m] and I [27/f] play a weekly game with friends online, his over competitiveness makes me cringe and idk how to resolve this. I feel like I'm wishing for my existence to be like the Black Mirror episode where you have recorded accounts of every moment of your life.

The main hurdle for conflict resolution between my husband and I are just that we cant ever reconcile how events/convos shook out after the fact. I get that different people = different perspectives. But sometimes people can act objectively awful and it's so frustrating when others can't recognize that.

Last night we were playing a long-form game with a few friends over discord, which has been going on once a week for the past month. Part of the game is to strategize with others but every time we sit down to play, husband tries to convince the group to gang up on a specific friend. The first time was funny since noone was really engaging in that and we all laughed it off. But the next few play sessions he continued to only target this one friend, I personally was beginning to feel awkward about it. We were all kinda doing our own strategy and husband wouldn't let it go that ""friend was winning"" and we all had to gang up on him. Friend seemed to be taking it in stride but last night I got the impression my husbands behavior was starting to make the rest of the group uncomfortable. He'd make comments like ""I guess if you all wanna lose"" when the tone of the game wasnt uber competitive, but more like an excuse for us to hang out online. It just felt really patronizing when he'd constantly throughout the night say ""I dont think you all realize [friend] is winning."" when noone else even felt there was a clear winner yet. We were all kinda ready to wrap up the game anyway and move on to the next one but husband's over competitiveness imo was killing the vibe...

All that being said, once we ended and got off discord, I brought up that maybe he should tone it down and that I felt the group and myself was feeling awkward about his behavior. Now this is the point in the story where his account and my account of the convo start to differ. He claims my criticism was brought up in a nasty way, I feel like my tone was neutral and he was being defensive. I feel like his reaction was way out of line, considering right when I made that comment he starting throwing hyperboles at me like ""I guess I'll just NEVER speak again!"", ""you want to control everything i say!"", and ""I guess we just cant hang out with the same friend group together!"". I never insinuated any of these things, I just didnt want him to continue this tirade into the next game session if noone else was into it.

In his defense, i did promise in the past that if I felt awkward/upset about something he did/said, I'd put a little distance between the incident and me bringing it up. This was an effort to make sure if it was still bothering me at a later time, it was worthy of a discussion in the first place. I didnt do this and made my comments right after the game, it was fresh in my mind and I've since apologized for that aspect. At the tail end of the session his tirade felt so overt I threw not hands up and made an exasperated face like the kind you involuntarily make when you cringe at something. This is why I felt the need to address it then and there after the call.

We never were able to resolve things that night,  and now the next morning he is acting like I was the one out of line for mentioning it in the first place, saying this incident was a 10/10 for him emotionally and he's now gonna second guess every word he says around me. This isnt fair, he isnt even bothering to acknowledge that I was feeling uncomfortable with his actions during the game, hes only fixated on the way I brought it up. He doesnt recognize his extreme defensiveness during the argument and wont own it. He made the point that I'm putting words in people's mouths assuming the rest of the group felt the same (I dont claim to be an expert in reading a room, but I didnt fabricate the awkward silences/discomfort that followed every time he wanted to gang up on our friend). I said that's exactly what hes doing to me, putting words in my mouth that I want to control everything he says. I guess the advice I'm looking for is how can we be better at resolving conflicts if we cant even agree on what/how things were being said in the heat of the argument."
"Breakup during deployment.. any advice ? My boyfriend and I broke up a few days ago. We have been dating for 8 months now. He is deployed currently (for 4 months now). We both are the type of people who enjoy spending time together in person with our partner, but with this deployment it has been difficult on us. The distance has taken a toll. There’s been increased agitation on both ends and arguments that have occurred (increased to almost nightly). Nothing serious to argue about. My boyfriend said the constant arguing has taken a toll on his mental health (he is not the type of person who likes to argue). I miss him terribly. I obviously am going to give him space. He removed me off his social media and has not responded to my last message. I think he’s serious about it being over with me. Does anyone have advice?"
"I always feel unwanted/unwelcome in my group of friends, I've gone radio silent. What should I do? I'll start this off about myself, I'm (16M) not the most ""emotionally stable"" guy out there. I'm insecure about the things I do and I dwell a lot on what other people think about me, so you could say I'm sensitive.

My group of friends which I've been in and known for over 4 years has been always special to me. At first we were just 3 people who bonded over our love for Nintendo. We called ourselves ""The Nintendo Squad"" because of this. Over the years we had more people join and eventually expanded out to other things such as PC Gaming and others. I'am or used to be the ""most important"" member in the group because I had helped the first two convince their parents to get 2DS' for Christmas, bring in most of our current roster and coordinate the hacking of our systems down the line to do piracy and bring the group closer than ever. We did everything together, We ate lunch together, We played together, We hung out everytime we could. Our humor over the years too, changed and basically deteriorated to what i call ""bully-humor"". Its basically insult someone, have a laugh and shake it off because its a joke and we're all close friends. Eventually, it would go way too far.

By 2017, it was mostly tame with light jabs at each other followed by actual conversations on the latest and coolest Nintendo games because at this point we were still the little kids who worshipped Nintendo. By 2018, that would mostly maintain until towards the end of the year where the problems started to show up. We would all target this one guy in our group who had a birthmark on his forehead that made him like Aang but less arrow, more rectangle shaped. He was our Pokemon guru for his deep knowledge on the Pokemon franchise but he never owned an actual 3DS or 2DS. He was never poor but just had strict parents who wanted him to focus on his studies. He was a really nice guy who never really bit back if you roasted him which all this made him a prime target. Now I'm not saying we downright insulted him or roasted him in a cruel way, he was more of a scapegoat whenever you yourself got targeted. I give him the biggest props for putting up with this and still staying with us.

2019 rolls around, the new school year just started and suddenly I become the new prime target for the group to essentially gang up on. By this point the line of going too far had completey blurred out and they did not know when to stop. They would insult me for no reason what so ever, they wouldn't let me speak if I tried to retaliate and they would just shut me up and looking back makes me think this is where any self esteem I had left would be thrown away. 

One faithful afternoon I invited two of my friends, We will call them Harold (one of the original 3) and Anton (the 6th member i think) to play Garden Warfare 2 with me. At the time we picked up the game on sale and I really liked playing the game, It was fun and relaxing. I told them to join my lobby which had not fully ended yet (still in the Results screen) and they started to call me out on it calling me an idiot, so much so that Anton took a picture of the message telling him he could not join and sending it to me. When they did join, I was on the Zombies team and they were both on Plants so the bullying continued just because I was on the opposite team. So i unplugged my microphone because I just didnt wanna talk to them but this had not been the first time i did this, just the first time it ended badly for everyone. Harold was immediately able to tell because he can hear ringing and started bullying me even more because of it and encouraged Anton to join in.

They started chanting things like ""plug back mic n*gga Ed"" (btw we're all asians) and repeatedly called me salty. This is when something inside me snapped, why is it that I'm just trying to have fun with my friends on a game I really enjoyed are insulting me for no reason? Thats when I immediately plugged my mic in and i SCREAMED at them, asking them if they even considered my feelings on what they were doing to me all the while i can still hear Anton in the background faintly laughing. I left the game and the call, shortly after Harold tried to apologize saying that ""he feels really bad"" and ""it wont happen again"" (this also wasnt the first time he said this) I was having NONE of it so I told him to fuck off and I went to our group gc to rant on how I was being treated more as everyones punching bag and I wasnt being treated as a person. I left the gc and the group and promptly blocked Harold and Anton.

Anton and I were classmates so of course the classroom got tense because of my anger towards what he did. 

-This isnt even half of the story! Thanks for reading it this far-

Few months pass and I eventually make things up with them and I rejoin the group. The group is whole again and the bully humor has been toned down way lot. 

Fastforward to about March 2020, our quarantine starts and we're out of school. Me, Harold and Anton get excited to play Apex Legends with full freedom and no homework. This is where a cycle begins. It consists basically of Sleep, Eat, Apex. Soon a 4th guy comes to play with us but Apex Legends has a max of 3 members so we split up into 2s. This 4th guy (Lets call him James) is really good at the game because of his background on CSGO, I'm not very close with James since he was never part of the group but he is one of Harolds close friends so i do my best to be friends with him. But whenever we have to pair up he'd pick Harold or Anton so when we do get paired I do my best to play good but end up choking. I felt like such a burden to him and It always feels like he doesn't want me to join so it would be just him, Harold and Anton. 

This is where my real issues start. I stopped having fun because I felt like such a huge burden to the team and whenever we died I'd blame it on me for not doing good enough. Im not the best at the game but I have an above average winrate even when not playing with them. One day I disconnected from a DUOS game with James and I broke down, I stopped playing so those 3 could play together. This is when i suddenly disappeared and ignored all messages. I had become so reliant on my friends that I would skip eating just so I could play a few more hours with them because their time would be soon up. I felt that disappearing would let me have more me time. I came back about a week later to tell the main Nintendo group that there was a Splatoon 2 DEMO coming up and I wanted to play it with them, one of them being excited because I came back. The demo wouldnt start for a few more days though so I disappeared again.

The DEMO week starts and for only 3 of those days that a lot of us played together. In the end I was playing by myself. Whenever I'd ask if anyone wanted to play they'd just seen my message. Anton would rather play Titanfall 2 instead which I understand but him not even declining it and just leaving it on read would devastate me. To make it worse he'd message the Apex Legends gc if anyone wanted to play and they'd play like I wasnt even there not reading the messages. 

The last few hours of the demo were here and I once again, played by myself. When the DEMO actually ended I messaged the GC about it saying I had fun and that i wished we played together more to which ONE person responds with ""oof"". I felt so bad that I even came back because through out the week I'd share them things about my Animal Crossing town and they would also just read it. This was when I decided I was gonna leave indefinitely, I suddenly left with no message both Nintendo and Apex gcs. So far It has been 3 days but I plan to be gone for the whole summer. 

What do you guys think? Am I overreacting? I want any kind of feedback, I wanna go back but at the same not because I dont wanna feel like such a piece of shit anymore. What do you think I should do?

TL;DR: Everyones ignoring my messages and I feel like shit because of it."
"My [24M] long distance girlfriend [25F] of 7 years just broke things off. Should I try to save the relationship? I have been in a relationship with who I believed to be my soulmate  for almost 7 years. We met in high school and lived together for 4 years. Last year we became long distance as she moved out of state for a new career. It broke my heart. I should’ve followed, but at the time I was afraid to make the jump. I was reluctant to cut ties with my family (with whom I am extremely close) as well as leave my decent paying job. So we agreed to live apart with full intentions of me joining her when the time was right. 

Once she moved away, I moved back in with my parents. I don’t like it here because I feel it is regression. The truth is it put me into a mild depression, however I felt it necessary to save money for our future. 

Our LDR phase has been mostly fine. I’ve visited her 3 times, each for a week. They were truly the only 3 weeks in the past year where I felt alive again. 

Then the other day she broke things off over FaceTime. 

It completely blindsided me. We haven’t had a single argument. Our conversations over the past few weeks were entirely loving. Completely normal. Apparently they were lies. 

I didn’t really believe she meant it, but today she made it abundantly clear she no longer wants to be in a relationship. 

I really don’t know what I did. She says she feels “shackled” and “drained” and “needs to work on herself.” This sounds like a cover for infidelity or at least lusting for someone else. But I have no real reason to believe this is the case other than insecurity. 

When I tried to argue in favor of saving our relationship, she said I was being controlling, not letting her make her own decision. I said we can work through anything together. She wouldn’t take it. 

I do know she’s been feeling quite stressed, getting headaches and not sleeping lately. I honestly try to do everything in my power to be a supportive partner. Perhaps I am being too “clingy.” I was taught to shower your partner with love. Have I gone too far where it feels overbearing and she’s lost respect for me as a man?

She says she still loves me, she just needs to “figure out what she wants” and that this time apart “is necessary so we don’t end up divorced if we get married.” 

I couldn’t disagree more. I feel strongly that a couple should weather whatever storm they are facing together. I don’t understand why I can’t give her space without ending the relationship. 

This is the woman I want to marry, I want to be the mother of my children, who I want to grow old with. I’m ready to settle down now. I had planned on moving in with her in April until the Coronavirus outbreak. I had planned on proposing by the end of the year. I’m fearful she wants to explore the world as a single woman again. 

Needless to say I am absolutely crushed. I have no idea what to do. I have no idea where to go. My entire life – my future, has been planned around *our* lives. I don’t think in terms of *me,* only *us.* 

I haven’t truly been happy since we lived together. I feel so empty. 

How should I approach this? Let it die? Fight? Back off?"
"Often feeling guilt when talking to my mother My (28F) mom (63F) makes me feel guilty for most things she does for me.
So as long as I remember my parents were always doing things for me. Like stuff I wanted to do but they'd do it for me. Or I wasn't given chores or anything to do at home, even in my twenties (I started doing some without being asked, but it was never expected).
Now that I live on my own, I'm still very close to them. We talk at least every week, if not every other day. One thing that's been bothering me recently is the way my mom addresses me and how she tells me what to do, mostly concerning my finances. I'm not against the advice at all, it's very helpful, it just feels imposed.
Also, she is hard to talk to : any time she thinks I'm criticizing or I'm not taking her advice, her attitude changes and I feel super guilty.
The last thing they are doing for me were paying for an accountant to do my taxes with theirs, and I'm realizing this year will be the last time since she was hurt when I didn't take much time to talk to them about it as they called at a bad time. I should have said so and called them back but idk the guilt is always there and they were telling me how much money I'd save with those documents that she too the time to ask for etc...
Am I an ungrateful child? What should I do to feel better about my relationship with my mother?
I really appreciate your honest opinions, I'm very happy with my life in general and I wish I could have an adult to adult relationship with her, and I'm not sure if I'm the one being childish or she's the one treating me like a child."
How do I draw line?? I have always had boundaries issues. I can't draw a simple line. I myself feel like I invest too much but I can't bring myself to halt. How do I draw line??  How do I stop myself from hurting myself and my relationship??
"I really like this guy... But he has alot going on... I've been talking to this guy for about three weeks or so. Everything was good until I moved back to my University house to meet him. We planned to spend the weekend together but Friday night an emergency came up with his family so I only saw him for a few hours tho everything was good. It's a week on and he's been distant we used to video chat every night and I haven't got a call since I moved back and he ignores me for long periods of time. He's recently gone back to work but he ignores me when he's not working. He seems to have alot going on with his family and messages me saying he thinks he's going to bring me down and he's worried about bringing someone into his chaotic life (he's 25 with kids and I'm 20 and in University). 
I keep trying to tell him to talk to me and trust me but I think he's had alot of bad experiences with his ex. I feel like I should just give up but he seems to be a genuinely sweet guy that I really like.
Any advice is welcome, thanks :)"
"I think I'm going to be cheated on pretty soon This is my first post on reddit and I'm not aware of how things work and such but i need some advice. 

My girl and I have been together for little over 6 months perhaps and i can't help not telling her that i constantly feel as if she's slipping away.

Background: I've been in 3 relationships and all three ended with the girl cheating on me. Me finding through my friends etc wasn't as easy thing and before i wasn't the jealous type at all. I didn't mind having my girl talk to guys that i particularly didn't like. I never got jealous but being cheated on thrice and not getting closure in all the three relationships has, maybe, changed me and it's not a nice feeling. 

Now my girl has more guy friends than girls and i constantly feel alienated. I constantly think about her leaving me or getting bored of me. I don't want to lose this girl but i feel as if I've changed from what i was when we started dating. We'd always be laughing, never had a dull day, always had something to talk about or do. Now it just feels that whenever she calls me or texts me its just to fulfill a necessity, a routine if you will. We went from talking to each other all the time to just maybe a few minutes here and there in a day. I now feel that I'm not even on her go to list and that she just doesn't care. I don't want to be a formality in her life and i don't want to drive her away. A few days ago we just stopped talking and i didn't want to burden her, i thought that I'll just fade away and be there for her when she needs me but she told me that i was just being a lil dramatic and that she loves me etc. That same day i asked her if she felt congested.... she said that she does and its not just by me. I feel trapped and alone. I just don't want to drive her away.
Is me being jealous or insecure of her hanging out with her male friend 'A' wrong? Is it not my place? Am i wrong here? What should i do? I have a lot on my mind and i have a lot to say but this is just what i could type down on the spot. I'm really looking for a solution here guys.

P.s i just checked her Instagram and she's out on a walk with her friend A."
"I [19M] need to break up with my Gf [19F] but due to quarantine I cannot see her to say it in person, should I do it over text or wait? We are essentially a long distance relationship and we have been for a while because of our different schedules and us leaving for college. We have been dating for almost a year, not very long but she is still very attached due to her previous boyfriend being an asshole. I need to break up as it hurts both of us to be apart for so long and we most likely will remain apart for the forseeable future. I cannot facetime her or call her as her parents don't like her taking calls a lot of the time and I obviously cannot see her as we will both be in quarantine for the forseeable future, most likely a few more months and then we both head to different colleges again. I feel like this is a shitty thing to do but I also feel like I have to rip the proverbial band-aid off to mitigate the pain later. Is this the right thing to do? Or should I wait?"
"[M28] Unsure if the relationship will work I've been reading advice online and the bolded text on the link below seems like I wrote the question. Scarily similar to my situation.

https://www.salon.com/2006/08/11/girlfriends_family/

The only difference is that I bought a house and I asked her to move in so we could try the relationship at a new level.

We've been together for almost four years. We've argued in the past about me not wanting to go to family dinner every Sunday and now I only go occasionally. But I feel guilty, especially because other significant others go. And I still see her family every 2-3wks, every holiday and at a few family game days a year (dodgeball, egg toss, etc.). Her mom even started a ""takeout"" service for ""all of us kids"" on Sundays during the pandemic. That freaked me out from a safety perspective, so I told my GF I felt uncomfortable and she hasn't picked up food since. But now I feel like her mom is offended. I want a wife and kids and a life of my own. Not run by her mom or her family's schedule of events.

I don't think it's wrong for someone to be super close to their family, and I don't think it's wrong for someone to feel like me. My parents are 8 hours away, sister is 4 hours away, and we have a group chat that's active and call each other a few times a week. I love my family and the independence we all have.

I think I answered my question by typing this out. I think that both lifestyles are fine, and even though we love each other, we may not be compatible. I don't want to feel guilty and smothered for the rest of my life. I wondered if anyone has any additional advice?

EDIT: I originally said I don't go to Sunday dinner anymore. But updated because I do go occasionally (once or twice a month)."
"My [25F] boyfriend [30M] confessed to me he has many unpaid traffic tickets and unpaid credit card debt. Some context: my bf and I have been in a relationship for 6 months now. We’ve been friends for 4 years. We were once FWB as we were both going through dark times breaking up with our then partner about 3 years ago. I’ve always had feelings for him but nothing came out of it 3 years ago. It was the whole “right person wrong time” situation. He eventually moved away but we rekindled what we had about 6 months ago when we decided we were in a better place to be in a relationship. 

We are In a LDR. So I fly or drive up to see him and he does the same when possible. Fast forward to the last time I saw him. We decided to have a candle lit dinner at his place and that’s when he told me. He told me ha has many traffic tickets and he’s unsure how much and how many. He never showed up to court, Never paid a dime and on top of that he says he also has unpaid credit card debt. So much so that they’re often sending him collection letters. And with that his credit is poop. I appreciate his honesty so much. I valued honesty but I’m concerned about the future. We decided by the end of the year I’d move up to live with him and we’d get a place and blah blah blah. My credit is great. Above 750 and I have never missed a payment. I’ve also saved up a good sum of money for my big move; and he’s not saved so far (gets paid monthly). So as you can see we are complete opposites. A lot of what I thought could happen when I moved up may not be possible now. I’m just unsure of how to approach this in a way I can help him or help our future. I love him so much and I don’t think this changed how I feel about him but it for sure affects our future in the long run. I should also mention he doesn’t have a car...if it matters. Just wanted to vent. Thank you! 

TL;DR my boyfriend confessed he has a lot of debt and poop credit and we plan to move in together in the next year. Now our plans may change as far as where we move and our future could be a bit stressful."
"I do not know if I should break up with him or not. I have been in a very happy relationship for 3 months now, but my brother isn't okay with it a it is with one of his friends. My brother has gone as far as threatening me. My bf and I have a very special connection, hell I even think he might be the one, but then there´s the issue.

I´ve even thought about breaking up with him but I can never bring myself to do it, he´s the most supportive, kind, and understanding person I know. At the moment we are going no contact as I am trying to figure out what to do. I am in desperate need of help. What should I do?"
"I (20F) am diagnosed with BPD. My parents won't let me receive therapy, and I'm ruining my relationship with my SO (20M). Can you give me any tips on bettering myself? My SO and I are based in the Middle East, and our relationship has been going on for about 3 months.

I was diagnosed with BPD last year after secretly saving money to go to a psychiatrist for a few sessions. Sadly, the psychotherapy sessions that I needed were way too expensive for me to handle on my own. 

After I was diagnosed, I casually found an excuse to ask my parents about how they felt about borderline patients, and they responded that they thought we were just looking for an excuse to be hateful and that we were just ""evil"". Needless to say, I couldn't tell them. You can guess that my family life is pretty bleak because we just can't get along. Anyways, onto the topic at hand.

I fall in and out of love so quickly, sometimes with multiple people at once. My current relationship is the first one where I can muster the self-control to stay completely monogamous, as my SO is incredibly loving and supportive towards me. I told him about my diagnosis during our first date, and he responded that he knew about the disease and would stand at my side no matter what. He's incredibly positive and patient with me. It helps, but it doesn't stop me from treating him like absolute garbage.

I'm a terrible impulse eater and I have gained more than 15kg's over a period of 1 year as a result. I cannot lose the weight as I just cannot stop eating. This had a horrible effect on my self esteem. I always compare myself to random pretty women I see on YouTube or other places and take out my anger on my SO. I accuse him of wanting to date these women and secretly wanting to leave me, which he vehemently denies every time it comes up. As my mood is also really volatile, I usually come to my senses in the middle of these arguments and apologize profusely. He doesn't say it, but I know it's hard on him.

This isn't the only thing that we fight about. While I know that deep in my heart, I love him, my feelings towards him are incredibly ambivalent. I love him in the morning, and despise him in the afternoon for no reason at all. In these moments, I come up with the most stupid excuses to abuse him, such as him responding a minute late to a text or not using the exact words that I expect him to. 

I'm incredibly prone to self-harm. I used to be a heavy cutter, but that has since regressed to hair-pulling and clawing at my thighs. I get these intense bouts of suicidal feelings where I will go, stand over the balcony, and call my SO, so that he can convince me not to jump. I'm sure it's incredibly emotionally trying for him.

I really don't want to live like this anymore. I have a perfectly good relationship and I'd like to hold on to it. I just don't want him to feel unloved and eventually leave me. So, especially if you've received psychotherapy before, can you help me out?"
"I feel like I’m going to be alone forever. I believe I have trust issues. Because of this I don’t want to let anyone in my life but at the same time I have to much emotional baggage for anyone to let me into their life. This makes me feel like I will be lonely for life because of permanent pain from my childhood. How do I work on trust issues. How to I go about dating someone with my emotional baggage. I feel like no one wants that responsibility, but I’m also not keen on opening up to anyone in fear I will be hurt. This backwards thinking is messing with me."
"Please help.. My dad (67M) is cheating on my mom (66F) who has brain cancer and I am living a lie to protect her. TL;DR  My mom was diagnosed with brain cancer, recently.  I have found out since then that my dad is cheating on her.  I have to keep his secret for the mental health of my mom and I'm losing it.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents have been married for over 45 years and have been a model to their kids for happiness and marriage.  They have a vacation home outside of our home country (US) and my mom was staying there alone while my dad was on a business trip (it was a legitimate biz trip).  My sisters and I chat with her daily and we noticed she was acting a bit strange, almost like she was drunk.  We asked if she'd been drinking and she said no but she was just sounding REALLY off.  The sister who lives closest to her got on a plane and flew there to see wtf was going on, because something was NOT right.  Sister arrives and we're chatting this whole time and simultaneously chatting with Mom and, sister says, this is a fucking emergency, Mom has had a stroke or who the hell knows, but she needs emergency help because she's acting completely crazy.  Other sister and I are calling police station near my mom's house, military base, embassy, etc to get help because this house is in a very remote area with very little ....structure, and there are no nearby hospitals (think remote island).  Meanwhile, we are trying to get my dad to her and we're all freaking out.  

&amp;#x200B;

We are able to get her medivac'd to the U.S. and to a hospital near my sister's house.  Other sister and I hop on planes that night and Dad arrives within minutes of us.  Mom was diagnosed with brain cancer and, with treatment, is given MAYBE months to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a nurse, so I do my research and we had her transferred to a nearby research hospital because, fuck that.  They accept the transfer, she gets a brain biopsy and new treatment plan and it looks hopeful, like we can beat this.  During this time, I have had multiple breakdowns in private.  My mom is the most amazing, generous, wise, loving human being I could ever hope to aspire to be like.  She's my best friend and my rock.  I left my kids and husband behind to rally by her and my dad's side.  Between my sister and I, we were with her 24/7 on shifts so that my mom was never alone and my dad took a shift during the day.  I was super concerned for him because she is the love of his life and I could not imagine how horrific and scary this was for him.  He has always been a stoic man and watching him break down and cry when they gave us the initial prognosis, gutted me.  

&amp;#x200B;

About three weeks into this nightmare, I was still staying there (sister's house) and about to shower after an overnight shift at the hospital when I overheard my dad on the phone.  He was having a sexually explicit conversation with someone, obviously not my mom because my mom was still out of her mind.  I was in the bathroom and the room he was staying in was right across the hall from me.  I heard him say things and immediately felt like I was about to have a heart attack.  I was gripping the sink and literally holding myself back from rushing into his room and attacking him.  But I also knew whatever I did would have lasting consequences and I was so mentally and emotionally exhausted, I didn't trust my own judgment... so I did nothing.  I went to bed and just stared at the ceiling.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to talk to my sisters but I struggled because, how can I add to their burden?  We are trying to cope with learning of our mom's brain cancer!  She's not even herself anymore and half the time, thinks we're a nurse and not her daughters.  On top of that, her recovery isn't guaranteed.  Even if she lives, she will never be the same, because the swelling in her brain did cause irreparable damage, but it's unclear how much of herself will come back.  It's a fucking nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple of days, I sat my sisters down and told them what I overheard.  To my surprise, they both already had suspicions.  We cried together and made a pact that for now, we can't tell Mom immediately because, she's literally crazy right now.  We decide that I will fly my father to my house after I return from being with my mom and confront him (I'm the oldest sister and I have -had- the closest relationship with him).  So, I go home because Mom is sent home.  I text my dad and say, ""Dad, I have something serious I need to discuss with you and it's important that we speak, in person, as soon as possible.  Please let me buy you a ticket up here.""  He agrees.  I meet him at the airport and I swear to god I thought I was going to keel over.  I have loved and admired and held my own husband up to this man, my entire life.  

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as he walks up in the airport, I blurt it out, ""I know you're cheating on Mom."".  His very first response, after waiting like 10 seconds is, ""It's not actual cheating, it's an emotional relationship.""  I sit there in silence and he basically vomits his life story to me.  My dad is truly a man of few words, but he just starts TALKING.  He tells me how unhappy he's been, how my mom let herself go, how she isn't happy anymore either, how he isn't willing to give up on life but all she wants is to be a grandma, etc etc.  He tells me how all these women throw themselves at him and it's hard to come home to a wife who doesn't care about romance or adventure or being fit anymore, how she's changed...  I felt like I had been bitch slapped.  This upstanding, Christian man who drilled loyalty, commitment, love is not a feeling it's a choice, ideas into my head my whole life.  So not only is my mom crazy and basically not my mom anymore, but my dad too.

&amp;#x200B;

He tells me he loves my mom and he will never leave her but he will never find a partner in her, especially now that she's had brain cancer.  He wants basically a poly relationship, which is bullshit because she can't consent.  He also told me he's been seeing a therapist for a few months before the cancer and it sounds like the therapist is encouraging my dad to find his own happiness and leave my mom.  Well f that, SHE IS RECOVERING FROM BRAIN CANCER!!!  He would destroy her!  It's a little thing called IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, my mom does get better and better, but she's still a long way from close to her old self.  She has lost all of her hair... a ton of weight (she was not fat before but wasn't in-shape and now she's skinny).  She can't control her emotions, like we'll chat on the phone and she'll just start bawling and apologizing for what she put us through.  It KILLS me.  Meanwhile, my dad is carrying on.  My sisters and I are taking multi-month turns having our parents live with each of us so we can help care for Mom.  And it feels like I'm lying with every breath I take.  But, I can't tell her what's going on.  I do't know what to do.  She'll make comments about how she feels so bad that dad has to worry over her and what genuine love he has for her and I just have to go along with it.  If she ever does get better, our relationship will never recover from this because I'm LYING for him.  

I feel like I'm betraying her.  I feel like I'm in cahoots with my dad.  I feel like I'm going insane.  Help me?

This story goes deeper than what I've written but I'm not trying to write a book and it's details probably irrelevant to the main issue.  But, I will try to address any questions you may haven to further clarify."
"I always feel like my fiance is on a one sided war with my family My fiance (33m) and I (31f) have been together for about 9 years. At the beginning of 2017, I broke up with him because he wouldn't commit to marriage and kids and we stayed broken up for most of the year, but remained in contact. In the middle of us breaking up, I took a small trip with my family, and from that he believes that my family convinced me to break up with him for good. I was up front with them that I was ending the relationship but it's not like they were rooting for me to end it. But in his eyes, back in 2017, they had it out for him. In my eyes, they're just doing what any family would do and support their daughter/sister who was ending a relationship.

We went through a lot of shit that year but ended up reconciling and trying again in December 2017, and we even had a heart to heart with my parents about us getting back together. Since then, it has felt like my fiance is easily triggered into this mental war with my family. My sister had a 1 year birthday party for my nephew, and in the invitations she only wrote my name on the card. At the party she brought my nephew over and introduced everyone at the table but didn't say my fiance's name. Later he got extremely angry about the party, saying he felt like my sister was purposely ignoring him. I talked with my sister about it, she apologized and said none of it was on purpose.

Since then, I have personally felt like my family has tried to warm up to him. I see my sister trying to show she cares by being very active in helping me plan our wedding. But at Christmas, my sister bought me an expensive KitchenAid mixer, my assumption being that she was buying it for us as a household. In fiance's mind, she only bought a present for me and completely ignored him.

Last night we did a video call with my family, and a few times they tried to get my nephew to say hello by going ""look! Aunt (my name)!"" ""Come say hi to (my name)!"". He stormed off mid video call angry that they never pointed out that he was in the call. In my mind, most of the things he reacts to feel like non malicious mistakes. I thought nothing of it mid call, because I could see myself doing the same thing they did. And I just felt deflated when he said something after the call was over, because it feels like there's this constant war against my family. I told him ""I don't know what to say. I can't control my family."" And now he won't talk to me because I didn't agree with him. Even to this morning, as I write this he's purposely sitting in another room away from me.

I don't know what to do because from my perspective, it feels like he's trying to find problems where there are none. But I don't want to write off his opinions, so I do try to think about it from his perspective. It's just he thinks it's all done purposely, when I think they're mistakes not done with malice."
"I feel like a bad friend I’ll often just drop off of conversations for days on end, sometimes a week, because I just feel too exhausted to maintain conversation, and I don’t have the nerve to tell people why. Then to top it off I’ll just feel guilty about dropping off and not saying anything to the point where I’ll feel too shameful to try and explain myself and turns into this weird cycle, even though I know the solution is simple and most people would probably understand. Why am I like this?"
"So at the moment my girlfriend has lost feelings for me and I believe she is going to break up with me but still want to he friends but I dont know how that would work since we've been together for over a year It hurts alot to think of us as friends because we never started as friends, we went straight into a relationship and grew from then but she has confused feelings for me at the moment and said that if she cant find it to love me then she'll still care for me and wants us to be good mates but I feel like it'll be very awkward, I don't know what to do."
"My sister (23F) and I (26F) shared an apartment last year, but things quickly took a turn for the worse, and now we don't speak anymore. Back story- My sister and I were really close until she started dating this guy 3 years ago. He is 12 years older than her, yet is extremely immature, and made her cry on a regular basis during the first year of their relationship. I used to spend long hours consoling her and trying to give advice. All of which were disregarded. After their fights, they would suddenly make up, without explanation. And the cycle would continue, driving a wedge between me and her. So of course, I can't stand this guy. 

Last year, they were still dating when my sister and I got an apartment together. Things were fine at first, but his frequent visits quickly became longer and MORE frequent, until eventually he was practically living there. Showing up without notice, sleeping in after my sister left for work, using our supplies, etc. Yet never cleaning up after himself or helping with any of the bills. Even his mother joked that he should be paying part of our rent, since he spent so much time there! 

Time went by, and I became more frustrated, but couldn't find the right time to talk to my sister, as our work schedules were usually opposite. Then one day I exploded on her over text, after they left the kitchen a huge mess. My mistake. I shouldn't have let it go on so long. But even after apologizing for losing my temper, my sister completely shut me out, and wouldn't listen to anything I had to say. Instead, she accused me of being a hypocrite and brought up old arguments from the past. There was no way to move forward.

Our lease was coming to a end, but we decided to extend it an extra 6 months. However, I told her I wouldn't pay for her boyfriend anymore, and he needed to pay 1/3 of the rent, or no deal. She flew into a tantrum, refusing to make her boyfriend pay for ""visiting"" her. BUT HE WAS LIVING THERE. 

I explained this to our landlord, and he agreed with me. This set my sister off again, and she asked me to move out, saying she could find someone else to replace me. I said fine, and my boyfriend offered me a spot at his house.

WELL when my sister couldn't find anyone, she told me she would be moving out too, and had to cancel the 6 month lease renewal. Didn't matter to me anymore.

That was six months ago, and we have since gone our separate ways. She is still dating this guy. We used to be best friends, and it really bothers me that we don't even see or speak to each other anymore. Anytime I try to reach out through text, she responds with one-liners. It's clear that she wants nothing more to do with me.

And to make matters worse, most of our mutual friends have stopped speaking to me. So she has probably been trash-talking me to them. I feel hurt and abandoned by my friends, too.

I guess my question is, was I totally in the wrong here? I miss our friendship, but I couldn't let her free-loading boyfriend barge in on our shared space anymore. I always thought she was smarter than to let a boy come between us. Is there any hope that we can be friends again? Has anyone gone through a similar situation?


// TL;DR- My sister and I used to be best friends until we shared an apartment, and argued about her boyfriend constantly barging in. We have since moved out and don't speak anymore. Is there any hope we can be friends again?"
"Rant - I want to block an ex boyfriend but I want to give him an answer why So...he stalked me in IG. yeah, he found my account on one of those social media and began to beg why I left him. Idk? Maybe because you sound clingy as h and your voice in video-chat feels so off? 

&amp;#x200B;

truth be told I quit chatting him through a chat app because I felt there were so many red flags. I don't want to sound racist, but even though he was a second generation Argelian living in Italy, his English was....mild to put it in an euphemistic, optimistic light. Second, seemingly all of his former girlfriends seemed to be from Christian background but their parents were actually very optimistic. Until something clicked. I guess it was something like he calling me ""mine"" or whatever when I was very unsure.

But again, red flags waving all over.

These days I've grown to realize I also like girls and began to understand why I feel sexually aroused by porn with women sounds. I was literally heartbroken one time when I was a teenager after a friend simply ghosted me.  I feel attached to women, so it's not ""oh, I realize i'm suddenly queer"". No...it was there. I simply denied it ...because feeling a dick is also pleasurable. I'm afraid this guy will react so badly when I say ""sorry, but I'm trying to date girls right now"" and it's not a lie. Also COVID-19 makes me realize how women are sometimes, a lot more patient than men."
"Covid19 long distance relationship So me (F/27) and my boyfriend (M/30) have been separated due to Covid. We’re a pretty new couple who have been together for 8 months now. I went home two months ago to help my family, with grocery runs and errands, who is high risk and he went an hour away to be closer to his family during this trying time. We both zoom every night together: making tea, watching movies and catching up after a day etc. However due to the elongating separation, these past couple days I’ve been starting to feel like the romantic feelings I’ve had for him are starting to fade away. I don’t want to feel that way and I know I miss him dearly.... but I can’t help but feel something is missing. Zooms just feel artificial. I love being stimulated intellectually with deep conversations, so in my case I feel like I initiate a lot more of the conversation with out a lot of questions reciprocated towards me. As a very open person, I’m starting to feel lost. I also feel ashamed and sad that I feel this way. I honestly don’t know what to do... I don’t know whether to stuff this down and see if this phase runs over or if I should talk about it. I don’t want to hurt my SO and make him doubt our relationship in the process; especially because he suffers with bipolar 2 and this could be a trigger for him. I need some advice"
"I (21M) couldn’t get hard, and I’m so embarrassed So I posted another post about this not to long ago, but I’m just curious if there are any other guys out there who have had a similar problem. I was in a relationship for a long time and never had any problem getting hard, if anything I couldn’t get soft. The sex was great. I’m not with her anymore but recently I found a new girl who I really like, and I think she’s beautiful, I want to have sex with her and I finally got the opportunity. But I couldn’t get hard. No matter what she did I just couldn’t. It was HUMILIATING. I don’t know if I just wasn’t horny, or if I was nervous or what. Like I wanted to have sex but my dick was like nope. What do I do to not have that happen again, lol. Is it just a timing thing with her being a new girl? Has anybody ever had this happen? It was so embarrassing and I’m like too embarrassed to even talk to her now."
"I fear my GF might have cheated on me Hey guys, i'm gonna tell you my story however i must tell you first that english ins't my mother tongue and i've learned it with movies, games etc.. so maybe it will be packed with a lot of gramatical mistakes so i hope you could understand me.  


I've been with my gf for nearly 2 years, we had some difficulties in the past because i was her first ""serious"" bf in almost 5 years and she wasn't familiar with the ""formalities"" also her ex was an over jealous abusive and that created on her a sense of privacy that is almost on the extreme levels. On the other part my ex cheated on me and i developed a lot of trust issues so in the first months it was very difficult for us but we kinda find a ""comfortable"" spot.   
She is a lonely individual like me, i mean we both have friends but we are not haging out with other people very often (we do it sometimes), we both live with our parents, i'm a lawyer and had several economical backwards after i tried to live on my own and she is just starting with a new bussiness (she is a health professional) adding that we are from a third world country where is very hard to gain independence because there's a lot of unemployment and economical opportunities are scarce. even with that ""limitations"" we manage to see each other almost every day i help her on her job and she help me in my office sometimes so we have a great time and fill each other in too many ways.  


The thing is... last september she send me a message at 9:30 pm telling me that she will be haging out with a couple of former college friends, it was late and she have to work the other day so i was kinda suspicious about it but i knew one of the guys and i didn't put much trouble, the thing is that the other day i wake up just to find out that she returned home almost at 3:00 am and when i asked her what she did she told me a lot of things with a lot of details (something strange in her because like i said she had a profound sense of privacy). She told me that one of the guys (the one that i knew) never arrived and she spend the night alone with the other guy drinking beer in a bar near her house it was strange to me because she got home SO late and she don't like to drink so much, also was strange the fact that she told me that she took a taxi when the bar is just a couple of streets away from her home and the neighborhood is very chill,  that thing just make me more suspicious and feed in me a doubt that i carried for months;   


A few weeks ago i decided to get rid of that doubt and did a thing that i regret and i feel ashamed, even if i had trust issues i've never looked in her phone without permission even if she let it alone with me and go away for several minutes, but this time, she hand it to me because she needed me to call some of her providers to buy some medicines while she was attending a patient and after i did what she asked i started looking at the conversation with the guy, i jumped straight to the date of the date they had and what i found leave me in shock, this guy was straight telling my gf to go to a local motel, it had a lot of sexual references and even when my gf wasn't playing that game with too many interest wasn't rejecting or puting the guy in place, also i found some other details that make me doubt of the things she told me, like the bar they went because in the conversation said they would meet in another bar and the conversation next morning was ""i'm so tired, it was a incredible night"" ""i'm so crushed"" and stuff that i might think they had sex. after i read that i leave the place without telling her and started thinkin in ending the relationship straight ahead but you know.. love, i didn't want to lose her and even when some parts of the conversation were kinda weird it wasn't explicit that she cheated on me, however it gives me a lot of reasons to think she might.  NOTE: this guy live in another city and was just visiting.   


After that i commited another mistake, with this heavy weight in my heart i decided to find more about the guy and i called a friend of my gf that have a pretty good relationship with me and told her what happened, i know that i can't trust in her entirely because she is more loyal to my gf than to me and she is also friend of the other guy, but she told me that this guy talks to every girl like that and he was like that in college too, and they are used to it so that's the reason why my gf and her never stop him, because they don't take him seriously; but to be honest i don't buy it, it's sound very weird and shitty to me because i know my gf and she is very cold and never likes to be explicit in those matters even with me.  


so i want your opinion, im 100% sure that if i ask her and told the truth that i checked on her phone the relationship is done for good, but i can't carry with this weight anymore, even when she send me nudes i suspect that she send it to him first, also we are already having other problems but i know that is because of that i mean, i've chaged a little with her after that and she notice that change too."
"I [19F] am not too physically attracted and head over heels to my gf [19F] and it's bothering me. A bit of backstory, we met first year of college, that was last year. She had been crushing on me for a while till she confessed to me just the sem ends. But i told her that I only see her as a friend. And we did remain as one

I was in a really bad place mentally and academically back then and almost dropped out. She helped me deal with my breakdowns and even helped me get through my finals. I admired her for her patience with me and there are times that I actually taught of dating her. We ended up flirting from time to time, became FWBs. That didn't last long as i had to go home as the sem ends. Over the christmas break there was 1 time i told her i liked her and retracted it the next few days saying i was just a little too emotional and i'm actually unsure of my feelings yet. That hurt her a lot of course but we still remained as friends. A bunch of breakdowns later and she was still for me. She was a very nice person and i thought i wanted to give it a chance. So I finally told her I want to give it a chance and i asked her to become my gf, she said yes. I was hoping I would learn to really love her. I love her at least as a friend and she is really special to me. We have been together for a few months now and she is a really understanding, mature and smart person.

Now about her. She would often describe herself as one of the unnoticed group back in hs. She never dated anyone back then. On the other hand, I was a little popular back in hs bc of my extracurriculars, i had a bunch of friends and had several flings and a gf. She has a low self esteem. She is not ugly. She is actually naturally beautiful. She gets complimented beautiful. It's just that she didn't really learn to take care of herself that much back in hs. She doesn't really care much about her fashion sense or how she looks but even so, i think she is still pretty. But it's the first time that I actually am not head over heels over someone i'm dating. I'm not very physically attracted to her. Our sex life is really good, i think she is really hot during sex but on normal days I see her as just as average and not really that physically attractive for me. We have been doing good so far. I'm usually the one who has issues that has been resurfacing and she helps me with them. I realized a lot of things because of her and I think I am growing a lot because of her. She is a bit insecure sometimes and needs some reassurance from time to time. I really also do my best to make her feel loved at all times and be understanding and patient to her as she is with me. 

But still, the feeling of not being very in love with her is bothering me. I think in the near future it might cause some problems on how i interact with her because I totally don't want to hurt her. Any help with this? Any insights? I don't think I want to break up. This is by far my best relationship so far and I'm growing a lot with this person and i want to give her my all too. Sometimes i also feel like i loved her because she loved me first. Is that wrong? I can definitely see her being a long time partner because of mature she is and I also have fun when i'm with her. 


TLDR: Got into a wonderful girl that i'm not really very in love with. That lack of ""head over heels"" feeling is bothering me and i'm afraid it might cause some problems with our relationship in the future. I'm a messy person, got some mental health issues and a little immature but she is helping me grow. I don't know how to proceed."
"I (21F) am unreasonably mad at my bf (23M) during the pandemic Hello everyone!

I am coming here for some advice on how to handle my anger during the new situation we're all facing. My bf and I haven't been together for too long (just 2 months) and half of our relationship has been affected by the pandemic. The result is that we can't see each other that often ofc. Our state is releasing the restrictions and we have been able to spend some time together, I went over to his place 2 times, always for a week and everything went smoothly.

Now to my problem. When I get home from his place, I'm bored and nothing seems to interest me. I had to move to my old house with my (not the nicest) dad bc of this situation and am generally upset about it, but I can't do anything about it for now. I start to be mad at my boyfriend for no reason. He has a lot of assignments, he spends time with his family and does other things, while I'm not able to get myself to do anything productive. And for some reason it gets me angry. I have struggled with finding a hobby before all of this and I talk about this issue with my therapist, since I stopped enjoying a lot of things in my life. I'm not a person to start fights and I am able to reason with myself so I don't bother him with all of this. 

I'm just looking for an insight, if anyone has gone through something similar, I'd be happy to talk about it."
"My (22F) friend (20M) told me that he doesn’t have feelings for me, despite all of our mutual friends telling me otherwise. I feel like I was set up for failure in this. I met my friend while TAing one of his college labs. We had a very professional relationship until the semester ended, but quickly became friends afterwards. He was super sweet and a really good time to be around. This was 2 years ago. Flash forward- I am recently out of a super long-term relationship, he is single, and our friends somehow convinced me that he had developed feelings for me. I did not know how to feel. On one hand, he is great; actually, he is everything I look for in a guy. Unfortunately, on the other hand, I can’t help but feel that he is too young for me and that he was a former student I TA’d. It just wouldn’t sit well with me, having people who witnessed our initial interactions know that I broke some sort of unspoken rule of remaining a professional TA-student relationship. 

It’s been a month since friends told me that he has developed feelings for me, so I finally decided to have a conversation. He seemed a bit shocked, and said, “I really don’t have feelings for you. I like you as a person, and you have a lot of amazing qualities I am looking for. But I cannot just put aside the fact that you were my TA.” I said that it was a relief to hear that. Though, somewhere deep inside of me, I felt a twinge I’d hurt; I realized that maybe I had unknowingly developed slight feelings and hearing him shoot the idea down, stung. I think he could sense that I was a bit insulted/hurt, and he finally said to me, “Maybe if we were to go out more, I would finally be able to drop that barrier in my mind that you were an authority figure.” 

I don’t know what to make of this. I feel like you don’t look someone dead in the eyes and say, “I don’t like you,” if you do. It seems super counterintuitive. Yet, he’s leaving the possibility of something happening slightly open. I don’t really know what to make of this.

What do y’all think?"
"My(29f) LDR bf (23m) has started smoking excessive amounts of weed since covid quarantine. How do I address this? My boyfriend is extremely intelligent, caring, honest and communicative. We have amazing facetimes almost every day and text through the whole week mostly all day but lately he has been smoking copious amounts of cannabis to deal with corona quarantine and is very depressed he cant come fly or drive and visit me. He also has his schooling on pause due to the situation. His state has said the quarantine could continue until next year. I dont mind the occasional weed smoking and I do it myself several times a week but he has gotten to the point of becoming a complete stoner smoking 8-10 times a DAY where it used to be 2 times at the most. He is falling asleep on facetime, napping for hours, and becoming so high he is not coherent when we talk. This is becoming a serious issue and I need to know how to stop him from turning into a complete and total pothead!"
"Me [19F] and my boyfriend [19M] broke up on good terms. How to move on when our feelings haven’t changed? I go to community college and applied for admission this Fall. I got into UCSD and UCLA, and my boyfriend got into UCSD and decided he was going there. He didn’t want to do long distance because it would have been too hard for him, so we broke up last week. He said he would give a week to consider the LDR and today he told me he thinks we should work on ourselves. He said he’s not going to date for awhile, 1-2 years, and that he’s not actively looking for anyone since we basically got out of a 3 year relationship. 

Currently broken hearted and crying while writing this. He wants to work on himself because he realized there were times when he was toxic, and he didn’t want to do that to me anymore. He told me he wants to learn to be more patient with people and become a better person. He said I should work on myself too, because he knew I felt insecure of myself and relied on him to feel happy.. which was true.

We talked on the phone and we both agreed our feelings haven’t changed, but the situation has. He said he wants to be with me but for selfish reasons (that he loves me and all of that), and told me he thought long and hard about what’s best for me and him. I agreed, but it’s still so hard to move on.

I know we JUST broke up the pain is so real. The fact that we met when we were 16 and becoming somewhat adults together and finally able to be independent and start our own lives.. and kind of have that ruined during college admission decisions came out makes me so sad. There were so many things I wanted to do with him once I got to university.

He said maybe if we are ready and are still interested in 1-2 years (which is towards graduation) we can possibly get back together. I will probably not date or sleep around in university because I want to take this time to learn and become a better person by myself. He is planning to do the same.

Any advice on how to move on from a relationship that ended on good terms, and both are still in love as they were before?

tl;dr broke up with boyfriend due to university and other things on good terms. how to move on.."
"What are your YSK’s for serious relationships? I don’t have a specific question per say, but I’m in my first normal serious relationship and trying to understand what “normal” is. So I’m looking for your “you should know”’s, what you’ve learnt, what to expect, things to keep in mind. I know every relationship is different so keeping that in mind :)"
"GF guilting me about her past My GF brought up a really sensitive topic about her past last night when I was trying to express how I thought things were going in our relationship. Long story short, she’s recently been prioritizing her friends over me and I needed to sit her down to talk about it. When we sat down to talk, our conversation went from me expressing how she’s been making me feel (which has been pretty awful) to her bringing up this emotional weight from her past and how it affects her. She told me that the reason she spends a-lot of time around her friends is because she doesn’t think about this thing from her past when she’s with them. In shorter terms, she feels accepted. I asked her if she feels that way around me or if I make her feel that way and she said, “No.” I then asked with helpful intentions why she holds onto that type of “emotional baggage” and she took serious offense to that and stormed out. I believe that this emotional weight she holds onto really does affect her a lot, all I was trying to do was understand and help her. But, I guess the way I put it made it seem like I think of her issues as insignificant and now I feel very guilty. It has now completely overshadowed the original issue at hand and the way she has been treating me or how I’ve been feeling (which is pretty lonely and unappreciated)... that may be a pretty selfish thing to think. But still, I feel like it was very out of left field and I shouldn’t be feeling this type of guilt. Maybe I should though? I don’t know. 

She refuses to talk to me now because she “just can’t believe me right now.” I said one phrase, and I was only trying to help.

I need ADVICE!!!"
"Bf calls me annoying for wanting to spend time with him So we’ve been dating for a while and live together. And this has always been a thing where i ‘m annoying because when i want him to spend time with me i want him not only physically there but mentally too. So i always call him out when he’s on his phone etc. it bugs me that he calls me annoying because i give him his time to game and what not. But it always seems as i ‘m sacrificing my time to be with him just to keep him happy. 
But i feel like i ‘m just a piece of furniture, and only of good use to cook and clean and entertain him when his “boys” are too busy to game. 
Am i being emotionally irrational? Am i just jealous of how he spends his time? 
Oh also he has mentioned how he wishes i could find ways to entertain myself more because it would make his life happier since i wouldnt big him as much. 

Is this a lost cause? Should i just conform and realize this is how it’s always going to be?"
"Idk what to do My fiancée and I have been together for almost 4 years come next month. In that short time we've had 3 kids. The first one was never planned and we found out she was pregnant with about a month and a half after we got together. Well, it was a surprise to both of us but we started transitioning to parent mode slowly. The second one was actually planned and she had begged for, so we had our second. The third was also unplanned and we had actually considered an abortion because we weren't in a very good financial situation and were struggling with the other two already. Needless to say, we couldn't afford to pay for that so it got scrapped and we became set on being the parents of 3. My 3 year old is not what I'd call a normal child and is overly rambunctious, and makes life very hard on us, whereas the other 2 aren't so bad my themselves. So, all that being said, My fiancée is the love of my life and I have no desire to be with anyone else and I'd be devistated if anything e ever happened to her. And I feel like I ruined her life by having a child with her and then giving in the her begging for the second child and then the third. She talks a lot about killing herself because she can't handle the children anymore and I don't know what to do. I love her so much. Like I said, my children are quite rambunctious and don't make things easy at all. Please somebody tell me what to do to help her, I don't want to lose my partner and my kids mother. I'm not a great parent myself and couldn't do it without her. Any advice would be amazing and so greatly appreciated"
"My (19F) brother (22M) is so unhygienic and disgusting and the resentment I have for him is taking a toll on me So to start, both me and my brother live at home, and before anyone says “just move out”, I am in school full time and only work part time in order to stay on top of my studies so I’m in no position to move out.

My brother, who I’ll call Jeff, is 22 and has always been very unhygienic. He won’t shower unless my mom tells him too, has never cleaned his room and therefore you can smell his disgusting BO from the hallways and I haven’t even seen him brush his teeth since we were in grade school. My family and I have told him multiple times how much we dislike that we can smell him from several feet away, and my parents are constantly reminding him to shower or take down his dirty laundry. If it was up to him, he would wear shit stained underwear everyday of his life. 
On top of Jeff being gross to be around, he’s also a man baby. He acts as if the world owes him something. Any time Jeff is asked to do something around the house, he throws a fit like a toddler would, or he agrees just to get my parents off his back, then doesn’t do what he’s asked. My parents have resorted to paying a gardener &amp; buying a romba vacuum to do his chores because he just won’t do it. 
Jeff excuses a lot of his behavior on the fact that he is depressed, but I just don’t think that’s an excuse; I’ve had depression for most of my life, I am on anti depressants and see a therapist regularly, he however stopped seeing his therapist because he was lying to her and therefore it wasn’t helping. 
Jeff also has very unhealthy eating habits. My whole family has always struggled with weight, however everyone in my family still eats somewhat healthy, except Jeff. Jeff orders out almost everyday, and he doesn’t just eat one meal, he will literally eat an entire large pizza by himself in one sitting, sometimes eating 1 1/2 pizzas or the full 2 that he usually orders. I am not the most healthy person, so I find it hard to judge his eating habits, however I’ve noticed that every time I see that he ordered more pizza or something, my anxiety just skyrockets &amp; I feel guilty even though there’s nothing I can do about it.

I’ve talked to my therapist about it, ive had a group therapy session with Jeff, I’ve talked to my family about it, and nothing has / is changed. I’m at my wits end. I’m just full of hatred and resentment for Jeff at this point, I’m disgusted by him every time I see him, and every time I hear the doorbell ring because he’s ordered more food I feel immensely anxious and guilty. I just don’t know what to do anymore. What can I do to get through to Jeff?? What can I do to stop feeling guilty &amp; disgusted by him??

"Was i (33F) right to breakup with him (37M)? LDR 3 years. Never met in person. We were LDR. He never cheated and i know he's sincere and even offered(3x) to marry me.  
Told him we should see each other 1st in person before he proposes because some people gets surprised upon meetup.  


We lasted 3 years. had 3 breakup attempts from me.  
1st : Because his replies usually takes 1-2 weeks.   
Said he's busy with business and is doing everything almost by himself because   
employees can't do it right like he does. So, basically tied to his work.  
  
He also attempted to travel, go see me here in Asia. Said he didn't get approved   
because of a shameful health condition he won't mention to me. This is where   
things started to turn.  
2nd : Because he didn't greet me Marry Christmas and Happy New Year and was almost ghosting me for 2 weeks b4 the breakup.  


3rd : He won't show up on  our video call. we only did at least 5 or 6 video calls all those 3 years. said he has insecurities.  
He's black.   
He thinks he's not handsome but idc.  


I don't know if what i did was right.  


Mostly I think he has avoidant attachment style and I'm the anxious type.  


I broke up with him and he just didn't reply at all.  
i got ghosted after i broke up with him.  


I think we're still worth trying again but now at a loss.  
Please give some insights."
"Im in love with someone else This is going to be a long one but please help me! 

I have been in a relationship for 3 1/2 years with (J). We met sophomore year of highschool when i first moved to his school. We both got into relationships shortly after we met and never got close until 2 years later (senior year). Senior year came around and i had just gone through a bad breakup that previous summer and was kind of wilding out. All i did was skip school, smoke pot and party (he was expelled, so doing very similar things minus he didnt HAVE to go to school). We started dating shortly after re-connecting. We were pretty happy but i was young so i cant really say we ever had any similar life goals or anything like that...we partied and did everything our parents told us not too.
Fast forward a bit. He had cheated on me a few times now (i dont know exactly how many) but i always took him back. Well, after a split and us getting back together i got pregnant. 9 months later i had our son and thought finally things would work out (they have to right we are a family?!) turns out, i changed into a parent and he didnt. This is where my HUGE problem with him started. He partied, dis whatever he wanted while i took care of our baby. Eventually, i fell out of love with him. 
I dealt with it for awhile..

Then i met someone at work. This guy (T) and i became good friends. I developed feelings, but not because he had “everything” my ex didn’t have. Because be had morals, goals, and wanted a family, house and career. All while my (at the time) boyfriend would take my car every night when i got home, go do drugs and we (my son and i) wouldn’t see him for days on end minus the car exchange. 

So, i left. I got my own place. And pursued my feelings for this other guy. Everything was great until this coronavirus thing came around.
I truly feel stupid. Manipulated. Used. My ex really got me worried about everything to say the least. Saying he had to be with us if we went into lockdown. I was understanding because everything was so new and we didn’t really know what this “virus” was going to bring us.
So i let him stay st my new place with me and iur son.
I told (T) that i needed some space and had family stuff to deal with. I was devastated the moment i said that. I knew it wasnt right.
Now coronavirus is over. And i want my ex out but he thinks everything is back to normal. Im
Not in love with him anymore. And i recently apologized to (T) for my choice to push him out of my life because i can just feel it in my gut that it was such a mistake. 

Am i making the right choice? Why did i leave (t)? This is all mindfucking me. I know that i dont want to be in a relationship with my ex (J) and i want (T)."
"How do I(f16) get out of the friendzone with the boy (16) I've liked for two years? I say I've liked him for two years, but it's been on and off. I'm basically looking for advice as to how to make him see me as a girl that he could date, rather than just a 'bro'.

I've dated a few people over the two years but it was always very fleeting or silly (probably because it was high school), yet he has always stayed single. We were really good friends last year and when I was dating a girl, I told him that I used to like him (not in a weird way, and the girl that I was seeing knew I told him, so it's all good). At the time, I hadn't wanted any kind of response - it was pretty much just a joke because everyone thought I was a lesbian.

Either way, at the time it was pretty clear that he didn't have any romantic feelings towards me. There was actually a school trip last year as well and we sat next to each other on the coach, and at one point he literally showed me his snot and said ""I would never do this to a girl that I liked, so don't worry"" or something along those lines. That really stung, because on that trip it was probably the most I ever liked him (until now). Yep, I even liked him after he showed me his snot lol.

He's never been with anyone before, and he's not exactly what you would call 'popular'. (neither am I, to be fair). He had a bit of a reputation in school for being unorganised and a class clown, and I think a lot of girls were put off him because of this. Of course, since I was his friend, I thought all these traits were funny and after a while I found them really cute and endearing.

He's quite handsome as well, but again, not the type of handsome that the 'pretty girls' like. He isn't super tall (5'7 or 5'8?) and he's not skinny either, but he has really pretty dark eyes and a really nice face. If I didn't like him I'd probably wish more girls found him attractive because he's genuinely really underrated lol.

He replies to my messages really quickly and we've met up outside of school before (though not as much this last year, and it was always with one other person at least. Always platonic, of course), we have similar senses of humour and he's really kind and sweet and if he were to like me, I think everything would pretty much be smooth sailing... It's just that he doesn't see me in that way AT ALL.

I'm not really pretty, and I'm not ugly either. I would rate myself a six out of ten, or maybe a seven (or eight...?) on a good day. He's probably a seven if I look at him objectively. The only girl that he's liked in the past was at least a nine (all of these scores are in just looks, using for reference), and of course I helped him try and get with her (like the idiot i am). She 'led him on' though, so I think he might be cautious before he tries anything else. he liked that girl for maybe three years, but this was at least a year ago now and he definitely doesn't like her anymore.

I think the main reason he doesn't see me as dateable is because I'm not particularly 'girly'. About three months ago I got out of a six month long relationship with a girl (the relationship was really problematic, lots of fights, etc) and I've been over it for a while now, but when I was with this girl my style totally changed. I basically started dressing like your everyday lesbian with the sweaters and the chains and stuff. I don't mind dressing like that, but I've been trying to dress girly-er and stuff ever since we broke up, because I like how pretty tops and skirts make me feel all elegant and stuff.

He probably just remembers me as the lesbian though, even though he knows I like boys as well. Being in quarantine makes it hard for him to really see the cute outfits though.

Can I have tips on how to get him to see me as someone he could date? His interests are basically just memes, music and coding/computer stuff. He has a good taste in music but we don't really listen to the same stuff. And he likes computers but I prefer books and literature and stuff so in some regards were kind of opposites but that's not really an issue with me.

Plus, I feel like every time I try to make the conversation deep he just makes it jokey again. I don't think he's avoiding that on purpose, he just sees me as a jokey 'bro'. Like today, I was showing him pictures of my dog, and he kept replying 'didn't ask'. I know he's just messing around, but I just want to be like ,,, pls ask :(.

Sometimes we message really late at night, and it's not deep or anything but sometimes it seems flirty...?

What kind of stuff can I do to attract this sort of boy? Not popular, kind of a nerd, funny, that sort of thing. Especially considering I am already firmly in the friendzone. He's not desperate either, so if I told him I liked him and he didn't like me, he would just be straight-up like 'no', which would suck.

I don't want to 'change myself' for him either. Just want to show him that I can be a girlfriend to a BOY as well as a girl."
"Need some advice! (Repost because I didn’t request anything previously. Pls only comment if you have genuine feedback and would really appreciate detail!) 
Pardon me, English is not my first language. 

I’m a 20 year old (F) who has recently been seeing this guy. Things are good, we get along very well and he is like my best friend. However I feel that the needs of a man and woman are very different in romantic settings. Though I have asked before, He is also not very vocal with his feelings (needs and wants) because he wants to accept what I have to give. I feel it is very sweet of him to be so accepting but I would like to make him happy too. 
I understand the answer may be different for each person but my question is, What can a woman do to make a man feel loved and secure? And that being said... what makes a man stray from you?"
"I’ve been faking orgasms for 1 year, and want to tell him. I’m sorry this may be a little detailed... I know I am wrong in this situation but please don’t judge me as this is just a little part of the story. I just request for you to give me a little advice, please. 

I (18F) have been with a guy (20M) for the past one year. We are in a long-distance relationship at the moment.

I lost my virginity to him. And the first two times we made love, I didn’t orgasm.

At first he didn’t mention it, so I didn’t feel pressured to have an orgasm, I was just enjoying myself and didn’t care about my orgasms. 

You could say I only cared about him, and thought that when he was done, my fun time was over and that’s that. I was okay with it.

The third time he mentioned that I don’t orgasm, I said “I know, I just need to get used to...this”. 
I usually masturbate, and climax by myself, but with him..nothing.

So the next time came where we made love, and there was my first time... feeling pressured.. and I faked it. I then told myself I won’t do this again but...I felt like it wouldn’t be fun for him so I faked it over and over again...

Now we are in long-distance, and we have webcam sex... normal stuff for LDR (just saying..), and even when I masturbate I CAN’T ORGASM... but have to fake it as it would be weird to stop all of a sudden. 

I visit him sometimes and I still fake it. I feel like this will be an endless cycle. That the problem is definitely me. I can’t orgasm without something stimulating me visually such as porn... and I feel like a disgusting liar, who is somehow broken and can only function through porn. I feel destroyed. 

I don’t know how to tell him, he will think I am this fake person, it will ruin his confidence too. I really enjoy making love, but it’s just the climax that I can’t reach...

After a whole year of me sabotaging my relationship, I don’t what to tell him and how to fix this. Because next time we will try be intimate whether it be when I visit him or when we see each other through a screen... everything will seem fake to him and it’s like I won’t be able to repair us.. because being in a LDR is hard as it is already. 

The damage I have caused is disgusting but I feel stuck. What should I do?"
"He can't change I told the guy that I like that he can change when he said that he's not relationship material. He said that he's 26 and he can't change drastically. I told him he doesn't have to change drastically. To which he replied"" I have to. I have many open ends and entanglements in my life"" WHAT?"

"Was my (f24) ex-boyfriend of two years (m33) really that abusive? Or am I just bad at working through problems? I apologize ahead of time for all the run-on sentences. I’m just sort of pouring it all out here. 

I left over a week ago. My last three days with him consisted of him having huge angry outbursts, calling me stupid way more than usual, and at several points telling me to leave (we were living together). 

One of the things he got angry about, during one of my last days there, was me putting too much water in noodles I made for him. I’d tried to follow the directions, because he always got so mad at me for not following directions close enough (I was scared to death of messing things up because he’d get so mad and act like he hated me the rest of the day if I did). So I made these stupid noodles we’d bought, and I’d somehow skipped over the amount of water to add when reading the directions. He got so mad, he refused to eat them. He said that he can’t be with someone who can’t follow simple directions, that he feels like he has to be my parent in order to be with me (he said this often). 

He’d just bought a shotgun. I’ve been wanting to get into shooting at targets for fun because it’s something my family would do often growing up... but I didn’t think I could ever get a gun because my ex had struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past. I just didn’t think it would be worth ever buying one. But he insisted on getting this shotgun for personal protection, because he thinks the pandemic will get dangerous at one point (I tried talking him out of it due to my concerns, but I couldn’t ever talk him out of anything if I wanted to). And well, I thought maybe if he felt okay about getting that gun, maybe I could also get my own at some point. 

Well, when I messed up the noodles, he told me he didn’t think I could ever own a gun. Because if I can’t follow the directions on a noodle packet, I was incapable of remembering directions for handling a gun safely. 

My last night there, I checked his blood pressure manually. I checked it in part for practice, because I was working as a caretaker at a senior living facility and had to do so for work. I always feel like such a dork, checking people’s bp manually... my ex also struggles with his weight and has a tendency to have high blood pressure. I thought about that when I bought the cuff in the first place, because I thought it might be good to sort of check his blood pressure every so often. Well, the cuff was too tight. So I tried doing it on the other arm, and he flipped out. Told me I’m fucked for not just respecting that he hates me checking his blood pressure (even though he’d given me permission to do so). And he said I should just practice on his mom (we were living with his mom, I had been paying her rent because he didn’t want to get our own place as he works in film and doesn’t always have steady income). Well, I’d bought a bigger cuff to use on him specifically, it wouldn’t have fit his mom. So I told him I got a size that would work for him to practice on, and also to sort of keep an eye on his blood pressure. So then he got really mad and screamed at me, told me I was manipulative, and then he said he was going to kill me. That scared the absolute hell out of me, because that’s not an expression he ever uses. He then told me to get the fuck out of his life. 

All of this stuff was pretty normal. Even him telling me to leave. He pretty much told me to leave whenever he got super angry at me. And he’d get super angry at me a lot. I mean, a few days before, he’d told me I was incapable of being sexy. He said he thinks I’m “hot” and “beautiful,” but I just can’t be sexy. Some people have it, and some don’t. And I just don’t, according to him. So the next day, feeling ugly as all hell, I decided to do my hair and makeup. And he got fucking upset. He acted cold towards me, just didn’t acknowledge that I made myself up. I mentioned that, and he told me that I do “that” every time I get ready. That I expect him to compliment me, but I don’t look any better when I do my makeup. He said I always look the *fucking* same. I don’t need makeup, so he’s not going to compliment me when I wear it. We were on our way to the store at the time, he even turned his truck around and said he was done with the relationship because he was done with my bullshit. I frantically apologized and begged him not to end things, so he forgave me and we went shopping. 

Anyway, my last night there, after he told me to get the fuck out of his life, I walked away for a bit to compose myself. When I came back, I asked him if he meant it (he always takes back wanting me to leave, either because I apologize or he changed his mind). I told him I seriously needed to know, because I could make it so he never had to see me again. His response was, “yeah, bye.” 

So, I called my mom. She and her husband live in Arkansas, and he and I were living in Utah at the time. They’d known about my relationship already, so when I called and told them what happened, and said I think I should actually leave this time, they were extremely supportive. They bought me a plane ticket right away for the next morning. 

I came back inside and began to pack up my things. He was still angry. I told him I’d be leaving that next morning. He went into our room and sulked. Then he started crying. I didn’t go in to comfort him for a while, but when I did go in, he acted angry again. He told me that I’m stupid and can’t make good decisions for myself. That I’m making a huge mistake being with my mom, and that she made the decision for me. That everyone makes decisions for me because they think I’m too stupid to make them on my own. So I walked away, and I called my mom again. She reminded me that, no, I was making the decision to leave. Nobody else made that for me... which is true. I did make that decision. It’s just so easy to forget when you’re constantly being told that you’re incapable of doing that for yourself, I guess. 

So yeah. I packed my things, I ended up going in and hugging him because he’d been crying. He apologized to me, said he treated me so badly because he hates himself. And I said I’d miss him, but that I had to leave. He opened up about a lot of his insecurities that night, and it just felt like it was too late. I didn’t feel as bad for him as maybe I should have. 

And since being in Arkansas with family, I’ve struggled so much with missing him. I keep feeling like I’ve made a huge mistake. He’s fought to contact me and apologize profusely. He’s promised to get help, he’s promised to fix everything that was wrong. He’s telling me everything I’ve always wanted to hear, and it’s so hard not to just go back to him. I had to block him on everything. And then he’s just made new accounts to contact me... so I’ve had to tell him to respect that I don’t want to talk and give me space. He hasn’t contacted me since I’ve done that...

But yeah, things here aren’t perfect either. My nine year old little sister throws tantrums, my mom is a bit overbearing, and I have no privacy. But I can’t get myself to fly back to Utah to be with him. And I can’t help but wonder if I’ve made a huge mistake. I keep thinking about all the good times I’ve had with him, and I keep remembering what I wanted out of that relationship. And how I’ll never get what I wanted out of it... and it hurts. 

I guess my question is, was he that emotionally abusive? Was I being overly dramatic? Am I just incapable of working through problems? I just want to know. I felt like I couldn’t deal with  any of it anymore, but I genuinely wonder sometimes if it’s me, and if i gave up on something that could have been good eventually. 

One of the things he said to me before I blocked him was “we never really worked on things, you just put up with my bullshit.” I don’t know if that’s entirely true. I did ask him to stop breaking up with me whenever he got angry, and he promised to stop. He couldn’t keep that promise. I also asked him to stop calling me stupid, and again, he promised he’d try and continued to do it. 

Thanks to whoever read all this.

TL;DR my ex called me names and broke up with me whenever he was upset, so I moved across the country to be with family in a more stable environment, and now I’m wondering if it was a mistake."
"My (27F) mom (54F) is catching onto my numbness towards her; how to cope? Sorry, this is a bit long, but I feel that back story and detail are sometimes necessary. I will try to summarize with a TL;DR at the bottom.

I've always had a rocky relationship with my mom I guess. 

As a kid, she was always angry and combative. Quick to start an argument with anyone. I always feared her, not because she hit me but because she just was scary when mad. I tried to never rock the boat. Never got in trouble, straight A's &amp; B's, always did my homework without being asked. Probably needed correcting on the occasional chore though.

Growing up, her anger was mostly targeted at her own mom or my dad. Now that I'm older, I actually think he was the only one who'd listen to her and quickly became a punching bag for when things with her own mom didn't go well. My mom would fight with my dad about anything. Maybe he brought back the wrong pizza from the grocery store or had the TV volume too loud. It could be anything and it would become a screaming match. My dad never yelled back, I watched him simply take it over the years (which is probably where I learned my similar behavior from). She would scream, hit him and throw things around the house...just for things to always end with her telling my younger brother and I that she is leaving and not coming back. She always came back within 24 hours. I could never be upset though, because I needed to comfort my brother and dad (they would always cry when she left). Once I entered middle school and earned a cell phone, she would leave like usual after a fight, but now text me while she was gone. She would send vague texts of ""I can't do this anymore"" or ""I love you, but I'm hurting"". These would then follow up with her saying she was at the bridge (we live near a major river). She would text me saying she wanted to jump so bad and that she was sorry. These texts messed me up pretty bad. She would tell me not to tell my dad, so I would lay in my bed crying on school nights at odd hours of the night not sure what to do or if she was serious.

I started resenting her eventually. I entered high school and made friends for the first time. She hated all of them and would make up reasons that they were people I shouldn't hang out with. This caused me to jump from new friend to new friend until eventually no one wanted to be my friend. When I got my first boyfriend, he wasn't good enough either. He actually was terrible, but because of the amount of times my mom made me feel isolated, I had no intention of giving him up. This sparked the first major arguments between my mom and myself. I would ask to go hang out or see a movie with him and she would always turn it into a screaming battle. Heck, one time she threw a microwave off the counter at me she was so angry. I held onto him though because it was my only bit of freedom, even if he was a jerk. 

I finally moved onto college and broke up with my high school boyfriend. I was able to see he was a jerk and made friends that didn't experience my friend hopping behavior in high school. I kept these friends safe and didn't talk about them to my mom. 

Eager to move out, I left home at 19. This tore my mom apart. She still to this day will remind me how much I broke her heart by leaving at a young age. But I needed the freedom.

Once I moved out, she would hold over my head the only two things she still paid for. Car and health insurance. Any time I did something she didn't like she would threaten to remove me. Finally I decided to just take on more hours at work and find a way to make school work just so she couldn't have anything over me.

Fast forward to me meeting my current husband. Of course she hated him too. I didn't care though, he was so understanding of my situation and calmed me every time she acted up. He never asked me to cut out my mom or treated her differently based on she treated me. He always could put on a friendly face for her and put aside his anger for how she treated me.

This lasted till our baby boy was born two years ago. My mom was obsessed with him. She wouldn't let anyone else hold him at the hospital and constantly told my husband and I how we were going to raise him. We politely ignored her, but one night she was on the phone with me at 8PM and I told her it wasn't a good time, that our son was crying (4 months old and having issues falling asleep) and we were trying to get him to sleep. She asked what we were doing to get him to sleep and I said well my husband is holding him in bed and trying to soothe him. We got off the phone and that was that.

Or so I thought. She came bursting through our front door within 30 mins of hanging up (she had a spare key for emergencies) and demanded to see our son. I told her he was sleeping and that her actions were completely uncalled for. She pushed past me and entered OUR bedroom and hovered over OUR bed that my husband and son were sleeping in. I told her to get out and she refused and literally just stood over the bed staring. I grew uncomfortable and eventually said I'm calling the police. She then complied and I asked her in the kitchen what her problem was. She said that she though we were 'holding him down on the bed'...like pinning him to the bed and was worried that our weight would kill him. Like...what on earth??? I told her that was ridiculous and she said she can't help where her mind goes. She's always said her mind goes to worst case scenario due to her past.

This brings us to current day. My husband now does hold some resentment towards her (which I don't blame him). He tries his best to not let it show, however some times when she acts up in front of him he will make a face or walk away as to not say anything. My mom has noticed this and thinks he hates her, which is a constant argument between us. He doesn't hate her, just indifferent now.

She recently started going to therapy (probably for the last year). She bounced around to different therapists until she found one she liked. I fear this one is actually feed her toxic behavior...not the therapists fault because they only go based on what a patient tells them. Based on the reactions from past therapists, my mom has learned what to say to get the response she wants (really the medication she wants). She takes volume multiple times throughout the day with alcohol...which is usually when she decided to call me and decide I've done something terrible to her. This happens probably 2-3 times a month. She talks about her troubled past with her therapist a lot, which she did go through a lot with an abusive mom. However, she also likes discussing problems that she has with my brother, dad or myself. Of course she can tell her own story however she likes. The therapist then gives her advice and agrees that we are horrible to her. My mom will then use that ammo and literally call us as she drives back from therapy to tell us what her therapist thinks of us.

Every holiday, she decides to pick a fight with either my brother, dad, me or all three. The fight will start off with her saying she is canceling said holiday because we don't appreciate her enough or one of us did something that set her off. Even when I'm not the one at fault (ie brother/dad did something that upset her), she will still call me and start the conversation upset with them, but end it with her actually being upset with me for anything. It could be I said something in a conversation last week that was off putting or how I moved out at 19...anything. Never anything recent or relevant.

This brings me to yesterday evening. She called me and opened it with ""I don't want to be a mother, so don't bother coming over on Mother's Day."" Trying to be calm and found out the deeper issue, I asked her why she felt that way. To which she replied that none of her children love her and she must have failed as a mother by being 'too good' to us. She then literally said, ""I should have abused you both, then you would have loved me. Abuse victims always love their abuser."" I was literally applaud by this statement. Still, trying to be calm and not triggered by her I told her that was simply not true and that we do love her. She then went on to say that my younger brother upset her earlier that day by not being grateful that she got a job for him during this pandemic. I was a bit surprised and asked her for further details. She apparently called my dad's boss and told him that he should give my brother a paid internship since he is graduating college top of his class (for business) and would be a great addition to his company. She did not tell my brother she did this and next thing he knew he was receiving a call from my dad's boss asking if he would like an internship. My brother accepted and called my dad to tell him the news thinking since it was HIS boss, that he had something to do with it. This outraged my mom. I told her that it makes sense and sounds like a misunderstanding and that she should just simply tell my brother what happened. She said she did and that my brother then was embarrassed that she called our dad's boss and asked for such a favor. That he felt better thinking it was at least our dad who maybe had a conversation at work with his own boss. My brother then told her that he wished she didn't do that. Thus why she became upset, because he didn't appreciate her gesture.

My mom is known for these 'gestures' that are a bit over the top and kind of embarrassing. We think she means well, but they usually put someone in an uncomfortable position. Like, how do we know my dad's boss was even genuinely interested? 

Anyway, I tried to talk her through my brother's feelings and chalk it up to a him being young and it being his first real job and something that he would've liked to have earned himself. That he didn't mean to come off the way he did.

Somehow...this turned around on me, because her next line was, ""Oh don't act like you're any better. You don't appreciate me either."" I asked her what she meant and that I thought our relationship recently was improving. She stated that I don't appreciate how much she watches my son. I told her that simply wasn't true, that every time I pick him up I thank her and how much my son loves his nana. Plus...she hasn't even watched him since the pandemic because I've been working from home...so again she is brining something up that isn't actually relevant. I told her that it's a shame she feels this way and if she truly wants to cancel Mother's day because my brother did respond appropriately to her gesture that I would understand, but I think she will come to regret not spending time with us. She then said, ""I just don't want to be a mother anymore. Love shouldn't hurt this much."" I got a bit fed up at this point and told her then don't be a mom, focus on herself and get better. I told her I understood that it is hard not getting to be your own person and then provided the example that I am a mother, daughter, wife, or work colleague. Just stating that it is hard not being able to focus on yourself and that if she needed that time I would understand. To which her reply was, ""Well you can forget being a daughter. I'm releasing you from that duty."" Again, very frustrating. I told her that wasn't a fair conclusion to come to after my statement and that she new that wasn't what I intended. This caused her to start crying and talking about her abusive mother. This is usually her go to when she doesn't have a good response. She then says all she wants is for her children to love her and appreciate her.

I'm not going to lie. I've grown a bit numb to her and no longer love her. I say it to keep her at bay, but there is no meaning. I don't like her as a person either. I simply tolerate her because I don't believe cutting her out is a realistic option. I've tried in the past and she just blows my phone up and shows up at my door or workplace. It just isn't worth the hassle. However, I am growing tired of proving to her I appreciate her. I don't know what to do other than be grateful for when she watches my son. Her examples were, ""Why can't you tell me that I'm the best mom ever or how awesome I am?"" Well, because she isn't. I can't tell her that, but I can't bring myself to say those things either with meaning.

I guess my problem is that I don't know how to properly fake a relationship with her anymore. She is catching onto my numbness. Again, cutting her out doesn't seem realistic. I feel that would cause even more problems unfortunately. 

I just want a way to cope with her. I see a therapist, take anxiety medication and feel I do my best. Yet, I'm left with this feeling that every time my phone rings and it's her that I would rather die. I'm not suicidal. There was a point in my life, however my son brings way too much happiness in my life for me to ever consider that again.

Any advice would be appreciated and thank you if you made it this far!

TL;DR: My mother's behavior is intolerable and she has begun catching onto my numbness toward her; how should I cope with her?"
"My (24f) bf(24m) keeps sharing my nudes... with me Throw away account. Keeping this as short as possible.

Edit: To clarify, he never shared my nudes with his friends or strangers. I didn't have a problem with him saving and enjoying my pics. Then he started spamming ME with MY OWN NUDES.

A while back, I stopped sending nudes to my bf because he would spam my inbox with my nudes. At least 15 times a day, I'm staring at my own chest, butt, full body, etc.I asked him to stop multiple times until I got fed up and just stopped sending him pics. I went into his phone when he was sleeping and deleted all the ones he had saved. Including the ones in a ""secret"" folder that he thought I didn't know about. Then I went onto his computer and deleted all my pics he had backed up there. By the time he woke up, all of my ""content"" had been erased.

Now he's upset because I deleted his favorite pics and I'm refusing to send him anymore. Honestly, I think its really really weird and creepy that this is what he chooses to do. He never shared them with friends (thank god). Just who thinks that's an okay or normal thing to do? I kinda want to breakup with him over this. What do you guys think?"
"Is it normal for your SO/the person you’re talking to to cuss at you and point out all your flaws/belittle you every argument? Hi everyone, I’m new here and I just had a question regarding the above. I (22F) met a guy (21M) on Reddit a year or so back and we hit it off right away, talking every day etc etc. It was good for a while but eventually we started arguing, and I quickly noticed that his arguing style is to belittle me and point out my flaws with lots of cussing whenever he had a problem with something I was doing, whether it was not responding for a day or me not wanting to listen to him rant about some thing or the other etc. 

I admit, I would also cuss back at him but I never really knew how to cut him with words the same way he so expertly could do with me. It’s almost as though he specifically watches me for flaws and documents them somewhere in his brain to bring up during our next argument, calling me things like, “fucking hypocrite” and “fucking egotistical”, all the while staying with me and still talking to me. Is that gaslighting? Or is this just a normal argument, the kind you apologize for afterwards?"
"Please help - I'm very confused :( Hi all, 

My ex-boyfriend and I (29F, 30M) have dated for 5 years, and mutually decided to break up end of Jan 2020. We love each other a lot, however we have been fighting way too much and have tried many times in the past 5 years. At first I was happy about the break up, but as time has passed and I was left alone with my thoughts in quarantine I realized how much I loved him, and how much I was willing to make things work. We remained in some contact mainly him calling me, up until a month ago where I told him to not call me unless he is ready to talk about our problems, because small talk was really hurting me. 

He called me Monday night, we had a 4 hour long conversation. During our break up I have been going to therapy, reading, journaling, working on my issues which contributed to our break up. I thought I was getting better, and had it all under control. I was ready for two outcomes, 1 - we get back together, and work on our relationship. 2 - we never do. Well, hearing his voice made me melt. He initially called me to ask me if I was seeing a friend of his, To which I of course said no, because I am NOT. We then got to talking about us. I probed him about how he felt. His exact words for 4 hours were **""I love you a lot, i miss you, I think about you too. Just because I don't tell you how sad I am about our relationship ending doesn't mean I am not sad. There are a ton of things that remind me of you, and the great times we had. But at this point I cannot make a decision. I feel like I don't know if we will ever work out, because our personalities are clashing a lot and we've been fighting forever. I am not saying that we will never get back together - because I don't know that, I do love you. But a part of me feel like I don't know if we will ever work out""**. The reason the conversation lasted 4 hours is because I am pathetic and I cried, and cried and yelled, and screamed and called him names. I am not proud. I was extremely heart broken to not hear what I was expecting. Childish I know, but I am so in love with him and so willing to take another chance. **I kept asking him ""well then you must not love me. How can you claim to love someone so much but not be willing to try again, you're lying to yourself and to me""**, **to that he would get heated and say that I am making assumptions about his feelings. I also told him i felt like he was lying about loving me because when you love someone you cant bare to be without them, even during a global pandemic. You would risk the idea of it not working out, just to try again. To which he said - we have tried so many times, I'm not sure what the future holds, who knows, maybe we could work out one day, that's why I'm telling you I don't know, because I genuinely do not know."".** 

My questions is, I genuinely do believe that he loves me, he cried, I cried. There is love. I can understand how he is being the rational, mature and level headed one. As I am the emotional, pathetic wreck here. I called him and we spoke every day since Monday. A**ll i kept trying to do is get more answers. It just feels like yes, he loves me, but not enough to try again - right? What does it mean? I love you but I don't know if we'll ever work out. Is he giving up? Seems like giving up to me. Seems like I am not worth taking that risk one last time. I just don't know.** I am left feeling not good enough, not worthy. But he spent the past 5 days on the phone with me every night telling me how much he cares about me, loves me and doesn't want me to feel unworthy or unloved, and that hes sorry he doesn't know what the outcome will be. People get married all the time without knowing the outcome..but I guess those people are not fighting like cats and dogs...is he giving up on me? What does this mean? I'm losing sleep, I have no appetite. I cant do anything. I just keep replaying this in my head. Its been 4 months since our break up, I thought I was doing so well.. please help. **Hes saying we should take it day by day, and focus on each day rather than looking too far into the future and getting overwhelmed. Our fights weren't good for either of our mental health, and contributed to our anxiety. But does this mean he thinks we had more bad days than good?  Please help, I just need honest 3rd advice.**"
"How to tell if my(22/f) boyfriend (22/m) is losing interest or he’s just comfortable in the relationship? My boyfriend (22/m) and I (22/f) have been dating for 4 months. We’ve been close friends for a year and I’ve known him for a couple years prior. When we became close friends we snapchatted throughout the day, send eachother things on Instagram, texted somewhat, and we’d also talk online later at night. We became like best friends almost instantly. I never felt this way with anyone before. We both caught feelings and started dating. We talked all the time, we’d FaceTime more and things continued normally. Up until the second or third month of our relationship.

He sorta pulled back, didnt FaceTime, I would ask to FaceTime and he’d say he would be busy with homework, he stopped sending me as many things online, we still talked at night when he was done work though. Lately, he will open my snaps and not answer, or like yesterday I sent him a text and he didn’t respond for 10 hours. (I sent him the text at 1:30 pm and he had work at 4:00pm) but he had the time to go on his Snapchat before work (we have snap location on.) I sent him a sweet text and he responded with something sweet back but didn’t even acknowledge that it took him forever to text me back at all.

I no longer feel like a priority in his life. I wouldn’t care as much if we saw eachother every other day sort of thing but I only see him on the weekends. During the week I don’t really know what’s going on with him and he doesn’t really talk about how he’s feeling and even when I ask it’s usually just a “I’m doing okay.”

I’ve brought up the issue of not hearing from him as much and he has made more of an effort to at least text me in the morning and at night. He will sometimes FaceTime me at night too. So I can tell he’s trying. He tells me he loves me and wants to be with me for the rest of his life. 

I thought maybe I was just being insecure but I’ve been doing a lot for myself and I’ve been trying to keep myself busy and I still get these waves of emotions about my boyfriend and I. I’m feeling less secure in our relationship. Especially since he’s been driving his co worker home and it’s a woman and when he first told me he referred to her as “they.” So I didn’t know if it was a guy or girl at first. 

Sometimes they grab wawa after work and I’m not sure if they hang out in his car or not either once he gets to her house but it makes me kind of uncomfortable. He’s told me at least about him driving his coworker so he’s not technically hiding anything but for me, I feel like he’s getting emotional energy from his coworkers and then I get the “scraps.” 

I just miss him wanting to want me, talk to me, send me things on snap or insta, I miss him acknowledging the texts I would send and the music I would send him. I give him so much of my love and affection and I don’t always feel like it’s reciprocated. I feel taken advantage of and I don’t know how to bring all this up without coming across as insecure. I can’t tell if he’s lost interest or he’s just comfortable. I know everything about him, all his bad habits, etc. We’ve said how it feels like we’ve been together for years.

How can I bring all this up to him? Is he losing interest or is he just comfortable? 

**tl;dr** my boyfriend and I used to talk all the time, he was always responsive to snapchats or texts and now he barely acknowledges them. He still makes an effort to text me in the morning and at night and lately he’s been face timing me more than usual this week. I don’t wanna bring it up because he’s been getting in contact with me more again but I’m still upset about it and I don’t want this to turn into resentment."
"My Boyfriend (28/m) gets frustrated when I (27/f) can't hear him. Now it's just getting mean. This is so minor compared to posts on here, but it's honestly driving me crazy especially with corona times. 

At least 4-5 times a day my boyfriend will say something in passing, to himself or under his breath, and I will catch only a few words. My natural reaction is to say ""what did you say?"" or ""what"" because I didn't catch it. 

Now, he's said several time to me that he is ""concerned about my hearing"" or my hearing as I get older. He also has started to get really frustrated when I ask him what he said, to the point of being pretty rude. This morning I even told him he was being a bit of a jerk, and he said that I don't understand how frustrating it is for him. 

Reddit. I feel like I'm going crazy. I have literally never had hearing issues, I don't struggle to hear anyone else, this isn't an issue in my life except with my boyfriend (should I just call him Mumble McGee?). I don't know if it's me, him, both of us or maybe I'm going deaf? Should I stop asking him what he said and just stay quiet? 

I feel like if the roles were reversed I wouldn't be so cruel about it."
"ThrowRA_I know I’m not the only one I (28m) have been with my wife (30f) now for 10 yrs now. 

She has been and continues to be nothing but good. 

Through the years, we have both changed. Our interests collide. Slowly, we became distant, I more than she. Yet, she still sticks around with a big smile that breaks me apart. 

She followed me for a four years while I was active duty. While I was in, I slowly gave up on what I wanted to do because she was never on board. Even after getting out and wanting to pursue the type of career. I got out so that she would have the opportunity to start her career, since she always complained that it was because of me, that she became stagnant. 

I am slowly approaching my two year mark. In this time, I feel I lost myself. I am no longer in love, but I absolutely care and love this girl. I want nothing but the best for her. I feel she deserves it. Again, she is noting but good to/for me. 

We don’t have sex anymore, cause of me. She has expressed that frustration and I have been honest with her about it. That I just can’t mentally get in that mood. I feel internally broke.  I want to better myself, for her. 

But I feel like I am doing more harm than good. I feel this way because I know I am only here waiting for her to get on her feet, to become independent and not need me anymore. I have not and won’t tell her that. 

I don’t know what to do anymore or how to even approach the situation. She doesn’t deserve the hurt. 

I’ve come here because I have no one to talk to.

Advice?"
"Me (M23) and my roommate (M22) messed around last night and I don’t know what to do to not make it awkward now. Okay so I’ve been in quarantine with my college roommate, we’ve lived together for 2 years now along with another guy who went to quarantine home. So now it’s just me and him. Anyway, both of us are straight, at least I am. He had a long term relationship with a girl before so I never assumed he wasn’t. But last night we got to talking about being lonely and stuff and somehow we ended up doing stuff - making out and hand jobs. Nothing more. But I feel really weird now because I’ve never done anything like that with a guy before. I’m not sure if I wanna do it again tho but it’s stressing me out now. And today morning I woke up and he acted like nothing happened. Both of us haven’t talked since the morning bc we had online lessons to attend but I don’t know if I should bring it up and if yes how? Did it mean anything to him, like does he like me or was it really just because he was lonely and stuff? I don’t know but I think wanna ask him about it but I don’t know how and what to say to not make it awkward between us. Any advice anyone?"
"I feel my [21M] girlfriend [20F] started artificially increasing her texting reply times to get back at me for not texting enough? I've been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now, and been official for 6 of these 8 months. Everything is pretty good but I've noticed something weird in her behavior for the past month.

She would always complain that I don't text her enough and don't reply fast enough. I have been explaining to her that I usually leave my phone away from reach when I'm busy doing stuff because I like to focus on what I am doing in the moment. So if I'm working, I will leave my phone on my bed and only check it once every hour or two. If I'm playing games with friends, I will charge my phone and leave it on silent etc. I feel like my phone not only distracts me from what I'm doing at the time, but it is rude to my friends/work if I am consistently on it while I'm supposed to be giving them my attention at the moment (even if its online playing games or work from home)'

However, if I actually have my phone on me I will reply to her usually within 5 minutes,

She would always complain about this, but has now started artificially increasing her reply times to me which I find kind of weird and immature. Whenever I reply to her now, she will read it almost immediately (within 2 minutes), then purposely wait about an hour to respond.

I find this kind of rude because I never leave her on read. If I have the time to open her message and respond to it, I always will. It's almost like she will open my message, read it, then think to herself ""I am going to wait a long time to respond to this now"". I know she is intentionally not replying to me because she will pop up active several times until she finally replies to me.

Any idea on how to bring this up to her? Or should I just drop it and accept we will only text every few hours now.

**tl;dr**

Girlfriend purposely opens my messages and waits an hour or two to respond, because I am unable to open her messages when I am genuinely busy."
"I just got caught catfishing someone and I feel horrible, what should I do? Throwaway because this is super embarrassing. 

So I (18F) have a fake Snapchat account that I use to get pot/ get nudes (everyone thinks that I’m super straight so I don’t want them to know what I’m into). I’ve had a streak going with a guy that I really liked from high school but never had the courage to talk to. Two nights ago he messaged me asking about one of the snaps that I sent him. I messaged him back and we ended up having a full conversation and we seemed to hit it off really well. I didn’t lie to him about anything he asked me when we were talking I told him that we went to the same high school when he asked Etc. 

Last night we were talking again and things were going well until he asked to see what I looked like so I told him my name wasn’t actually “Valarie” (Snapchat name) and he told me that he wouldn’t be mad he just wanted to see me. So I told him who I was and sent him a picture he didn’t seem mad. He just told me he thought it was funny bc he thought I actually liked his best friend not him. But the thing is he’s always really nice so I don’t know if he was just trying to spare my feelings. 

I really like him and I really wanna stay in touch. I’ve never been with somebody that makes me smile as much as he does. He’s honestly one of the nicest and funniest people that I know. Even if we don’t end up together I want to still talk to him at least and I don’t want to scare him off or make him think that I’m a freak( even though I’m 99% sure he already does). I don’t know how to explain why I have a fake Snapchat or even what to say to him at all. What should I say? How can I make this right? 

DL; DR: I talked to a guy a liked on fake Snapchat when he asked to see me I told him who I was. I don’t know what to do now."
"I (28M) want to improve my relationship with my Dad (70M) Background: I belong to a third world country and have had a privileged upbringing. No history of any abuse whatsoever. I live 2 hours flight away from my parents and visit them often. My relationship with my dad has always been strained and I feel like I have grown in a very toxic (for me) environment. Examples include having no sense of a happy family, no productive discussions within the family, no show of affection whatsoever. What led to this? The primary reason is running away from conflict. I know it's not the right thing to do but it has been our safety mechanism as a family to avoid altercations (which are quite frequent)

Recent incident: During the lockdown, my dad keeps finding small excuses to get out of the house to buy meds or visit doctors. He is a heart patient and takes around 26 meds a day which is not healthy at all. As he has become quite old now, his driving sense has deteriorated a lot. Last week he bumped into a delivery guy who ended up being in a hospital. The delivery guy filed an FIR (Police Complaint) against my Dad. I have been trying to employ a Driver for his car for about 6 months now but he won't let me. He is quite frustrated because of this incident and is taking it out on my sister (F39) and my mother (F65). He thinks of us 3 his enemy number 1. He believes that we don't respect him at all (which is absolutely not true) and badmouths about us to other relatives. He tells others that we don't care about him and asks other relatives for help, even though we are right here. Him being a heart patient, his eating habits are not exactly great. Point is, he is not fit to drive a car.

I have tried to have a decent discussion with him around 1000 times. He brushes me off by saying that I am just a child and uttering sentences like ""Who are you to teach me?"". I have taken a different route multiple times and tried to talk to him through other elders (His elder sister and brother) but it did not work as I'd hoped. This is taking a toll on my sister (her family as well) and my mother. 

How do I talk to him? How do you talk to a person who believes they are right all the time and are not up for a discussion? He's getting old and I want him to be happy and content. I don't know what the problem is. His kids are doing great and things couldn't be more ideal. He's troubled, I want to help him but don't know how I should proceed. The folks who have been in the same shoes, I want to know how I can salvage this relationship. Also, going through all of this. over the last two decades have resulted in me becoming very insecure about ending up like him. I'm his child after all and I see some of his traits in me (Like being very emotional &amp; getting worked up over small things)."
"I (20M) want to avoid my dad (40M) due to problems I now have with him and his mother. This has a lot of moving parts so I am going to try my best to keep this brief. My father is mentally handicapped due to a drinking and driving accident that he got himself into. Recently my mom broke down to me that before her and my father divorced (which was a small bit before the accident) that he would emotionally and physically abuse her. Me and my sister didn’t even notice it though I was only about 7 and she 4. So now knowing this and how much my mother means to me I don’t want to talk to him. It was hard enough to talk to him anyway with his disability. He also has anger issues and will scream sometimes when I’m there because he can only say a few words. In regards to his mom.

I learned that when she found out that my father was in the hospital that she flew to where we were and instead of coming to support us in the hospital they spent a couple days shopping instead. So essentially I feel like my dad and his mom just aren’t good people and don’t want to communicate with them but I worry that yeah sure he IS still my father, it’s just hard to think about what he’s done to my mother because I love her so much. 

The past few months I’ve just broken off contact with them, they have been messaging my mom for a bit asking where I am in which she tells them I’m busy with school, but my mom is supportive of whatever I want to do in this situation I just need help and I’m wondering if my feelings for them are justified or if I’m just being a gas person?

(I should also mention that seeing my father results in seeing his mom since he lives with her to be taken care of, she also does a bad job at that)"
"I (22F) don't know how to give my ex (23M) an ultimatum My ex (23M) and I (22F) broke up last fall because we were too busy with work and school, had no time for ourselves, and felt like our lives were moving in different directions. When it ended, we discussed the possibility of reevaluating at some point because we loved each other in spite of the need to separate. We have communicated every day since the breakup, and we see each other every \~2 months. 

The first time I saw him (about 2 months later), we hooked up, but I was adamant about the fact that I didn't want to be fuck buddies, so it was a one time thing. We agreed at that point that we would slowly hangout more and see where it went, but that never happened. Each time after then, we'd snuggle and watch a movie. I'd try to bring up the confusion I was feeling about our status, but every time I'd mention it, he said he needed more time. 

I have tried to be understanding because his job is demanding, and he is quite frankly married to his job. Just before the lockdown, I thought we were in a good place to have a conversation about our relationship, but now I have not seen him except while walking in our local park. We both moved home to be with family (we live in the same town), but now he is leaving to the state where he works, and I will not see him unless he comes home to visit. 

I still love him and care about him deeply, and I think he still cares about me, but I don't know if we can overcome this situation. If we could make it work and get back together, I would be overjoyed, but I'm trying to be realistic. I often feel like less of a priority than his other friends because I am so readily available that he doesn't miss me and go out of his way to make plans.

I want to be clear that I know he isn't stringing me along to favor of other girls. I was his first serious girlfriend since he started college, and he spends all his time working or focused on his favorite outdoor passion. 

I am terrified to bring this up to him because I am scared to lose my best friend, but I can't go on living like this. I need help processing these feelings and making a solid action plan. How do I bring this up to him? I would consider getting back together, but if not, I need to move on with my life."
He(15M) says we were too happy(I’m 14F) I know it’s highschool and relationships often don’t last but we were good friends before dating and plan to be for awhile anyways he told me last night that he feels like there’s no romance in anything we do and that since we’ve been together for 5 months or so that it’s just boring. We’ve had this conversation before it’s just I’m scared I’ll ruin our friendship with my anger and pettiness over this. I know we just need time to process but I’m worried that if I do anything wrong at all and try to make him understand my feelings he’ll just leave for good.
"Can’t finish Hey guys! nothing too interesting here but I’ve been with my boyfriend for a while now and I still cannot orgasm. it’s not a deal breaker for me but I would love to be able to! he does every time and says it’s amazing, but I can’t relate. It feels good when he does it but I get tired of waiting so so long to orgasm. i’ve stopped masturbating but it hasn’t helped. Any advice? thanks!"
"It’s been over a year and I still miss him. Mildly NSFW I’m not sure if this is the right place and if it’s not if someone can direct me it would be much appreciated. I just needed to let things out. 

TL;DR at the bottom 

I (27 m)was in a 3 year relationship until last March. We had an amazing dynamic and we worked great as a team. He was my best friend. We talked constantly. Barely fought. I loved him.

He was pretty motivating and always knew how to push me out of my comfort zone to get things accomplished. Extremely smart guy and very conversational. We were for the most part on the same page with what we wanted out of life. 

The few things that were issues for us were decently big in my opinion and what lead to us breaking up. 


He had really bad anxiety and depression issues. Im a caring and sympathetic guy and I tried really hard to be there for him. After 3 years it started to really take its toll on me. We would talk about it and he was actively trying to get help and get better. It was just getting to the point where it was seriously effecting how I felt in general and I began to not want to be around him because I wanted more positivity. Which makes me feel guilty.

Another big issue was sex.
He was very sexual. Always ready to go. I was very attracted to his personality more than anything. He’s a very handsome guy, but I found there to be issues in the bedroom all the time because he wasn’t exactly my “physical type” that I would normally go for but I put that aside because I really liked him. It would have been fine and I would have been able to overcome it more if he wasn’t so ready all the time. I’m just not as active as he was in that regard and it really started to get to both of us. I wasn’t doing enough to satisfy him. He was doing it so much that I started to dread it. It was the biggest downfall for us as a couple. Things lightened up. Towards the end but I still had issues. In the end I feel like it was all me problems and it wasn’t fair to him. 

The last couple months of our relationship were just rocky. We were a little awkward around each other. Things started to feel like they were collapsing. His anxiety, depression, and paranoia started to effect both of us. It just started getting really rough. All the while I was trying so hard to maintain things and keep going. 

Then one night he asked if things were ok between us and I just let out... “I don’t know”.....

We broke up the next morning. I ended up being the one to say we were done. 


It’s been a little over a year now. I think about him every day. Was in another relationship for a few months and it didn’t work out. I never stopped thinking about him. 

We actually met up for lunch a few months ago. It was really great and we were there for 5 hours just talking. When it was time to leave things became really emotional and we parted ways. 

We were chatting here and there but he started to feel very emotional about everything and I suggested maybe we should communicate less. I know he wanted to get back together. I haven’t heard from him since.

It hurts. He was my best friend. I feel like all the issues we had were because of me and I didn’t know how to handle them. 

I miss him. I don’t know if it would work if we got back together. I don’t know if I necessarily want to get back together. I’m so confused. I feel like I’m crazy and shouldn’t be allowed to love anyone. 


TL;DR
Was in a 3 year relationship. We broke up a year ago because of issues I was having that weren’t fair to him. I still miss him. I feel crazy. I don’t know."
"My gf (18) and I (20) consistently have bad dreams about each other, but last night we had them at the same time, in the same bed. It’s not every night, but last night’s occurrence is what led me to post here. We both had dreams about the other person cheating, lying, etc. When I woke up I was angry, at first, but then it settled and I went to work. My gf doesn’t have a job right now (she’s a stripper and corona closed her club down temporarily) so a few hours later when she woke up she let me know about her dreams and I was like “oh my god me too” and now we’re kind of stunned. What’s going on? 

I’m my dream she was lying to me 4 separate times about something (I forgot the specifics). In hers I was cheating on her."
"Why does she never say she loves me I know my girlfriend does love me, she’s said it before and she’s always the one who calls me first, but I wish she’d say it more often or at least say something that shows she cares like “I miss you” or “can’t wait to be with you again”. It would really give me a big boost during quarantine if she said even one of those things. 
Seems like it’s only me who says nice things like that and I always feel I’m there for her when she needs me but when I’m down she’s rarely there for me.

Am I being unreasonable wanting this? Should I bring it up with her? 
Thanks"
"A threesome gone bad (Long)

I (20f) have been with my boyfriend (23m) for going on two years, in the first year of our relationship we were doing long distance (although we have lived together for almost a year now) and would only see each other every few weeks or so. About 6 months into the relationship he brought up possibly having a threesome with another girl, I wasn’t sure that this would be for me and told him I would think about it. At this time he introduced me (via Snapchat) to his friend and coworker “C” (24f) and we were both talking to her regularly, the threesome was brought up and she said that she loved being with both guys and girls and would love to do this with us. I was still unsure if I wanted to have a threesome at all but was trying to get myself more comfortable with it and asked her questions about her previous experiences and we talked about it a lot. Near Easter 2019 though we had a bit of a falling out with C and me and my boyfriend decided to stop being friends with her, so I decided to tell him that I didn’t think a threesome was for me, while he was upset he said he understood and it wasn’t brought up again. 
 
Then in January 2020 C and my boyfriend started talking again, she had a loss in the family and needed friends which I accepted. My boyfriend asked if I would mind if C came over one night because she needed company and while I wasn’t sure it would be a good idea I agreed. The threesome hadn’t been mentioned in a long time and I didn’t know she thought it was still happening, I thought she just needed comfort. But after a few drinks she started getting very cuddly with me and eventually kissed me. I didn’t want it to happen but due to past sexual abuse have always had a hard time saying no (I know I should’ve said something) and I pretended it was fine. The threesome happened and I felt like shit. I didn’t want to be near her or talk to her and my boyfriend said that we would cut her out of our lives and be done with it. 

Now to the current situation: everything was ok for a little while until I saw my boyfriend was still texting C. I asked if he wanted to still be friends with her even though he said he felt bad about everything that happened and he told me that he still wanted to be her friend but since it bothered me he would make the sacrifice to cut her out. But I caught him texting her three more separately times, I realize it’s not that easy to just cut out someone you’ve been friends with for a long time but if you say you’re going to do it I feel like you should just do it. The last time I caught them texting was two days ago, we got into a fight about him trying to hide that they’re talking and deleting messages, I told him he can’t hide stuff from me and to just tell me when it happens. He said that he didn’t feel he could bring this up to me without me getting pissed at him but I would 100% be more pissed about him hiding stuff and he said it wouldn’t happen again. I just feel like I’m going a little crazy here, am I going about this the right way? He said she was a bad friend to begin with but doesn’t seem to want to stop texting her. I just don’t know what to do, any advice would be appreciated.

(TL, DR) My boyfriend and I had a threesome with his friend and I felt like shit over it, now he won’t stop texting her/ hiding it from me."
Is “I’m not in love with you” too harsh of a reason to break up. For a three year relationship. I’ve been trying to end it for months now. It’s been quasi long distance with no meet up because of corona. Is that too harsh? I want to do it as kind and calmly as possible.
"How do you guys feel about this? Hey guys, I just want to see if I’m in the wrong and how do you guys feel about this.

So long story short, she cheated on me 2 times before and left me for different men. 

Her excuse? She said “she hated every moment with them, she she never loved them. She explained that she never seen a good example of love and she’s sorry. That she misses me” now this is fine and dandy but not the point of the post, just some background information.

We hanged out and she cried and told me her life sucks and she hates herself. She said she’s miserable. So me being me. I offered her to be exclusive and we talk and we go through this together. As a team, so we wouldn’t be out of each others lives again. She declined, and said she wants to try and be happy on her own. I told her I feel like she’s just gonna mess with other men and I feel alone and Thrown away again, and didn’t understand if you loved me so much and missed me why wouldn’t you stick with me and work through everything with me. She wants to “not talk” until she gets in a better head space. She said she’s not ready for all that rn and I said but you seem ready with other people and never ready for me. I’m always on the back burner. She said she just wants to “live her life” So we fought about this for a couple days, eventually I told her I don’t agree and I love her still though and I hope she hits me up back soon. Then I noticed I’m blocked. I’m pissed, so I call her all day and she finally picks up and she said this, not word from word but close enough.


Me- why did you block me?

Her- because it’s too much to handle, there’s so many emotions and I’m sorry. I don’t wanna talk right now or maybe ever I don’t know...

Me- you promised me, you lied and told me you loved me.

Her- I do love you but it’s too much, I can’t handle it. I just want to be happy and I’m not, I told you I wasn’t ready. You bring so much emotion out of me.

Me- I’m always there for you, no matter what, and you wanna take 2 maybe more months of no taking again just to come back into my life when your “better” what’s gonna change? Your just gonna mess with some other guys again and the pain is gonna will again. 

Her-Fine I won’t ever talk to you again, you was happy without me, I’m just a mess up. I’m sorry. I know I shouldn’t have blocked you but it’s too much. 

Me- you don’t love me or miss me, you never treat someone like this.

Her- (she pauses for a minute)- I don’t want to be with you anytime soon...idk just not rn. I have a party in the morning. I wanna stop talking for right now...or maybe forever idk. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

Me-I hate you.


That’s the last convo and I’m still blocked. I’m upset, am I the problem? Do you guys agree with her or me? What do y’all think?

TL;DR my ex and I talked again and she left me again alone after giving up."
"My (f,23) bf(m, 21) never asks me to hang out. Am I just being oversensitive when I'm really upset about this? So I am going back to my college town where my bf(of a year) lives in two weeks to get tax documents, and asked him if we could fall asleep together. I have been self isolating and have had no contact with anyone, so I'm safe from covid, and he has only had contact with his 10 friends( all male) who all share a set of apartments. He told me he couldn't because all his friends were having one last party for themselves before summer, and he wanted to see them off, and that he would hang out with me the morning after, before I left. 

He also typically never asks me to do things first, claiming I just ask before he has a chance. 

Both of these things are deeply upsetting to me. I haven't seen him for two months and I had to ask if he even wanted to hang out with me. I told him this upsets me and why and he says that he would have asked and he does want to see me. 

But I feel so alone. Like if I stopped asking him to call and do anything but text we would only do something once every two weeks. 

I feel so devalued. Like... I want to be around him. He says he wants to be around me but then he doesn't try :(

But then he also makes sure to text me all the time, and whenever I really need him he is instantly there over text. And my mom is in the hospital and I have so many stressors and he is really supporting me emotionally in so many ways, and is very physically attentive when we are together and makes me lots of little gifts and stuff

Am I just being oversensitive?

Tldr:
Bf chooses his bros over me when I haven't seen him in 2 months"
"GF Indecisive So I been with my GF for 3 years now and we lived together for 2 years. We moved away together to another state. She goes to school and I basically support her financially. We’ve had problems in the beginning of our relationship and never really broke up and figured things out we just worked through it. We’ve intermittently had some more issues throughout the relationship, I feel that most couples would. Recently since this quarantine she went home (different state) for a week. When she came back we were on a topic about a couple we had seen that had commitment issues. She in passing, said she felt she had those same issues. I was confused as to what she meant. So I had her elaborate. She claimed because she is young (6 years younger than me) 21 years old. She feels she is missing out on this because she’s in a relationship. Obviously this made me feel pretty crappy considering we’re so deep in our relationship. I had a whole conversation with her asking why she felt this way and what I may have done. She claims while she was away she didn’t really feel like she missed me and she could have gone months more probably without missing me. She thinks her being alone all the time by herself because of everything being on lockdown it’s making her think this way, but this isn’t the first time she’s made this comment about the missing out on things. She says she wants to still work on it but she’s done with school in a few months. I asked if once she’s done would she still be with me. She can’t say she knows if she will be. I’m feeling used and that she doesn’t actually wanna he with me it’s just she has to be. 

What are your guys thoughts?"
"Gay relationship advice Hey Reddit 👋🏻 so basically my boyfriend and I (both 26M) have been dating for a little over a year now and things were amazing between us. I’m going to skip everything until the covid lockdown happened in our area. We were still seeing each other and hanging out but limited each other to car rides and visiting in each other’s living rooms.

Things were going pretty smoothly until i noticed that he’s been giving off cold vibes (read: any PDA feels forced, has a bit of an attitude whenever he calls me and doesn’t really want to engage in conversation, bails on doing stuff together like watch tv shows or movies over a skype call).

Naturally I got concerned and asked him if everything is alright with him. He said that it was nothing and that it was probably due to the covid lockdown stressing him out. I didn’t believe him but I gave him the benefit of the doubt and let it slide, but my gut feeling is going haywire.

A few days pass and I start seeing him less and less. I realized eventually that he was only asking to see me if there is ever a favor he needs me to do for him, but not to actually see me or catch up with me. Eventually all I can say is that his behavior towards me can be summarized as “cold” in every sense.

This eventually took a toll on me and I am starting to notice that I am no longer being enthusiastic around him, nor am I texting him at the same frequency or speed that we were used to at the beginning. In short, I’ve had it.

We met up one day and started talking about the upset dynamic between us. He finally confessed that he felt that his love for me was starting to get depleted and he requested to stop seeing and calling each other but still continue to text each other _“normally”_. 

Hearing those words I couldn’t help but want to run away to the farthest corners of the Earth. I feel like shit tbh. I never thought I would have to deal with this in my life. This has definitely triggered a depressive episode in me as my family have begun noticing that I’m always in a bad mood and my appetite has gone down to almost zero.

Am I crazy for feeling the way that I feel? Or am I overreacting? Is this just an bad phase or is it an indicator of worse things to come?"
"my (17m) brother (14m) refuses to go to therapy 
this is my first post on this sub so sorry if i’ve done something wrong. 

my (17m) brother (14m) has had anger issues and what we can only assume is undiagnosed autism his whole life. when he was five, my parents tried to get him to see a child therapist but that fell through for whatever reason (i was 8 so i don’t remember specifics). for a while we could handle it but recently he’s become extremely verbally abuse towards my mother (and sometimes me). no matter how many times we try to reach out to him and tell him that therapy isn’t a bad thing, he point blank refuses and insists that there’s nothing wrong with him. my mother has depression and this isn’t exactly helping her. i feel like we’re at breaking point, especially with lockdown. i know he’s my brother but he’s becoming a genuinely unpleasant person and i’m worried that he’ll end up treating any future girlfriends like this. i know that forcing someone into therapy doesn’t work, so what are my options? any help is appreciated. thanks."
"In a really good relationship, but can’t let go of my ex I’m a 33 year old female for reference. I was dating a woman for several months and we had a good relationship. We had issues here and there like any other couple. But we kind of settled in really quick and became like an old married couple. I felt there was no fire. She didn’t express her feelings a lot. But she was an amazing girlfriend overall and cared for me a lot and there was definitely love there on both our parts. I had a lot of doubts and ended things with her which broke her heart. But I felt I had to be honest with with her. 

Now I’m seeing someone new and she’s amazing. We had an instant connection. We are talking seriously about marriage and I love her a lot. But, I still find myself thinking about my ex a lot. She even called me crying recently and told me how much she misses me and wishes things were different. I have to admit I miss her a lot too. I have realized I still have very strong feelings for her. I think maybe it’s because I never realized how much she loved me and I didn’t give her a fair chance. So it’s almost like we have unfinished business. 

I have tried to put this out of my mind. But I literally wake up every morning with this ache in my heart for her. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should ignore these feelings and continue on with my current relationship, get married etc. or if I’ll spend the rest of my life wondering what if and living with regret. I also know if I tell my current girlfriend how I feel that there’s no coming back from that and it will ruin what we have. Even if we stay together things may never be the same. I’m so conflicted and this is on my mind constantly. It’s like torture. 

Advice please!"
"I'm (19F) jealous of my girlfriend's (19F) new friends I really need an outside perspective and opinions on this because I feel stuck and don't know if I'm in the wrong or not.

My girlfriend and I are best friends, we're extremely close and have been together for a long while now. We also share the same friend group that we hang out a lot and are really close with. About 2 months ago though she met a new group of friends, and she talks about them...a lot. She talks about the things they do for her, how close she is with him, the funny things they do, etc. And they have their own private group chat they talk with each other in.

When I mentioned to her that I felt jealous, she said I shouldn't be because she talks to them the same amount or even less than she talks to me/our friends. I feel really bad, because I trust her with everything, but I feel like I can't bring myself to believe that when it feels like she's always ""busy"" or doesn't have time to talk to me. She acts like she can't hold a conversation with me anymore and doesn't even respond sometimes while later on (could be hours, the next day, etc.) she'll go on about her other friends again and it makes me feel like the reason she doesn't have time for me is because she's too busy with them. She acts like she cares more about them than she does our group of friends, even though we've all been together for years.

I want to be happy for her, I want her to have her own friends and not feel like she has to be chained down to me and the friends we share, but I can't help feeling jealous and bitter. It's making me feel terrible about it but I don't know what to do to make myself feel better.

I feel like talking to her about it is useless too, because when I do it's like she doesn't fully understand how I feel or she makes excuses or gets defensive and it ends with us both apologizing for arguing without actually fully fixing what's wrong.

I can't get her to understand how I feel at all. Even if I say I feel like she doesn't talk to me as much, I know her response will either be completely denying it or that she's just too busy with other things, like work.

Should I try a different approach? Should I not even try at all and just do my best to get over it? Because I don't even know if I'm just overreacting and being too jealous about something I shouldn't be jealous about.

And please no comments about breaking up or anything calling her a bad girlfriend. She's wonderful and we have a long healthy relationship, I just have absolutely no clue what to do about this situation. It's not like I can just tell her to drop any new friends she makes, but I wish it didn't feel like she was replacing me and our friends."
"Hung up on old fights I (36F) am feeling like I am hung up on old arguments with my husband (27M). We’ve been married about 6 months and together for 3.5 years. 

When we first started dating, we were both fresh off relationships. I was uncertain about the age gap and the fresh breakups, but things felt so right I tried not to let it ruin what we had. 

A few months into our relationship he lied to me. He said he was going to help his friend move, which he did... but afterwards he met up with a female “friend” and bought her dinner and drinks... he met up with me later that same night completely hammered but keeping to his lie that he was helping his friend move all day. I found out some weeks later when she texted him and I saw it come up on his watch. He still didn’t tell the whole truth and it came out in dribs and drabs. He swears he didn’t cheat... and I believe him... she was engaged and frankly not interested in him... but I think he was trying to, failed, and it bothers me. He says that’s not true and he was just immature to lie to me. 

I forgave him and we moved on. 

Then I found out he had been on Tinder weeks into our relationship. Again, nothing happened largely because he didn’t realize he had clearly been messaging bots (haha) and doesn’t have much game... but it looks to me like he was trying for something to happen... he said we hadn’t said we were exclusive at that point (!!!!) and nothing happened... that he didn’t even want anything to happen but was being weird and stupid because he just came off a long relations hip... by the time I found out it was almost a year into the relationship so again I chalked it up to immaturity, forgave him and we moved on... 

Then I found out he’d been messaging his ex girlfriends asking them to come out dancing with him and a “friend” on the nights he and I would go out. So... he invited ex girlfriends on our dates... none ever came or showed much interest(most ignored him, because no shit, right?) but I don’t understand his end game there. What did he expect to happen if one did show up? I would have of course freaked out if an ex of his had showed up... and would not have pretended to not be his girlfriend... I legit don’t understand that one... it would have clearly been a shit show with his ex thinking he is a dick and his girlfriend dumping him... what was he trying to do?

So now I’m stuck. I love this man, I don’t believe he’s ever cheated on me and all the crap he pulled just seems juvenile and ill thought out... and there has been nothing since the first 6 months of our relationship... but it keeps coming up in my head that I think I made a mistake accepting that. Now I’ve signed on the dotted line and married him... and I am having serious regret about that because if he couldn’t be loyal in the early, fun parts of the relationship then how could he be loyal in the future hard parts? And not cheating because you were rejected is not the same thing as actually being in a position where you have the ability and choose not to. 

He is frustrated saying he was young (24) and immature and was being stupid... he wasn’t trying to cheat... he doesn’t know what he was trying to do aside from just being stupid but he had no intentions like that... and that it is not fair of me to think that is who he is and that I have plenty of evidence that it is not. 

Am I hung up stupidly? Or was I stupid to continue this relationship and commit to someone disloyal? Could anyone who acted like that actually be loyal in the long run?"
"Where did his sex drive go? I’ve [24F] been dating my boyfriend [25M] for about 7 years. We met in high school, did long distance in college and now we live together and moved in together to a new city about 1.5 years ago. The issue is, we haven’t had sex in about 5 months and we’ve only have sex around 3 or 4 times in the last two years and I don’t understand why. 

We had an active sex life before. He normally was the one to initiate it. And now, I’m not sure what changed. This didn’t bother me too much until recently in the last few months when we’ve been sitting at home doing nothing and have all the time in the world for sex but we still don’t do it. I’ve tried multiple times and he hasn’t been up for it. 


So I got fed up and asked him about it. We are super open normally but I feel like I’m not getting a straight answer. The first time I asked why we haven’t, he said something like “I’m not sure, it hasn’t been good lately” he seem embarrassed. and then a few days later I asked again and he got more serious and said something along the lines of he hasn’t been performing well lately, even when he’s alone and to just give him some time. But... it’s been like this for two years now. He will do things like grab my boobs and butt randomly and kiss me goodnight but we lack any sort of passion. Our relationship is so great besides the sexual aspect of it. And truly, it doesn’t bother me that much, I would be fine with only having sex like once or twice a month. But the utter lack of sex upsets me and makes me feel like he’s unhappy for whatever reason. 

I’m not sure what to do. Any ideas on where his heads at?

Thanks in advance"
"Having Serious Trust Issues I have been dating this girl for about 2-3 months now. And during this time period, she has confessed to being in love with her ex (even though it has been 6 months since they broke up). She told me that she is trying to get over him, and after a month of us fighting she now says that she is completely over him. 

Recently, we had 2 fights that almost ended our relationship, and the root cause of those arguments were that I logged in her account and went through chats w her ex, second one being also linked to her account and her ex. Personally, I am not the kind of person to keep on checking on someone's text messages and stuff like that, but since we had exchanged accounts we basically signed up for this. Obviously, I would impulsively go through her ex's chat from time to time. I didn't mind her going through my text messages. 

After the most recent fight we had she took her accounts away and calls exchanging passwords extremely toxic as i cannot ""invade her privacy"" and need to ""respect her space."" Mind you, I have caught her flirting w her ex and leaving me on hold to talk to her ex but I never called her out on that. All the arguments we had related this were initiated by her.

Personally I think that all this ""i need my space BS"" is just BS and a definite red flag. She is probably ignoring me and talking to her ex and flirting with other guys or something. I just can't put my complete trust in her in such a situation. I want to know that am I wrong for feeling this way? If I can give her my accounts why cant she give me hers? If we are dating and supposedly  ""in love with eachother"" why cant i have access to her text messages? I suppose if she is my significant other, there needs to be complete transparency. I feel like I am just being used for sex at this point, I honestly don't care about sex at all. If it was about sex I could get other girls very easily. I am, unfortunately, emotionally involved. 

I dont REALLY see the need to hide your text messages in a relationship unless there is something going on. This is a red flag imo, i hope i am wrong though"
"How should I play this? A couple of questions So I, (24M) was texting a girl (23F). We got close over a dating app during quarantine. Everything was going fine, and then I started to notice the energy change. Texts farther and farther apart. Less response. Finally she tells me she doesn’t think she’s ready for anything . Per usual, the response starts, “You’re a nice guy..BUT” Then there’s always a reason that ends up being a load of crap. She said she wants to remain friends and maybe when all of quarantine clears up, we can hang out or possibly be more. Mind you, she is being the primary breadwinner in her house during the economic crisis here in the US. 

My question is two fold

1. Should I continue to be a nice guy, or should I insert a little more “asshole tendencies?”

2. Should I continue contact with her, or should I go just cut it off and let her contact me?"
"My brother (16~) is turning from a sweet kid to someone who is becoming toxic for both me and my mum. I don't know what to do and it's getting out of control. Times in quarantine are hard, and tensions are rising in my house as I'm sure they are in everyone else's. We had a huge argument because he seems to think that it's okay to cuss me out for no apparent reason and this happens a lot. I care a lot about him but he constantly puts both me and my mum down and doesn't contribute at all.  Yes some people become rebellious when they're a teenager but the way he talks and acts is just awful and has such a bad attitude problem. Some of the time he is fine but the rest is just horrible and it's really putting a strain on our family. He really seems and act like he is superior to everyone else. I can't even approach him about it because he doesn't take me seriously and isn't mature enough to listen to anyone if they try to confront him about his attitude. Any help would be appreciated, I don't know what to do about him anymore."
"Sandwich generation Fellow Hispanic here currently living with my parents and husband after graduating from grad school. If you know anything about our culture, it’s that there’s an invisible pressure and assumption I have to take care of my family while still building my own. 

My parents 100% took care of me through grad school yes, and I appreciate that whole heartedly. I’m planning on repaying them as much as I can, once my career takes off. However, as I live with them I have my mother telling me she resents me for getting married because my priority is now my husband and “it’s not fair to them.”  She’s gone as far as saying if she would’ve known I would’ve gotten married right after grad school they wouldn’t have helped me out. Then I’m forced to face my husband and pretend everything is ok because I don’t want to let him know what’s going on and make him feel uncomfortable. 

Gets me thinking, was I just an investment to them? Don’t parents want to want to help their children out of the goodness of their heart without ever expecting anything back?

Anyone with a familiar experience have any advice? As much as I want to move out with my husband and focus on our own family, I don’t want them to feel like I’m leaving them behind to dry. I’m currently helping them out financially, but not as much as I could because my career is still taking off. Not helping them has never been my intention, but I can only take so much before my mental health starts taking a toll."
"Advice needed please - Not sure if we are friends or more? I (20/F) am talking to my friend (22/M) and I don’t know what he thinks of me. I (20/F) have been talking to this guy (22/M) for about a month now and we became mates. We met in a shared class at Uni after we were partnered up together for a project. Since then we have texted each other pretty regularly and video chatted a few times. I am unsure where I stand with him though as I seem to get mixed signals. At times, he and I will have an easy-flowing text conversation back and forth. He compliments me a lot, uses a lot of emojis, and sometimes says cheeky remarks. I am unsure if he is flirting with me or if I am reading too far into our interactions? Can anyone explain how they know for sure that someone is flirting with them through text? But then there are also times where he does not respond to my text message for a few days and just seems distant. He did confess to me that he is going through a hard time right now, so that could be a part of the reasoning behind his actions. I am a bit concerned for him, but since we recently became friends I don’t wish to overstep my boundaries or come off as a hindrance. 

Due to his mixed signals, I just don’t know how to act towards him. How do I know if he thinks of me as a friend or more? Is there a sure fire way to know either way (without asking him because I do not feel comfortable doing that right now). It’s hard to judge behavior when the only interaction we have towards each other is online (because of the virus). 

Thank you for your input."
"Girlfriends mood swings affecting our relationship Hey Reddit,

It seems to happen a lot but when my girlfriend is at work she will tend to FaceTime me on her breaks for quick random I love you’s on FaceTime or just to see how I’m doing. This is great and I like it as long as it doesn’t interfere in her job. Now some days when I call her for quick hi how are you doings she will be happy and or she will be stressed to where she can be rude and a complete jerk to me where she treats me cold and emotionless. 

For example, today I FaceTimed her and she answered and I said hey baby how are you? And she just seemed pissed. And she said good. Then I asked if she’s coming over today and she said no I don’t want to and didn’t even say jk. And I said did you mean it or were you playing babe. She tells me she was jk. And I said so you are right? She said mmm yeah I guess. I don’t want to ask her is everything is okay because I feel like she will get mad. All I said was you are stressed at work honey? She said yeah I’m trying to do my work. So Reddit to me that’s Ok that’s fine and understandable but when I’m at work and she calls me I’m always kind and nice to her I don’t give her disrespect even if I am somewhat busy. And it honestly doesn’t feel like she wants to come today but she won’t say she doesn’t. 

It just seems like only when she’s feeling good and it’s convenient for her she will call me and treat me right. But when she calls me and I’m busy i still don’t treat her the way she does, I’ll just say hey baby I’m kinda busy but I’ll call you back when I’m free but I say all this in a good tone. She just seems to have such a cold tone towards me.

I don’t like this game of Russian roulette where I call her and I don’t know if I’ll get a happy person answering or just a pissed off one and it makes me feel like walking on egg shells. I’ve talked to her about it and she said she will change but nothing is ever done. I don’t like these random mood swings. Any advice?? Please"
"I (M 22) feel like shit today Today I (M) 22 feel like a piece of shit. I don’t know what it is. I don’t know if it’s just the whole Covid-19 situation. I’m trying to pinpoint what makes me feel so down today. My girlfriend is acting shady with me meaning that she was ignoring me yesterday and didn’t want to talk to me so I gave her space. Today is my mother’s birthday and I woke up early to get her a cake and flowers. I feel bad because I want her to feel a bit special. I’m Lowkey stressing over homework. I’m stressing about losing my job and trying to find another source of employment. I’m worried that I’m not a good role model for my younger siblings. I try to be here for them and my parents. At times my girlfriend makes me feel so bad about myself because I try my best to provide for my family. She will say things like ""wow I didn't know you had a wife and kids"" referring to my mother and siblings. My girlfriend thinks that I'm always lying to her and that I don't care about her but I truly do. I know why she feels like that though and it's my fault I had broken up with her before and I started to talk to another girl. Which caused her to not trust me. With the loss of my job, I worked for a support program at a university and my boss never cared for us as employees. I felt like I was not valued as an employee and especially now that only a ""certain"" of us got let go. I've been meeting with my therapist for a whole year now ever since my closes cousin passed away from a car accident he was drinking and driving. It really took a toll on me the passing of my cousin we were really close. In fact, he was one of my closes cousins out of my whole family. We grew up together .. we ate at the same table .... we both went through poverty... I know what it feels like being poor and struggling to eat the next day. I guess I'm just posting here to just put everything that I'm thinking about from my head onto here. I know that I have to have positive thoughts in order to be positive but today is just different. I try to have a routine and I try to go for runs in the morning and then force myself to do homework. 

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize in advance for jumping all over the place with my storyline."
"What can I do help save my long-term relationship? I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for 2 years. In all ways, he is an amazing boyfriend. Recently, I’ve noticed that I’m starting to get easily irritated with him and I no longer feel “sparks” like I once did. I’ve talked to him about it and he says that he’s here for me as I work through my feelings. I’m not exactly sure where these feelings came from but I’m starting to become unsure of compatibility as the initial honeymoon phase has worn off. I’ve committed myself to trying to make things work as I want this relationship to work. Is there anything I can do to try to save our relationship on my end without forcing it? And how long is an appropriate time to keep trying to make things work until it’s time to end it?"
"I (18F) wanted to move on but my ex (18M) keeps bothering me I (18F) wanted to move on but my ex (18M) keeps bothering me.

tl;dr // Been dating for 5 years (on n off) i'm always the one who ask to broke up because i'm a sensitive person, bf is a jerk sometimes but patient by trying to talk things through. He's also one of best friend which makes it hard for me to move on. I want to be friends but ex keeps contacting asking for closure. I lost count how many times i reject him. I really want to help him move on. // 

We've been dating for 5 years (but it's on and off). He live in different city because of college. It has been a year since we broke up. For me it's hard to move on because he's like one of my ""best friends"" that i have. Which makes it hard to move on. Keep in mind that I'm kind of anti social, so i don't have that many friends. Long story short, in the last couple of months he kept asking me to be his ""friend"". I've been trying to avoid his texts but he spams everywhere so i blocked him. Few weeks later he asked his friend to asked me if i could unblock him. And i tell my friends about this and they said that i shouldn't have block him in the first place because it's a coward thing to do. After that i unblock him and we started texting again. 

In one of many chats, he ask me to not ghost him and told me we could stay friends. He's always been a liar but i always fall for his tricks. Like that one time when i visit his house, i feel so uncomfortable because he kept touching me. I know it's a normal thing to do if you're dating someone, but it felt really uncomfortable. I try asking him not to, but he kept denying and doing whatever he wants. 

Fast forward to march. It's semester break. He plans on going to my home town and asked me if we could hang out. I just went along with it. We hung out twice. The first one we went out to eat and watch movie. When we watched the movie i noticed that he wasnt paying attention to it. He kept looking at me. It was really awkward but I somehow managed to ignore him. We went using his car. The car rides is definitely awkward. He keep trying to ask me ""how have you been, etc"". I get that he's trying to be polite, but i just wasn't in the mood to talk. This gets worst when he drives me home. He randomly ask me if he could hold my hand or not. I didn't realize that he take this as a date? I wholeheartedly told him that i wasn't interested, and he ""understood"". 

A week went by and he asked if we could hang out again. Coincidentally, i have to do a research for an assignment that i was working on. So i agree if he would help me with my research. At this point I'm not surprised anymore if he tries anything funny. I must admit that i did have a lot of fun hanging out with him. And then he just ruins it all by asking me for the hundredth time (im just exaggerating) he asked me to be his gf.

I hate to admit that i do missed him but i don't think i love him. The fact that *i* was always the one who ask to broke up and he's always been patient with me and trying to talk things out. Even though it hurts, I don't want to keep repeating the same cycle over and over again.

I really want him to be happy. I want to be his friend. I really do. But he always takes things the wrong way. The point is i want to help him move on. Should i leave him alone? Should i blocked him? 

Anyways, thank you for reading this mess. All of this is my recent memory of what happened. Any replies is greatly appreciated."
"My (20f) boss (47m) doesn't respect me as an adult Due to coronavirus I was transferred departments at my job so I could remain in work. I used to work in food now i work in janitorial. Immediately i noticed a difference, my new boss treats me with respect and kindness and understands i have bills to pay (i rent a room in my sisters house that she owns, this is important for later.) meanwhile my old boss always called me lazy, unimportant, and worst of all he treats me like a child who has not a care in the world. This is far from the truth. I work with my sister, when my sister cant make it in because she doesnt have a babysitter my old boss contacts my new one trying to cut my hours so i can go home and babysit so she can come in and he wont have to stay. My new boss tells him to buzz off but hes been persistent and when hes gone i have no choice but to leave. I feel very disrespected because i dont offer it, he doesnt talk to me about it, he just tells me this is how its going to be and this is what youre going to do. I tell him that im sorry and i cant afford to do that and he simply shrugs and says ""oh well"". Im wondering, can this be considered discrimination? Since ive told him i find it inappropriate multiple times and he still hasn't listened should i just go straight to HR or should i have another one on one talk? If we make it to phase two of reopening i will have to go back to my old boss and my new boss wont be able to protect me anymore"
"I'm worried about my relationship because of my career Hi, I started a relationship with my boyfriend last year, while we both were med students (first year). At the end of the semester he told me that he didn't like the career and he quit (this year he's studying to become a teacher, in the same university but a different campus).
Well , as the tittle says, I'm very worried about us in the future, because my career is getting more stressfull every semester that passes and it consumes a lot of my time, I see that people study all day and all night, and sometimes they barely eat . I'm afraid that he maybe won't like me anymore because I won't have time to see him or to ask how was his day (and all that stuff) although he told me that he understands. But we haven't seen if that works because of the quarentine.
I know that future is uncertain and the most important thing is to study, but I would be very sad if something happens to us , because he is like the perfect boyfriend and i don't want to loose him.
I have even thought of quitting the career too because of that and all the stress . But it could be also an effect of the quarentine. I've had anxiety attacks and I don't have motivation to study .
Should I see a therapist? 
I would be very thankfull if you advice me ! And It also would be helpfull if you are a med student and have a boyfriend like me,  but everyone is invited to give their advice!

"How do I deal with jealousy and insecurities in a long-term relationship? My (21F) boyfriend(28M) of 4 years has a lot of female friends. His best friend is his ex girlfriend. She’s married to a woman now, but I can’t help feeling jealous. I feel like I’ll always be second, even though logically I know it’s not true. I hate feeling this way. I know he cares about me, but I don’t know how to get over these feelings."
"I (f/32) caught my partner (m/42) sexting an ex-girlfriend on Facebook messenger and I don’t know what to do. Just what the title says. I saw some messages in his Facebook messenger when he left his messages open and there were new messages from someone named Sarah. I looked at the messages and they were having a conversation about all the old times they fucked. Talking about it in detail. Talking about sex dreams. Then to top it off, the end of the conversation was him saying “how it’s impossible not to cheat” and that even though he “has a hot girlfriend who is 10 years younger” he is still “questioning being loyal” and also “thinks a little cheating is healthy”. This ex girlfriend lives across the country, btw. 

I broke down. I think he is a piece of fucking garbage now. It’s like now I both love him and hate him at the same time. I hate that he had this conversation with someone. I don’t understand why he would say these things. We have been together for 1.5 years and have the most beautiful relationship (or so I thought). We were just talking about starting a family and buying a house, getting married, all of that. Now I just don’t know if I can trust him. How can I move forward with him after this? He said he did it for the “thrill” and because he liked the attention. I don’t understand this at all because I shower him with attention and dote on him constantly. We have *great* sex almost every day. 

I suck at words so I’m sorry if this comes off as rambling or whatever. I just really need help. I’m too ashamed to talk to any friends or family about it. He is trying to get us into couples counseling. I just want it to be over but I also don’t. I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice, kind words, sharing similar situations would help a lot. I just feel so angry, hurt, betrayed, and heartbroken."
"Am I being crazy? Basically I’m moving in with my gf to our new place and she wants to bring things that I knew her ex bought her such as furniture and electronics for general house use, for me I don’t want anything that will remind her of him in my home because I knew how much of a piece of shit he was."
"When is it acceptable to say 'i love you' to your friends? I see that a lot of good long term friends tell each other they love em . . Not like ""im in love with you"" but a ""I love you bro, you're a good friend""

"How do I make real friends? Throughout elementary school and junior high, I was bullied and excluded from everything. I was an outsider with two friends. I’m still friends with them today, too. I thought I had more but turned out all of them except the unnamed two were fake. 

Fast forward to today, May 8, 2020. Four years later. I changed schools and started making new friends, and around this time last year landed myself in a huge friend group. Around twenty or so friends. I’ve had a hunch that a couple of them didn’t like me, and I knew for a fact one of them absolutely hated me. However, it runs much deeper than that. While conversing with one of my friends, it turns out all of them, with the exception of him, and six others talk behind my back. They dread me hanging out with them. They dread me being in their group chats. They despise me, yet tell me I’m one of their best friends. They talk shit about me with each other behind my back. I suspected some of them, but not over half the group. This is now the second time I’ve run into this problem of having fake friends, fake relationships with people. Friends that told me they loved me, and they’ll miss me when I go off to college, yet talk shit about me behind my back. 

I don’t know how to confront them, or even if it’s worth it. I obviously have some good friends, but we’re all seniors and going our separate ways to college. None of us are going to be even remotely close, especially me since I’ll be moving halfway across the country. Thus the title, how do I make real friends?

I made these friends through football, the seven in high school I mean. The two from elementary and junior high, well we were bullied heavily and come together through experience trauma and we are still close. I don’t know how else to make friends though. I’m a very introverted person and keep to myself a huge majority of the time, and obviously I don’t know how to spot if a person is fake or not. Any and all advice is welcomed."
"My ex won't stop harrassing me to be friends and I don't want to Bear with me, its kind of a long story and I need some advice

Last year I broke up with my ex gf (i'm a girl too, just in case its relevant) , who I was in a long-distance relationship with for three years. Looking back, I had already been wanting to break up with her for a while, but tried to convince myself not to because I felt too bad. I just stopped having those feelings, and I wanted to see other people and be with someone who lived closer; it was no one's fault. There was no infidelity, no feelings for anyone else, I just wasn't in love anymore.

When I told her all this and said I didnt want to be in the relationship anymore, she couldn't understand it. She couldn't understand how my feelings could change and she basically wouldn't have it, so to speak. For the next three days she wouldn't stop texting be even though I said I needed her to stop and I needed space, and it got so bad I had to block her on all social media. My friends and therapist all agreed it was the best thing to do for my own state of mind, I couldn't stop crying out of guilt and having panic attacks and feeling I had broken her heart. I also felt I really wouldn't be able to move on otherwise.

After that, she still sent me e-mails, which I tried to respond for a while, because I felt too bad if I didn't at least answer her there. I even tried to stay friendly by answering every once in a while and trying to have a ""normal"" correspondance via mail but she would throw a fit if I didn't answer right away or for a few hours or a day, so in the end I just stopped opening my email account.

After a while, she calmed down, and I started dating and met someone else. I'm really happy with her. 
The thing is, somehow my ex found out I'm with someone else now, and said things like she can't believe im already with someone else, and now she keeps e-mailing me saying she really wants to talk by phone and doesn't see why we can't have a friendship and all she wants is to be friends. 

She also says that she's really hurt i've been ignoring her e-mails and that i've ruined her psyque and the least I could do is talk to her and things like that... Which make me feel terrible and guilty and honestly like the worst person on the planet, and makes me wonder if I really AM being terrible and unreasonable to have her blocked everywhere and ignore her... But the thing is, I really don't want to be friends, I don't see it being beneficial at all, but I just feel so bad and so full of guilt. Also I know if I did unblock her she will just start sending me messages nonstop. 

Also, my current gf is kind of the jealous type - not abnormally jealous, but I know she wouldn't be overjoyed if I had a close friendship with my ex, especially since she knows what my ex is like. Tbh I wouldn't be overjoyed if she was close friends with her ex either

What should I do? I really do feel awful but I feel like there's nothing I can do without making matters worse"
"Separate rooms but still sleeping together? (m/m, 19/21, 4 yrs) I very much love my boyfriend and we have now lived together for two years (dating for four) after i was kicked out of my parents house at 17. At my parent's house my privacy was never really respected and my room never felt like myown comfortable space due to feeling surveillanced(?) in everything i did and know they could and would just go through my stuff as they liked. When i moved in with my boyfriend after losing my home everything felt great but recently theres been strain. I still love him to the ends of the earth but i feel like if i am with him forever i will never in my life get to have a space that is just mine and time to be truly alone as we live in a small bedroom in a shared apartment. I realize i take massive control when it comes to furniture and decorating, possibly subconciously trying to make it ""my"" room rather than ours. I have been trying to think of a way to finally have a place of my own while not having to leave the relationship and thought about the possibility of when we move (in about three months) renting a two bedroom instead of a one bedroom and each having our own space but still being able to game together and cook together and hang out as much or as little as we want. We also highly value sleeping next to eachother and would still be able to do that everynight as we have a queen sized bed and futon so we could chose each night where to sleep. Is this unadvisable? Im still quite young and this feels smart but i would love advice on it all. I plan to go back to therapy once this virus is done to help with the strain im feeling as well but at the moment thought i would post here. Worst case scenario we have an extra room to setup our pets (a bird and two guineas) in. Ask any questions you want!  
 
 ((tl;dr- i feel like i wont be able to have my own space and am considering living in a separate room as my partnef but still sleeping in the same bed)"
"Breaking up with someone I love dearly (?) Background:
Together for almost a year. I think she is by far the best match of all my relationships so far in terms of personality and interrsts. The sex and communication is amazing, too. I feel she really puts effort in our relationship. I'm 30 and I never met anyone like her. I doubt Ill meet someone this good for me again/soon.

That said Im dreading our future together. All i want is to grow old with someone (preferably her), build a strong relationship and a family. she however doesnt want kids. Ive made it clear I find it important and shes warmed up to the idea of adoption. Adoption takes easily 7 years here but mostly I have a biological urge to make my own offspring. I know its rrational but no matter how I try I cant shake that idea from my head. The urge is something I can no longer deny. I havent told her this yet.

She is unwilling to give natural birth (for valid reasons).

Im just struggling really hard because I dont want to break up with her. I care for her deeply and Im madly in love. It hurts me however to think of our future. Shes also depressed which makes it more difficult to think of potentially breaking up with her. i know her mental state shouldnt come into the equation when speakig of my personal long term goals but I cant get myself to hurt her like that.

I dont know what to do and I dont know what Im even expecting here. Maybe Im just ranting. Sometimes I feel deeply unhappy in a relationship despite my partner being near perfect."
we've broken up to get back together after we graduate So my girlfriend(16) and I(16) have been in a great steady relationship but her parents hate me or rather dislike her having a boyfriend. We’re really happy with each other and we’ve been together for 6 months. But her older brother(22) told her that it’s better that we break up because they don’t like me and because of that they act cruel to her. She’s had a lot of family issues and this isn’t the first time they’ve broken her up with one of her boyfriends but since her brother urged her too she wanted to take break up with me for 10 months which is when we graduate high school and then we can get back together. But it feels like shit right now. The only reason I agreed to it is because it would be selfish if me to say no and its better if she gets along with her family instead of adding more strain to the already bad relationship with her parents. I just wanted to know whether it was a good choice and your thoughts on this situation.
"My ex makes me feel paranoid My ex and I rebound with each other and it lasted for a very few months. I broke up with him cause to start off I wasn’t over my ex (which he knew I wasn’t at all since the beginning), and lastly he was very immature, mentally, verbally and physically abusive, etc. Basically not the best person to be around. 

I tried to break up with him multiple times and just leave it as ‘we can just be friends’ and he would act understanding and that it was okay but he would always end up snapping, punching something or yelling at me and gaslighting me. 

I know I’m stupid for this but we hung out 3 times after the break up because I thought we could be somewhat friends. But boy was I wrong cause it would always end up in him forcing me to do things I didn’t want to do (kissing, hugging, hold hands), which I know is very stupid of me to have done those but he would get very upset if I didn’t do either of those things; and I was just so scared of what he would’ve done. 

I was fed up so I ended up just texting him to come pick up his thing and telling him the same I told him in person when I tried to break up with him. Which he respond with I thought this was just a break and then he snapped and he said many, MANY hurtful things and tried to manipulate me. 

He showed up saying says let’s make out, I said no give me my things and he said fine then let’s just talk, I told him there’s nothing to talk about and he got mad grabbed my wrist hard and told me to get in the car. I somehow managed to get him to let go. I got my things he yelled at me and as I was walking away he punched his steering wheel and said fuck you and almost hit me with his car. 

He texted me multiple paragraphs saying many hurtful things. So I ended up blocking him on everything, but he would somehow find a way to contact me through anything. He keeps begging me to take him back, saying I’m sorry how I reacted that day, let’s pretend I didn’t go crazy, I’m gonna change, etc. And he ends up getting very mad cause I won’t take him back. 

I’ve gotten multiple messages from him for a whole week. I’ve tried re-explaining it to him why but he’s not taking no for an answer so I just don’t even bother responding and just end up blocking him every single time. 

I feel like he’s gonna end up coming to my house soon. And just the thought of that gives me bad anxiety throughout the day and night. I sometimes can’t even go to sleep cause I’m so paranoid of him"
"I recently got back in touch with an old frenemy and my parents aren't impressed I'm in my mid 20s now, but I had this friend in my childhood, we'll call her Jackie. We were best friends from when we were little kids up until high school, and I have a lot of wholesome memories with her, but she always had a bit of a mean/bullying streak. Things got a lot worse when we reached our teen years, and I remember frequently being miserable because of things she'd said or done, and my parents grew to really dislike her. Eventually I found a new group of friends and distanced myself from her, and she found new friends. There was never a big confrontation, but the ""friendship"" fell apart and we went our separate ways.

Now, we are both in our 20s, and she seems to have grown up a lot. I know she had a bad home life as a kid, and she's moved away from that now, and seems genuinely happy, with a successful business. I recently commented on one of her social media posts from her business, and she reached out and we've been catching up, and its kind of sweet - she's not being rude or mean, and it seems like she really just wants to talk.

I told my parents about it and they were genuinely mad at me - they think I'm being naive, and that people don't change. I disagree, and regardless, I don't feel like she has any power over me now. In high school, I was sensitive and vulnerable, and I took everything she said or did very personally. Now, I'm an adult, I have no tolerance for bullsh\*t, and I don't see what she could realistically do to hurt me - its not even like I'm planning on being besties again.  High school is high school - it brings out the worst in everyone, and I don't want to hold onto grudges any more. And if she did start any crap, I'd just block her and move on.

So what do you think? Am I being naive? Is it a stupid decision to catch up with her? I'm not planning on sharing any deep personal info. 

Thanks in advance!"
"Does the fact that I feel uncomfortable with the girl I'm seeing posting sexually suggestive pictures on Instagram make me insecure? I made this post yesterday, about how the girl (21F) that I'm (20M) seeing sometimes posts sexually suggestive pictures onto Instagram and I don't feel comfortable with it:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/gfb6px/is\_it\_normal\_that\_i\_20m\_feel\_uncomfortable\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gfb6px/is_it_normal_that_i_20m_feel_uncomfortable_with/)

&amp;#x200B;

And after reading the comments and talking to people, some people have said that I must be insecure to not feel comfortable with it. I'm not sure if I'm insecure, maybe a bit. Does the fact that I'm uncomfortable make me insecure?"
"Best way to tell my bf to shape up or get tf out? So my bf (19M) and I (20F) have been dating for almost 8 months. I love him, but I’m sick of the way our relationship is. 

&amp;#x200B;

He’s very self-centered in the bedroom and our sex almost always revolves around what he wants done to him. He’ll do things he knows will turn me on then deny me sex because “I’ve already gotten him off and it’ll hurt if he gets hard again.” Most of the time I come to him for sex he turns me down because he doesn’t feel like it but sometimes gets upset when I try to turn him down. To the point I don’t because I don’t want to listen to him complain about it.

He refuses to try out any of the things I’m interested in (BDSM) because it all comes off as ‘abusive’ to him but wants me to continue doing all the things he likes even though he’s aware some of it I really hate and outright hurts me to do. The only time he ever tried something I liked (handcuffs in this case) was when I was strongly telling him no to sex. He said and did things he knew would turn me on, handcuffed me to the bed and kept teasing me until I caved.

I’m mostly a non-verbal girl so speaking is difficult for me, and he mostly fills in the conversations. I’m cool with that and have been trying to voice my opinions and interests more (per his request, which I totally get) but whenever I do I feel like he just switches it back to whatever it was he was or wanting to talk about so I feel like I get mixed signals whenever I try to speak up so I just go back to responding to what he says and mostly keeping quiet.

I asked him once to write me a ‘letter’ just because I really needed to hear that he loved me and he told me he wasn’t good at that sort of thing and refused. He supposedly feels really guilty for some of the shit he’s done and vented about his guilt to a friend of mine but it hurts that she gets to hear it but I don’t. I want to know he feels bad about it, not hear that he told her how badly he feels.

I’ve given him lots of room, second chances, and the patience of a saint. I’m ready to tell him to shape up or I’m leaving. What’s the best way to do that without any uncertain terms?"
"My (36f) fiance (40m) wants his nephew (15m) to come stay with us Fiance has been talking to his nephew and I guess he's not getting along with his step dad and step brother and he wants to come stay with us for a while. 

Fiance says he sounds miserable and is practically begging to come stay with us and on one hand I do feel bad for him. But on the other hand, everybody is miserable and having a hard time right now. We all just have to deal with it. We're having a hard enough time locked in the house 24/7 (I got laid off, daughter is finishing up school from home, fiance is working from home).

He swears he'll be on his best behavior and quarantine in the guest room for as long as we want him to but I'm not sure how long that good behavior would last. 

Every time I've met him he's been all attitude which I can kind of understand. He's a teenager full of hormones and he hasn't had the easiest childhood. That doesn't mean I want to br locked in a house with him. Plus he already has a history with getting into trouble with the cops and I don't trust that I won't have to worry about him getting in trouble. 

Fiance and my daughter (15f) both say I'm being unreasonable but I feel like this is an awful idea and I'm the only sane one. Am I being unreasonable? 

It's really starting to put a strain on my fiance and my's relationship. He's basically accusing me of forcing him to abandon his family. I just don't see this going any way but horrible. Any advice or input is greatly appreciated



Tldr- fiance wants his trouble maker nephew to come quarantine with us"
"My [24F] boyfriend [28M] hooked up with his best friend’s wife and it makes me uncomfortable My boyfriend hooked up with his best friend’s wife a couple times back when they were in college. The three of them are completely fine with it now and hang out, but I’m nervous about hanging out with them because it makes me uncomfortable. 

My boyfriend means the world to me and I know he’s the one. He completely understands how I feel and wants to help me feel okay, but it is important to him that I one day feel comfortable enough to be around them because his best friend is like a brother to him. 

I’m not really sure what to do. I want to feel comfortable and know this happened years ago and meant nothing. My boyfriend’s relationship with her now is 100% platonic and he’s never made me feel like I wasn’t the most important thing to him. I know this is a me problem...how can I overcome it?

Thank you all."
"My friends don't care about me in quarantine and I'm miserable Hello everyone,

I know for some of you this might be a really superficial problem, since many have been dealing with more serious issues, but I am really sad.

Last semester I spent a semester abroad, in a dorm filled with other international students. 

I already had some friends at home where I live, and they are great people, but I never really felt that deep, heartfelt connection with a group of friends until I studied abroad. There were people from different nationalities, languages and backgrounds, but somehow we made it work perfectly. We could all perfectly understand each other at first glance, we would joke and laugh all the time, we would eat together breakfast, lunch, and dinner and would stay awake drinking wine or even just tea until three in the morning, talking about ourselves and about life. Sharing thoughts, sometimes comforting each other, but mostly we would just lay there, talking about anything and everything, and we would perfectly understand each other, all the damn time. We would eat together and cook together and buy food together, study together, we would do everything together. All of us. If one needed a hand in anything, someone else was there, ready to help.

It was one of the best, happiest periods in my life. I hadn't felt that happy since I was around 10. For a few months, I felt in heaven, so happy, so high, so drunk on life all the time. It was exactly like a dream.

This group of friends that I had really felt almost as if I had found not one, but many soulmates. It was the best feeling ever, this months that I spent in the dorms will always be amongst the happiest in my life, even if we didn't do anything particularly special. It was never the same with the other friends I have.

Then, I was supposed to spend another semester (this current semester) abroad, in the same dorm with all of them. But when the previous semester ended, I came home in my country, with the intention of spending a couple of weeks here and then go back to the dorm. Too bad that the virus hit, everything was put under lockdown, my plane was canceled and my semester abroad was canceled as well. And that's how the amazing dream that I had been having for months shuttered. I'm nearly crying as I'm typing this.

I couldn't go back, even though the dorm stays open for the many students who have nowhere else to go. I informed my friends, and I thought they would call, they would tell me how sad they are about it, and that we will figure something out together. I thought that they would be as sad as I am, but they were not. I received a couple of texts, from four people, saying things such as: ""I'm sorry you can't come back. It really sucks"" or things along those lines. Only one or two people have asked how I am doing, but I think it was mostly out of politness than out of real care. And I hurt so badly for them. I cried for an entire week after my semester abroad was canceled. Even now, that it's been over two months that I'm back and I don't see them, I can't make peace with it. I am so sad, also because of the fact that I will never see them again all together. They are all from different countries so it's nearly impossible.

But as I said, they don't seem as sad as me. The one I considered one of my best friends within he group has not even texted me once. A couple of people told me they're sorry and when I replied with a really long text they didn't get me back. A couple other people, I text them sometimes, but they seem to not really care: I'm the one always initiating a conversation, and they just reply, sometimes even after a few days. I try to facetime them and they don't pick up. Only one of them has picked up once when I wanted to wish her a happy birthday but that's it. I asked to skype or facetime but they never seem to have a moment of free time to do it. It's as if they have completely erased me. I see their Instagram posts and stories and it hurts me even more. I am a little jealous of course, as they got to stay and I didn't, but mostly I'm hurt because I thought they were the friends of a lifetime and that we would always love each other and somehow manage to stay together.

On their instagram stories they have all subsituted me. The things I did before, now someone else does them. For example, one of the things that hurt me the most, is that one of those friends would always call me ""My shoulder"", as someone who supports her. And it was only for me. Now I saw on Instagram that she is calling someone else ""her shoulder"". I would always make them flower crowns, pizza and I would ride them around on shopping-carts. It was my thing. Now I see on Instagram that they've found someone else to do all of this; as if I was very easily replaceable.

And I care so much, and I wish so much that I was there.... Feeling so hurt by people and wishing so badly to be with them, just to have your heart shuttered when you find out they don't feel the same about you at all. Is this what heartbreak feels like? I guess so, since I never had a boyfriend. But I think this is like heartbreak but amplified, since many people were involved, and I love them all so much. Finding out they don't love me, not in the same way I do, really hurt me. In more than two months I've only sparsely heard from four people (even when I tried to contact the others, they did not get back to me). And I thought they were the best people I met in my life, that we would stay together, as friends, forever.

Now I don't know what to do. I could deal being here in my house before meeting them, because I didn't really know what happiness felt like. Now that I've experienced real happiness in this past semester, I feel like I cannot live in a place where I'm unhappy anymore. But at the same time, that deep happiness that I felt back then, it now somehow seems like an illusion.

I want to be as happy as I was when I was there...

I don't know what to do or what to think about this. Any thoughts?"
"Found out fiancé (23f) talks about my (25m) penis size in group chat!? Tldr bullet form since livid

*Wife’s phone dies so I send it in to local Apple store (they take mail orders and drop offs)

*she’s out jogging when it’s delivered back to us, I open the box to make sure it’s functional

*somehow her password lock is disabled with factory reset, despite some convos being there (I guess last backup)

*I fall to temptation and snoop a little (know it’s wrong, but was too curious) and end up reading a “girl chat”, in which sex was recently discussed. After scrolling up again I read something to the affect of “yeah, (my name) is on the smaller side, and it limits positions”

*this obviously makes me really insecure, especially since she brought it up with one of my friend’s gf. It’s been a few days and my sexual confidence is really low, I’ve been able to get away with it by saying I’m feeling a bit sick, but not sure if I can last"
"Red flags? Throwaway.

Husband (30m) and I (29f) haven't been intimate in months. The last time I felt as though he were just going through the motions to get me to shut up about it. He deals with work and finances, I handle kids and home. We have our issues, but honestly it feels as though his mind and heart have been elsewhere. We don't talk, we apologize if we touch by mistake, ""I love you""s seem forced. . .I hate this. All of it. Even when he is home, he's ""elsewhere"". I try to talk, but I feel as though he's already checked-out of this ordeal.

I noticed a couple of weeks ago that he's been pulling large sums of money out of our joint account.  It doesn't end up in savings, and when confronted he said he just likes having cash on hand. A couple thousand dollars' worth? Okay.

I signed a check for him to deposit later today, and put it in his wallet to make things easier for him later today. I swear I didn't mean to snoop, but there were several folded papers inside that had my signature on the backs of them. I opened them up, and apparently they're checks that his father had given me for my birthday and christmas (months ago) but I had never seen them before. *They had my signature on them*. Is this the first/only time this has happened? I can't be sure. Maybe he just forgot about them and forged my signature to get them cashed, or maybe I had signed them before, thinking they were for something else. But I never knew his dad had been gifting me, we've been on shaky ground since I married his son, so it would've been nice to know he thought about me I guess.

Alongside the checks was a receipt for some kind of work function, in which he had paid for 2 $20 tickets a couple of months ago. He never told me about the function. I checked my calendar on my phone, and that happens to be one of the very many weekends that he's been made to go into work. He didn't mention a function on that day, though while scrolling the company's page I found that it was some kind of formal luncheon with games and stuff. There are many pictures of him having the time of his life with his coworkers. I wasn't invited, but the receipt distinctly shows he paid for two tickets.

Maybe he's excluding me because I'm so high strung these days, stuck at home with the kids. Maybe nothing is going on/wrong. Maybe I'm thinking/looking too much into this. Maybe I'm jealous of the time he's spending with work stuff, when he should be focused on our home. Maybe I'm just bitter.

But I can't shake this all-too-familiar feeling that I'm being given the run-around. I'm easily gaslighted b.c I'm too trusting. I don't think I can shake this feeling anymore.

Any third-party perspectives, please??? Am I over reacting?"
"My dad (46m) is about to cheat on my mom (42f). My mom had an emergency to tend to with my grandma so my dad and I are alone. My dad is 100% in on visiting a friend. It’s just me and him and he told me he’s going to leave today and come back sometime next week. He’s cheated before but he’s been clean for a good 8 years. After a lot of fights and arguments my mom forgave him on the premise that he wouldn’t do it again. Like all cheaters say, he promised my mom he wouldn’t cheat again. 

I feel like I can’t do anything to stop it. And I know for certain he is cheating because I know of all his past infidelities. He always used to tell me about them. All of his brothers and his father have cheated at least once. (Even I’ve cheated on girlfriends but I’m in a serious relationship going on 4 years and I know I could never hurt this woman) They all seem to not care that they’re doing it to their wives which I’ve come to realize is super horrible. 

I feel guilty knowing about this and I don’t want to tell my mom. I’d rather stop him from going through with his plans but I seriously don’t think I’m going to be able to. I also have no one to turn to because either they’re going to laugh it off or they’ll tell my mom themselves. I really don’t want my parents to divorce or any of that so I don’t know what to do. 

This is why I turn to you guys. I need some solid advice from some people I have no emotional connections with. Please help me out. (24m)"
"My Covid real life drama My story is not so complicated but I dont know where to start. 
Anyway, I have a bf, for 8 years and we have two young children that we dearly love. I can say he was a nice guy sometimes but jerk and selfish. When I first met him Ive seen red flags that I should run away but I was young and confused and I didnt have a lot of experience when it comes to relationship plus different culture so I felt confused. First thing I noticed he likes multiple women by flirting online and pressure me to meet/date other girls and have 3some with him or even triad relationship. I didnt have any issue with it at first because I am open minded and I am not a bad looking if I approach a girl I always get yes. We had tried and did that stuff but what i dont understand is my bf he wants a relationship with another girl and then me. I am open enough to have some fun but not a relationship. I find it weird and now that we have kids i dont wanna expose them to that having another girl that my bf is intimate with. Anyway, years passed he didnt have a job or income he was depressed and his porn and flirting with girls online addiction became bad. He would chat and talk to those his imaginary gf more than he interact with me. The first year was the best year of our relationship. After that we started to have issues we would be arguing non stop and me questioning everything he does because it doesnt make sense
He doesnt work he stays athome 7 days a week infront of his computer. While I worked with two jobs and making sure put food on the table and provide my kids what they need. I was physically exhausted, mentally and emotionally. So, after 8 years big break came he got a good job offer executive possition ofcourse he took it and i am very happy for him. I told myself this is maybe a sign that we could give our relationship one more chance. The company relocate him and i followed him after 3 months. I flew alone with my two kids while the pandemic is going on we landed and we were few hours away from shutting everthing down but we made it. 

We landed bf, picked us up kids were very happy to see thier dad. The next day I found out he is broke spent his paycheque for nonesense so i had to lend him 3k$ he didnt even have any money to put gas on his rental. I was furious  because nothing change i am dealing with his same BS. I asked him a queation, "" you knew we are coming, why did you spent all your money?"" I flew with my kids and i made sure i have money and everything i can take care of them like i always do. 

I let this issue go, he paid me back as soon as he recieved his paycbeque. But for the 8 years he is jobless je owes me a lot of $$$. 

Next thing, we moved to 3 bedrooms house and he brought his side chick in the same roof. He said she is the house keeper/his personal assistant he also bang. I am aware of it nothing I can do now he makes money he makes decision i dont like it i am welcome to leave but its pandemic no where to go and i am in a foreign country but my concern is the pandemic. I think about my children if were just me ill pack my bag and leave. With all the BS of 8 years I am numb, im not scared or affraid and i know i am capable to support my kids and myself i did it for 8 years plus suppporting him. 

So, this girl lasted 3 weeks and the whole 3 weeks was weird. I felt pity about myself because he always makes me feel i was and still never enough for him it affected my self esteem. For the last 3 weeks we argue and fight because he wont get rid of this girl. My son(3 old) came to me and complain this girl hit him but he ignore me and calls me cunt and crazy.  So, one day i caught her being mean and pushed my son in the pool and watched him drownimg for 2 seconds because as soon as i saw the whole thing i ran fast to rescued my son. My son was upset and crying. I comfronted him i told him her or me and the kids. Then be get rid of her after 2 hours of her gone. House was quite and calm and my kids are happier. He mentioned ber name and wanted to ask her something and when he said that i lost my cool and told him he is a piece of shit and gathered my stuff and i am going to leave him with my kids. After all what she did he still thought of contacting her?? I told him have some pride for your son its not all about your dick. That's when we got into a physical fight he beat me, smack me, bruise my legs, arms and my finger was bleeding. My face and head pushed and pounded on the floor plenty of times etc. 

After that fight, ive lost all my feelings for him. I decided ill shut my mouth and take care my kids do what i have to do daily.

I am waiting for covid to go away amd as soon as i can book a flight. I will fly with my kids back to North America. 

It's been 2 weeks now since that fight and i feel akward being in the same roof with him. I only talk to him strictly necessity. When i do i noticed that barely no word come out from my mouth and i barely hear my voice i think this is a sign of exhaustion and i gave up on him.
I feel like he still doesnt get over loosing her. Feel like he is heart broken because he said she was perfect for him that does everything he wants. 
At this point I dont care what he does i just dont wanna be part of it. I do know i deserve better. 

It is very frustrating to be in the same roof with him.

Everyday, i feel more and more fall out of love of him.
One thing i know he is not gonna make  it easier to let me go. He is holding me hostage so he could run to me when no women pays attention to him or when he is $$ broke.

I never understood myself of why i let anyone like him treated me like this. All i did was work hard and stood by his side. Now we have children it makes it hader to  break up. I can leave but he is my childrens dad and i am stuck i knew he would always bother me.

I was and still willing to co-parent with him. I wont take the children away from him. If he wants to be part of the childrens life then its great! But he is selfish he wants to hold me hostage. But i cant forgive him for all he did to me. All this was just small details of my relationship with him.

Some people are born and mentally selfish as illness no cure.."
"My ex bf cheated on me while we still together and his current gf just told me everything today and now i can't sleep So we date not long only 2 months since March-beginning of May 2019 as a boyfriendgf and I told him to broke up. After 1 week of broke up I texted him and we hang out and had sex sometime. But then he will disepare and come back.. and i wont bother as we dont date anymore. I found out today that he dated other girl on July ( when we still met and had sex sometime) and i found out I had HVP on this month too ( and i dunno how did I get that in that time  ) and now i know 

However he didnt tell me if he see anyone and he  really play so clean as I was stupid didn't know that. 
Still met from july until last time is in the middle of January 2020 ( and had sex a few times in between) as we still talk on and off until now but didn't meet cause i always refused.. He will always nagging me to come over and demand sex all time. 
I still see him as a good friend , help me sometime and he sounds honest and always demand honesty but I can't believe he actually cheat behind my back with 2 girls. 

Even last Friday he still asked me to meet n come over to his place.. now i know why he never asked me out even only go for walk n only his house It just because he is scare if anyone know that he cheat on me.

This morning I saw he blocked me on whatsapp and I'm confused.
Suddenly this evening his current gf text me and said that they both in love and happy and he did actually cheat on me for long time even after broke up. Me and his current gf talked and feel sorry for each other.. The current gf just found out last night too from his phone.
BUT GOD I NEVER THINK HE WILL DID THIS TO ME. HE SEEMS LIKE NICE AND HONEST AS HE ALWAYS DEMAND ME TO BE HONEST. IT'S REALLY 1 YEAR AND I'M JUST IDIOT

The fact I don't care he cheat and date other but.. HPV that i have now it cause of him and he suppose to just honest disclose and didn't put me in this big Dark feeling and risk my health. Now he blocked me in whatsapp and number.. Surprisingly he didnt block for normal message but he didnt reply my text anyway.
I dont think i will trust anyone anymore or be in relationship as I had been cheat twice and i have very big trust issue. 

Beside whatever happen i just want to get check for STD and any sexual tramission if I'm clean i dont give a fuck with him anymore.. But i just cant forgive about HPV and being betrayed

Please anyone make me feel better :( as I have been depressed before and i have bad anxiety i dont want this thing make me down again and depressed. Thank you

TL;DR: my ex bf cheat on me as and made me have HVP and i dunno what to do now as I can't stop think about it"
"I need some help with maintaining no contact following the end of a nearly 5 year relationship. I’m a 29 year old female and have recently been humiliated and betrayed in a pretty spectacular way. The old me would have left and never looked back but this was an extremely narcissistic relationship and after being isolated from family and friends I definitely ended up co-dependent. It’s over, I get it and accept and am glad. My issue is that he (32m) is all I’ve known and after 8 weeks of back and forth ghosting I am now entirely alone and hundreds of miles away from anyone I know in the middle of a pandemic. I am desperate for no contact to work because it’s a classic cycle he uses of love bombing/ghosting to keep me intoxicated and terrified. I would usually turn to a therapist but it’s difficult at the moment and I know that if I don’t find the strength I am going to end up begging him and he doesn’t want me and I’m honestly the lowest I’ve ever been. I know the basics and he’s blocked and deleted but the pain of knowing all it would take to see him/speak to him again is to reverse that, is indescribable. Please help me 😔"

"I almost fought my girlfriend's ex and I'm not sure how I feel about our relationship anymore. My current girlfriend and I have been dating for a couple months now, but have been friends for 2 years and FWB for 6 months before we started dating. While we were friends, I helped her with her dating life and she helped me with mine. I also helped her get out of an abusive relationship.

Anyway, while we were FWB, she developed feelings for me (and I did too, but I didn’t want to try a relationship with a girl who I had a lot of mutual friends with). During this time, we had casual partners but we were also there for each other (emotionally and physically). She asked me out, and I said no at first (out of fear) but then I asked her out and she said yes. One day after I asked her out, I had a birthday party in my university dorm with some friends. I had to leave my party for a bit to help a friend out, and I found my current gf downstairs talking to one of the guys she had been on a couple of dates and had been fuck buddies with .

Some background: they met on tinder and I helped her get with him. Before we were together, they had some crazy sex and he came inside her and raw dogged her a couple times. (Side note: I don’t want to sound arrogant, so call me out if I should try to restructure my brain on this, but I’m not happy that she let this guy cum inside her within the first few times they hung out, even tho it happened before we were together. It also kinda hurts that I helped her with him in the first place.)

Back to the story: When I went downstairs, they were holding hands, and she told me later that she was trying to make him leave bc he was drunk and picking fights, and that was the only way she could get him to leave the dorm house. I saw this and I got pissed off (one day after our first date, she’s holding hands with a guy she used to fuck and left my birthday party without even telling me a thing). He saw me and  wanted to fight because she told him she was with me now. I was also drunk and pissed off, so we had to get separated by people but no punches were thrown. I was held back by some friends and he was held back by my current gf!!

I went back to my room and after the party was over, she came to talk. I was upset that she was on his side during the fight and told her I didn't want to talk to her until I had the chance to think things through. I wasn't happy with how that turned out but things got worse. Fast forward to two weeks ago, she tells me she still texts and sends memes to this guy. She said that he told her he wanted them to be on friendly terms after they stopped seeing each other and she was just honoring his request so things didn't become awkward. I felt betrayed. First she left my birthday party to meet with this guy who used to fuck her raw, and now she’s saying she wants to be on friendly terms with him? Am I overreacting?

She's a great person but I think we have different approaches to some important things, like how to treat ex-partners and how to communicate with each other. This is my first real relationship and although I wouldn’t say I love her, she means a lot to me. I haven't brought this up with her bc I don't want to make her feel guilty for something if it turns out that I am, infact, overreacting.

What would y’all have done in this situation? Do I bring this up with her or suck it up? Am I a dick for reacting the way I did?"
Walking away from a arguing partner Im not very good at arguing i tend to say things that dont make sense or just make the other person confused so i tend to just walk away and collect my thoughts. Ive always utilized the “silence is always a option” card but i do listen to what they say im just not good at responding. Is this a good way to counter a argument from my girlfriend or my mom maybe a friend? I hate yelling but when i do yell its hard for me to stop and i dont want to hurt anyone does anyone have any advice on maybe a better method? Please and thank you.
I feel like my girlfriend is a cheater My girlfriend as two kids by another man.. he constantly comes around her house to see other people n friends.. sometimes he sit outside her house just because.. She see’s no problem with that she say they’re grown people can hang out with who they want to.. ok cool I agree.. but today he called her and told her he was gonna get her something for Mother’s Day.. that’s not a problem either.. but he called back n asked where her where your boyfriend at which is me n I was right there.. so she had to say I was right there.. so I feel he adjusted but still later said I can’t have nun of the gift it’s just for u.. and she said ok.. n hung up.. I feel insecure to even go to work now.. I feel super insecure about this situation...
"Can’t deal with bf family anymore, feeling miserable Needed to rant so here it goes..
I just cant stand my bf family. We have love-hate relationship. Especially with his mother. One day everything could be fine, she is happy, everyone is happy. The next day she cant stand my presence and wants me out. I respect her “laws” but sometimes they are out of norm. She has a pet peeve- no gf in our house in workdays. Even now, when in quarantine, im all alone in my house, because my family drove to our country house and left me in the city. She doesn’t want me to be there with them on “workdays”. And the absurdity of this is the reason - my laugh, its to loud. WHAT THE ACTUAL F ... ?
You would say that we need to talk this through. But the thing is she doesnt speak with me. Its always small talk, because “she doesnt feel the need to talk with me and i dont put the effort so what is the point “ . Thats what she said to my bf. If he asks her if she has a problem with me , she says no, but i just have this feeling in my gut that there obviously is something wrong. 
We are together for 2 years now and throughout all this time there has been multiple sarcastic comments from her. That we have “pink glasses” and dont see clearly. And she still thinks that. She even made comments about my eating. She jokes about how little i eat, but i have been struggling with ED throughout my teen years. I dont have the need to justify this to her, but in general - JUST DONT MAKE JOKES ABOUT EATING!!
At this point i just dont want to go to his home, because i feel ashamed for my eating habits, i feel attacked for wanting to freely enjoy my time with bf and LAUGH if i want to. 
Bf sees the problem but he is scared to talk with his mom, because of her opinion and attitude towards him and us in general. He is scared to hurt her but he doesnt see the whole picture - his family is really hurting me and him with this toxic attitude. And yes, to answer the question - i am his first gf, but it has beed TWO YEARS. 
If there is the fear of losing the oldest son - get over it, its not my fault. 
I just dont know how to cope with this anymore."
"My (22f) boyfriend (30m) watches adult films without me and I don’t know how to get over it. So, for starters I have had low self esteem most of our relationship. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. However, we’ve known each other for almost 5 years. I have a rocky relationship with porn and am trying to come to terms with it. But, I feel as if I’m not wanted or desirable because of him watching it. He says that since we have sex so often (we have sex every week, but we typically only see each other on weekends) he hasn’t been doing it as much. However, this past week I was over everyday and yet he still did it when I left for work. He has photos of me and I’ve asked if he uses them and he’s said no. So I’ve suggested taking new ones and he doesn’t seem interested. I’ve suggested taking videos of us, because I could also use them and he shoots down the idea every time. I don’t know how to feel secure that I’m enough for him and that using porn is normal in a relationship. How do I move on from this without ruining my relationship?"
"I'm really hurt by my boyfriend innocently bringing up his ex and feel like he ruined my birthday. Need advice on how to feel better and get over my insecurity So my bf and I have been dating for almost a year. Before that he dated his ex for around 6 years on and off and I dated my ex for around 3 years. 

Before my bf I dated 2 other guys and I was always the more serious relationship they've ever had. I'm having a hard time dating someone with such a history. I understand it's silly and insecure of me, but I can't really change how I feel. It hurts to sometimes think of how they had more than we do just through the sheer amount of time they had together. My boyfriend is also very set on never comparing people because he thinks it's unhealthy and feeds into insecurity which I agree with but it does make me feel very not special. He'll say it often that I'm so special and amazing but when I ask why am I special he just says because I am. To me it feels like I'm the current girl he's seeing so in his mind that makes me special, but in my mind if me and 4 other girls before me have all been special...well you get it. I try to move past this because I understand it's my insecurity speaking, but it does hurt sometimes.

Well my birthday is coming up in a week and I told him it's funny that I know so many people born in the same month as me and very little in other months. He said he also knows many people born in this month and told me about them. Among them are his mom and his ex. I just feel like I didn't want to know that. I don't want to associate my birthday with her, but now it's going to happen. Now when I think of it I think of him talking to her, wishing her a happy birthday and whatnot because he still texts her on special occasions. I feel so dumb but I can't help it. It's been a week and I've tried distracting myself and whatnot but every time he brings up my birthday now I just feel like 'oh great, around the time you text your ex'.

I know I'm out of the line and should get my shit together, but I don't know how to. I'm feeling really hurt. Any advice would be really appreciated."
"how would a female coworker feel if a male coworker she gets along with came up behind her and put his arms around her and whispered, ""you're so pretty?  

# how would a female coworker feel if a male coworker she gets along with came up behind her and put his arms around her and whispered, ""you're so pretty?"
"third time’s the charm? 
So my boyfriend (m/20) and I (f/18) have been together since November, but have been exclusive since early October. We are both in college and involved in greek life. About a month ago, we start talking about a mistake I made when I was still dating my ex and how I wasn’t loyal, but I assured him that I would never do that to him and I love him way too much for that. He then decides it was the right time to tell me that at a bar event for his fraternity after a football game in the fall, he kissed his best friend (let’s call her “A”). We weren’t dating at this point because it was mid-October, however we had both already stupidly decided to lose our virginities to each other and so there’s no question that we were something more than friends, as we were hanging out every other day and texting. I was supposed to be at the bar event with him but I wasn’t able to go, and he had sat with me at the football game before it happened. I didn’t know how it didn’t eat him alive for 6 months and how he let me hang out with her closely without it bothering him. I really struggled with it and wanted to blame her, but decided I could ultimately forgive him if he distanced himself from her. He assured me it was just one kiss and he promised there was nothing else to the situation, no feelings involved. This was in early April. 

Fast-forward to last week (May 4), I go and catch up with a college friend that knows both of us pretty well, and she asked me how I was doing in regards to the situation, as she had heard about it from another friend. She then proceeds to tell me that she heard from her friend that A and my boyfriend were at his house after the event, and that she had feelings for him at the time and he knew. I called him and confronted him and he said that was all a lie and he doesn’t know why things were spreading like that. I again asked him if it was just a kiss and if he was lying about that, and he said, “no, you have to at least believe it was only a kiss”. In retrospect, I had a lot of intuition about something going on with them that I ignored the first time, and my intuitions were telling me that something wasn’t right again. I wasn’t going to ignore it this time. I brushed it off for a day and then on the next night I decide to tell him that my intuitions weren’t right and i’m anxious about the whole situation. He comes clean and tells me that she took him home that night and that they ended up making out. He assured me so many times it was just a kiss and tried to make me feel bad just the night before about thinking it was more than that, when in reality it was. 

I asked him when he first told me to be completely honest about the situation, as he had nothing to lose, and the rest of it didn’t come out until I found out through someone else. I’m not sure if I would have ever known the truth if I hadn’t hung out with my friend that night. I’m less hurt about what he did, but still am very hurt that I gave him the opportunity to come clean about everything AND a second chance, and he deliberately lied to me. I broke up with him because obviously I can’t trust him, and this is the worst breakup I’ve ever had. Regardless of what he did, he was still my best friend and probably the best relationship I’ve ever been in. I miss him so much and I didn’t want to break up with him but it was the only option. We’ve still been contacting each other even though we said we wouldn’t and can’t stay away from each other. I know I would look stupid for trusting him again but he really is sorry about it and has cried every day along with profusely apologizing, and I feel like part of me is missing right now. Part of me wants to get back together with him but the other part knows we need time away from each other to heal, and that it feels so bad because it’s so recent. What do I do?"
"Am I being crazy? So I've been friends with this guy for a few years now. We hadn't hung out in a while and I spent the night at his house (not in a hookup way neither of us are interested in each other like that. He's stated hes pretty much asexual and I have a boyfriend)

We both opened up about some pretty heavy stuff and I ended up leaving on the second night kinda withdrawn and overwhelmed. Not because of him, I just got stuck in my head since we were talking about direction in life and I got weird since I've been kind of floating aimlessly for a while after failing out of college. I left after that and it was kind of akward. 

Looking back I feel like I should have talked about how I was feeling and been a better friend towards him. Especially since I'm not rhe only one going through stuff. I've texted him a few times since and he hasn't really responded. 

I sent this after two weeks of no response. I just want to know if it comes across as manipulative. I've shut someone out before and had them try to make me feel bad for protecting myself and didn't want to do the same to him. I just genuinely want to know what I did wrong.

""Hey I don't know what day your birthday is exactly but you said it was like 2 weeks away. So I'm guessing it's near. I just wanted to say happy early/late birthday. 

Also if I upset you in some way I'm sorry. I'm sure you've been busy with school but just in case it was something I said, the last thing I'd want is to make you uncomfortable or feel like I'm a bad person to have around. I know I'm akward and talk a lot, and I'm not good at hiding my feelings but I do care about my friends a lot and I consider you one.

I hope you're doing well and if you've already had your finals, that they went well too!""

I quickly followed that up with this since I wasn't sure i,f he just wants me to leave him be and wanted him to let me know if that was the case. I know if I hurt him it's not on him to say anything to me. It would just be nice to know.

If for some reason though you really just don't want me talking to you anymore please let me know. I won't bother you. I just genuinely don't know what I did if anything or you are busy and am keeping up contact cause I don't know. It would just be nice to know what I did. I know you opened up about a lot and I shut down at the end of the night. I'm working through some stuff and I know you are too. I just got kinda overwhelmed and stuck in my own head. I feel like I should have been a better friend and I'm sorry I left the way I did. 

""Anyway I feel like at this point I'm bordering on harrassing you since I've haven't heard anything in a while. I'll just assume if I don't hear back that you want me to leave you alone and respect that. Either way I hope you're not dead or were kidnapped or something. If you're just busy, sorry for overreacting. And if it's something I said or did, I really am sorry for what its worth.""


Reddit do I come across as self conceited. I really don't know what to do and really don't want to lose anyone else like this again. Any advice would be cool."
"If I asked someone to hangout and he agreed but still hasn’t said when yet should I bring it up again? So I’m talking to this guy off tinder and lately he’s been seeming a bit more distant except yesterday he’s been messaging a lot more recently which is strange too. So like Wednesday I think it was I asked him if we were still hanging out this week and he said he wants to but he has to figure out whereas what to do (because things are just now opening back up where he is) 

So part of me wants to message him about it again because I’m worried if he is becoming uninterested or if somethings just going on that I don’t know about or what’s happening why he seems to be acting a bit different lately. But I don’t know if I should at something since I did ask him already last week?"
"Fuckup I totally fucked up. My girlfriends bday is very soon and I got a bit too talkative and pretty much ruined the surprise ive been planning for the last year, and she loves surprises. Well now she is horribly mad at me and totally ignores all of my calls, messages and everything. What do I do?? Do I leave her alone or do I keep on trying? I feel like if I leave her alone its gonna make it even worse. Does she need time? The thing is I cant even go to her or reach her any other way because of this lockdown. Im just lost.. shes been ignoring me for the past 2 days. Please help"
"I (17f) don’t know how to talk to my mom (50f), and she doesn’t know how to talk to me. It’s ruining our family and putting strain on both of us. *This was a preexisting throwaway, I didn’t make it specifically for this subreddit, so I apologize that it’s not a throwRA. Also I would like to put a warning because there is a heavy discussion about mental health in this post, which may be distressing for some readers.*

I am having a lot of trouble talking to my mom, and it’s putting a strain on both of us as well as our family. We have been fighting almost every day of quarantine. 

I am a 17 year old female. I do okay in school, take APs and honors courses, as well as volunteer work, publishing photos frequently in the local newspaper, and singing in a band as extracurriculars. I would consider myself to be a kind person, and I don’t cause a lot of serious trouble in my behavior. I do though, struggle significantly with mental illness. I am diagnosed with OCD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and some sort of depressive disorder, as it’s being heavily monitored to really understand what’s happening because as of now we can’t really tell if it’s MDD, circumstantial, bipolar, etc. I also frequently struggle with suicidal thoughts, to the point where I would have been hospitalized if COVID-19 didn’t shut down the facility. I am on two medications to manage it, and it makes it a lot easier. I have access to therapy. 

At home, I have felt completely abandoned. My mother knows about these issues, and knows the extent. She refuses to acknowledge it. If I am crying in my room, she never checks in. If I am missing assignment after assignment, she tells me I better start applying myself. I do not want to demonize her. She is a lovely woman, and she is nurturing- just not in that sense. Some of my friends have a difficult home life, my sisters friend lost her mom due to cancer a few years ago for example, and my mom has helped her work though issues with boys, drama, etc. One of my close friends has an abusive mother, and my mom has made it clear to him that if he ever needs a place to crash, he can always come over, no question. She is involved with the community, and does a lot for the school and for the town. Right now we are running a donation program for the food shelter. She is not negligent. 


I just wish sometimes though, she would give me that same attention. I wish that she would just let me vent to her, and listen, and not blame it on something exterior but understand that the problem is a chemical imbalance in my mind. 

But she doesn’t do that. 

She tells my sister that she thinks I hate her, that I’m her pride and joy but our relationship is terrible. She tells my sister that she feels like she failed me.

Her mother is a bipolar alcoholic, and she was very emotionally closed off. My sister and I have agreed that my mother takes that out on me the most. 

I went on a walk with my mom recently, and I told her that I love her, that she means the world to me- but I don’t know how to talk to her. I want her to listen, I want her to understand that I’m trying my best but I can’t deal with all of this alone. I want her to just nurture me- because right now I feel alone. 

All she said was “I’m sorry that I failed you”. We left it at that. 

I tried to remain as level headed as possible, and not guilt trip her but maybe my tone indicated that I was feeling sort of abandoned (?). I love her so much but I just feel broken. We’re fighting more and more every day, and I am getting to the point where I just have to accept that it’s not worth trying anymore. But this subreddit is sort of a miracle worker when it comes to human behavior, it seems, so I want to hear your opinions. If you have any questions, I will be very glad to answer. Thank you all in advance."
"Ex messaged first and then didn’t respond My ex girlfriend has been going back and forth over the past few weeks after breaking up with me. 

Although she’s done it a few times already, she made the *final* decision on Wednesday night that we were over and wouldn’t even be friends (I think she’s having a rough time atm). Since then, we hadn’t had any sort of communication between each other. 

Today, she messaged me saying “Hey I just thought I’d see how you are?” 

I responded “Oh right, I’m okay thank you. Hope you are too.” 

After this, she did not respond. Should I have expected a response? Why is it she may not have responded? 

Thank you in advance."

"Bag o emotions 

Please help me. I don’t know what’s happening lol, I was lead on after breakup


Am I wrong to feel this way?


Me and my ex gf are both 21 (i will be in 2 months) 

We broke up on the 3rd of April, mainly due to communicative issues. 3 days after our 1 year. 

She cited many of the issues we had, and acted cold and hateful towards me. 

During our breakup, she treated me terribly, I pissed her off because I wanted to make things work but she didn’t. 

However, after finding out (I think this is what happened) I started to move on (She told me to as well!) she comes back (I am talking to this amazing girl) and she’s telling me things like how she didn’t think I loved her and whatnot. I admit it, this girl was me getting over my ex, but it’s different I really like her, we click amazingly.

Anyways, 

She messaged me at 2AM last night wanted to talk about things. I told her fine, and we called around 10:30, and we talked for about 4 hours. 

She told me this at the *very end* by the way: 

She told me she initially called me to apologies (She treated me not the best during the breakup), and we caught up, talking about how things went down, what we could have done better, and how things could be better. 

She also exclaims to have *never* given thought to the idea of us getting back together, yet she entertains it? 

We started talking about getting back together, and it was going really well at one point, we were talking about our futures together, and how we’re going to hang out and whatnot over the summer.

However, after a while of talking, she starts doubting if it’s a good idea: she’s torn, and what’s to be with me, but content with being alone. 

She also said: she didn’t want me to move on, and she didn’t want to either. I didn’t want to move on either, but I thought it was over for good, so I started moving on. 

She started insulting the girl, saying stuff like: she’s not your type, she has weird tattoos and she wears pink? I’m not sure 

We keep going back and forth until she says she doesn’t want anything with us right now.

Dropping breadcrumbs like: maybe in the future when we’re both single, we can try again, but she doesn’t want to right now. 

She doesn’t want a relationship and wants to be alone, and it’s not you, it’s me.

She even said after I said I’m never enough, she said: yes you are, you are amazing. 

She told me I was a great boyfriend, and I was great. So no matter what, it seems like I’m not good enough? 

But she just wants to be alone. 

She strung me along, the whole time, saying she didn’t think the conversation of us getting back together was even possible.. but SHE CONTRIBUTED A TON TO THAT. 

She said she was sorry, but I kept my composure, didn’t cry, or yell, I told her how I felt: I was mad, and disappointed that she would do this to me. For what? Attention? I don’t know. 

She doesn’t want me to wait around on her as that’s not fair to me, and not to her either. 

Do I ever contact her again? Am I wrong to feel this way? I’m not devastated, I told her I’m really upset, pissed, annoyed and disappointed and I am, and basically hung up. Ending on her feeling bad, as she should for how she lead me on. 

I hope she’s not the one that got away :( 

Am I the toxic one? Am I the issue? Am I not good enough? I’m so very lost and confused right now. 

Any advice? I’m so mind ducked right now.

tl;dr : ex gf broke up with me out of nowhere, comes back after she told me to move on, wants to get back together, changes her mind, and doesn’t want a relationship."
My boyfriend has been back two days and is driving me insane! My(25f) boyfriend (24m) and I were separated for a month and a half due to quarantine. We had been together a few months prior to him leaving and we got along great and had a lot of fun. He called every day he was gone and everything seemed great. Now that he is back he is staying at my place because he lives in a van. I have found my self getting incredibly irritated by everything he does to the point I don’t even like him to touch me. I have tried to be introspective about why this is but I’m lost. Im not sure if it is just hard for me to share my space or what? It’s possible this is just an adjustment period from being on my own for a month. I am worried that I really just don’t like him anymore but nothing has changed in the time we were apart. Any advice on how to handle this would be much appreciated.
"Would you be mad? Would you be mad if you saw your gf and three of her friends bent over in three guys who idk.  They were turned sideways from the guys but still in front of them bending over.  Would you be mad if you saw this picture of your gf?

&amp;#x200B;

Some people dont know what I mean I mean they were all in a line in front of the guys (still close though) bending over each other with the guys behind them."
Is there a chance of getting my ex back? My boyfriend and I of 1 1/2 years broke up a little over a week ago. For the past 7 months he would tell me how he’s not sure if he sees a future with me anymore. After that point he started to put in little effort into our relationship. I kept going and trying for him because I was in love. I hoped that he would change. He broke up with me because he felt it was unfair for me to be in a relationship with him when he wasn’t fully in it and because he knows he wasn’t making an effort. He was amazing at the beginning of our relationship and I know we both saw a future. We had/have a special connection that is hard to explain and I don’t want him to just give up yet. I want to be with him more than anything. Is there a way or a chance I could get him to see what I see? Is there a way to get him to realize he needs/wants me in his life and want me back?
"Graduated in December and moved back in with my parents until I find a job, need serious help I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub. I don’t know where else to post.

My dad has been verbally and emotionally abusive to my sister and I since we were little. Now she lives about an hour away with her husband and i’m alone in the house with my parents. Things came to a head between my dad and I the other evening and I know I have to get out of this house before I do something drastic or go crazy. I don’t know what to do. There’s a god damn pandemic going on so getting a job is on hold (that’s what the fight was about- he is mad I don’t have a job right now. During a pandemic). My sister hasn’t offered to let me live with her and my other sister doesn’t have room for me. 

I don’t know what to do. I know I can’t stay here, I can’t be around him, I can’t look at him. I’m traumatized and I was afraid he was going to hurt me the other night. I have gotten to a point again where once I left the house after the fight, I was driving erratically because I wanted to get into an accident so I could go somewhere else.

Please help, I don’t know what to do. I can’t live here any longer but I don’t have enough saved to get my own place, especially during a pandemic when I have no job"
"Lie I told has caused issues So I told my current bf (20), who I (20F) have been with for almost 4 years now that I had a bf before him and I said it was some guy that went to my school for a while. This was very dumb and I did it when we were first getting to know each other because I felt lame for never having had a boyfriend.   


Over the years I never mentioned him (except for a few times in the beginning when he asked about it) but we had one big argument once where I ended up unfollowing this guy from my class. This was let's say about a year in, maybe less. 

Now, this guy follows me again and I follow him back not even thinking about it because he isn't actually my ex. My bf sees that we follow each other and obviously feels very betrayed. We are also long distance and so I guess that following this guy (who is supposedly my ex) didn't make him feel great.   


I tried to explain that I didn't do it with any bad intentions but I didn't admit my lie, and I feel like admitting it might completely end the relationship - since I guess he would see it as me lying for 4 years. 

Have I fucked up beyond return?"
"My gf is friends with her rapist on fb TLDR: it appears my gf was raped, but she still keeps in touch with the rapist.

I feel the easiest way to explain my situation is via a timeline, so here goes:

Sept 2018: I meet my now gf through work and we hit it off, quickly becoming very good friends. She has a boyfriend, which I accept and don't expect any form of romantic relationship with her.

Nov 2018: gf breaks up with bf temporarily and downloads Tinder where she starts talking to ""Bob"" (name changed)

Dec 2018: she agrees to a date with Bob, but the day of the date she texts him: ""where are we going tonight?"" She had bought a new dress and done her make up and was really excited. The guy texts her back saying he would rather just come round her house and have drinks there.
When she tells Bob she doesn't want to do that on a first date, he cancels.
Gf gets back with her bf.

May 2019: she again breaks up with bf, coincidentally Bob has surfaced again, and said he wants to take her out. Gf arranges to meet him at a bar at 7pm.
At 7pm, Bob texts her to say he was running late, but if she gets two glasses of wine he'll be there in a second.
At 8pm, same again, he claims he is on his way but tells her to get another drink and wait for him.
By 9pm she was very drunk, after about 6 glasses of wine, and calls him to tell him he missed his opportunity and she's going home.
He texts back instantly saying he will be there in 2 minutes and will drive her home so they can get to know eachother there. This time he does show up. Has he has never met my gf before other than online she was able to sneak out without him seeing her.
We were very good friends at this point, so she rings me and I pick her up and take her home. She tells me the story (all of the above).
A few days later I call her and ask her out myself, she agrees.
We go on several dates, two or three times a week.

June 2019:
Out of nowhere my gf texts me to say she is really upset and she doesnt think I'm the right person for her. I call her and convince her that I do want to be with her, and she agrees to another date with me. Note, at this point we arent boyfriend girlfriend, we had just been on a few dates.
A week later, she calls me in tears and wont tell me why.
I tried to find out, but there was nothing I could do because she refused to tell me.

July 2019:
In conversation with my gf, Bob comes up and she refuses to talk about him, looking upset when I mentioned his name.
Anxiety and worry got the better of me, and I looked through her texts with him.
In June, when she had told me she didnt think I was right for her and I had to convince her otherwise, she had messaged Bob and agreed to have a date round her house, knowing that they'll never meet otherwise.
She then send him a lot of drunken texts on the day they were due to meet, and dirty photos of her surrounded by empty wine bottles, and a text from him saying: I'm outside. Therefore I knew they had met.
Nothing was disclosed about what happened, but the day she called me up crying she also texted Bob calling him all sorts of foul words, telling him to never come near her again.

September 2019: I've asked her to be my girlfriend and she has agreed. One day when we are out, her phone pings and its from Bob. She didn't know I noticed.
I wasnt comfortable that she was receiving texts from him, and so later on I again looked to see what it said.
He had sent loads of dirty texts like: I know you enjoyed giving me a blow job a few months ago, why dont I come over and do it again. Her response was always no, but it was never aggressive like you would expect. 
I confronted her and told her I didnt feel comfortable with him messaging her and asked her to block him. Which she does.

December 2019: I come off Facebook as I never use it, Bob is still blocked.

May 2020: I come back on Facebook, and I see my gf has had several changes of profile picture in that time.
Bob has liked every one since March.
Turns out he is a mutual friend of my gf.

That takes us to today.

I'm a little lost, because I know this guy hurt my gf. And I know he is clearly sex obsessed and doesn't care about her feelings at all.
 I do not feel comfortable with him being able to contact her. He knows her address, and it's obvious he knows no boundaries. 

I've confronted my girlfriend, and she has gone back to refusing to talk about it when I mention his name.
We're in lockdown in the UK, so I havent been able to see her in 5 weeks. This has made me more anxious, because I want to know why she has added him, and what made her think to re-add him after several months. 

My gf says I should trust her, which I do.
I dont trust him. I dont want him anywhere near her, or texting her."
"A girl(19F) who I’m(19M) talking to has 1 red flag 
So this is the first girl who I’m interested in also seems interested me. She has 1 red flag where she will try and make me jealous. She tries to do it subtly but I wasn’t born yesterday it’s kind of obvious. Everything else about her from what I know is good is this something I should be worried about. We are only talking not dating cause of corona but we are gonna meet once this is over. She has reduced the amount after I told her to stop bringing it up. Idk if this is just how she is cause she isn’t sure how I feel cause I don’t wanna say I like her or any of that stuff till we see the vibes in person. Is this something I should overlook cause looks wise she’s  my type. personality is my type weird, funny and caring. We have a few common interests.

Tl;dr: Girl has 1 red flag which is trying to make me jealous should I still continue with her or is this a bad idea."
"My [m21] girlfriend's [f21] texting habits are affecting my mood So we've only been together officially for only 1 month, but dated for 6. Since becoming official though we haven't been able to see each other because of the lockdown.

Ever since I've known her she'll only reply to my texts around 3-4 time a day, sometimes only twice a day. This never really bothered me all that much, but now that we're together her habit hasn't changed at all and it's starting to bug me. I've asked her about it and she says she just doesn't check her messages that often, and I do believe her, she literally wont be online hours at a time before replying to me. But I just find it a bit ridiculous that she wont bother to look at her phone for a reply to a conversation we're clearly having.  

Idk, the lockdown is stressing me out not being able to see her, and it's hard for me to not be affected by her not replying for several hours at a time. Makes me feel sort of ignored. I feel silly for it but it genuinely puts my mood down. What should I do about this?"
"How can I (18F) help my friend (17F) with her insecurities? I’ve known her for almost 4 years now &amp;amp; she’s always been insecure about her size. She’s underweight so usually when she voices these insecurities, she gets the usual “you’re pretty! Don’t worry about it” which is super dismissive of her feelings. Her metabolism is really fast &amp;amp; when she eats too much she gets nauseous, so it’s really hard for her to gain weight. 

I know there isn’t much I can say to completely erase her insecurities, and I never want to be dismissive so sometimes I just don’t know what to say. How can I be a more supportive friend on this issue?"
"I need a prom date and have an idea of who to bring but am not sure if it’s a good idea or not So I’m a graduating senior in HS right now and the school I go to has rescheduled our prom, graduation and baccalaureate mass all for late July. I was kind of happy at first to know we wouldn’t have prom bc I didn’t know who tf to bring but now I have to figure all that out now. 
Everyone I was thinking of asking is in a relationship and I am not going to poke around in someone else’s business just to find a date.

Recently, I heard down the pipeline a girl I used to speak to in sophomore year is single. For context we weren’t dating or doing anything really serious bc we both kind of understood we were a little young for that but we were hanging out on the weekends and cuddling at friends houses. It was kind of a mutual relationship if that makes any sense. We kind of ended things off on a sour note at an after party for a formal dance she invited to. The reasons were pretty stupid and in hindsight the whole thing between was pretty dumb because both of us were so emotionally immature. 

It’s been 2 1/2 since we’ve spoken or even made eye contact with each other. I’ve seen her at a couple parties but we never acknowledged each other. We also go to different schools that are both single sex schools so its not like I could’ve seen her walking down the hallway or something. Anyway, I was thinking of asking her to maybe start hanging out or talking again in hopes of asking her to be my prom date. I’m not sure if this is a totally good idea or not. I feel like it could work bc it’s been a pretty long time and I like to think I’ve matured from when we spoke last but I’m just not sure. 

I know this is long and all sounds kind of stupid but I kind of need a little guidance on if this is a good or bad idea and if it is a good idea, how do I start a good convo?

Thanks"
"Is it right to say I wanted to leave? My boyfriend and I been together for almost 5 years. He has really a moody attitude but I can ride with it. For a few months ( where problems start) , he suffered from difficult problems. So even though he made something that upsets me, I disregarded it and says sorry all the time when I start an argument because of his actions. He often tells me that I need to leave him because he is enduring a lot of problems right now. But I did not, I was always the one who says sorry and fixed the fight. Then today, my feelings and emotions bottled up because  I was really upset. He didn't say sorry. He got mad. I said I'm leaving and he said okay. I'm really hurt and in pain right now because I love him. He wasn't like this before but he suddenly becomes like that for few months."
"My (22M) friend (22F) avoids me Ive known this woman for 5 years now. We have grown up in the same city and so we share a bunch of friends and interests. We used to be grat friends for like 3 years but for the last 2 years we have gradualy fallen out of contact and only kept liking each other stuff on facebook but not meeting each other. We also had guite busy lives for the past 2 years with studying at prestigious universities in different countries. 

With the ‘rona coming around I though I would nessage her and get back on track, maybe meet since neither of us has anything better to do instead anyways but when I message her she replies after like an hour after seeing the texts and tries to be as straight forward with the answer as possible.

I really feel like Im just bugging her at this point and she tries to reply after a long time to show me to let her be but I dont know why. Thinking I lost her for good makes me really sad. What should I do?"
"I (22F) keep fantasizing about cheating on my boyfriend (21M) and realised I'm bi after a year apart. Help! Let's call him 'Raj'. We've been dating for 3 years and have pretty much been each other's first everything. First person I truly loved, first person I've slept with, and he has been with me through the whole of my university experience. Because of this, we fell in love hard and have been talking about kids and marriage and all that adult stuff since pretty much the first month. It was pretty intense, but we've fallen into a slightly 'old married couple' routine.

We go to the same uni in the UK, and I decided to do a year abroad in Australia.  This means we have been together at uni for two years, and done long distance for this past year. We didn't even discuss breaking up, it was just a given that we were going to make long distance work. Since being here, I've come to terms with the fact I am bisexual. I had never considered it before, but my roommate ('Max', more on him later) brought it up in jest and it was like a flick switched inside me. 

I feel like I make a lot more sense now. I haven't told my boyfriend about it, and I probably won't until we're back in the same country and I can see him (so not until after lockdown). It has also come with a sort of sexual awakening. Obviously the distance isn't helping, since I've basically been celibate for a year. But, I keep thinking about how much fun university could be if I were single, and if I'll regret being tied down in what has been an uneventful and slightly boring relationship.

This is where Max comes in. It's just been me and him in the flat since quarantine. He's the opposite of Raj - confident, conventionally attractive, social. I know he isn't overly sexually attracted to me, but we have chemistry. We have kissed before, just the once and at pride. We were both very drunk, and I also kissed one of my other friends, but there was a live photo of the kiss and we both seem very into it. We also joke about the sexual tension between us and about how much we look like a couple. I keep fantasizing about sleeping with him. I definitely would not want to date him, but a drunken 'mistake'? I would take that. I think this is more of a case of being locked away with a fit guy whilst getting zero action, but still. I feel guilty about fantasizing about someone other than Raj.

Breaking up with Raj isn't going to be easy either, since we are contracted to live together next year. And I don't even know if I do want to break up with him? I just want to go out and have some wild nights with some people, boys and girls, and see what happens. 

Like I say, me and Raj haven't talked about it. He knows about the kiss, and we talked it through. I said it was purely platonic and that it was a short peck. This was a small lie, because it was platonic (in the sense that i just wanted to show some love to my friends), but it lasted longer than what I made it out to be. He was not very happy when he found out though.

I also haven't thought about Raj in a sexual way since being here. He is overly sexual in a childish way, and just sends dick pics when he's bored. Our sex life is okay back home, and he is very caring. But he just doesn't excite me anymore. I'm rarely in the mood when he is, due to the time difference, and I feel like he stretches the cyber sex out for far too long and always wants to hear the same boring things over and over again. I've brought this up before, but we always seem to revert back to random dick pics, the word 'willy' and a lot of 'heh's when we're sexy talking.

It's all very confusing for me and I don't know what to do. I won't see him again till September, and I return to the UK soon, so the Max thing will be over. I still do love Raj, but this distance is really wearing me out. But I can't get this nagging feeling out that I'm wasting the time that should be fun and wild by being in a committed relationship that isn't exciting for me. But like I say, it might just be that I haven't gotten any in literally a year. Am I missing out? Should I embrace the sexual awakening? Any advice would be great."
"Am I wrong for being angry ? My boyfriend (M35) left me (F24) alone to have an abortion to go to his daughters (F7) friends birthday party. 

We decided to terminate the pregnancy ( he really doesn’t want another child and already has two )

When we arrived he was extremely irritated and I asked why ? He said that he wanted to attend his daughters friends birthday party with his daughter because he wants to jump around and bond with her. He also wanted to help her pick out a present because her mom was going to get a cheaper end gift.

We switched to a medical abortion so it will be quicker for him. But it still took a couple hours. I took one pill at the facility and had to take the second one to induce the miscarriage at home. 

I needed to get a heating pad, pads,pain meds ect but he just dropped me off at home and left. I didn’t have any of these things prior.

I went through the pain alone for 3 days with insane cramps for 2 weeks. Alone. I did voice how I felt to him and he said “ I will never feel guilty for putting my child first”. This did hurt me. I thought comparatively that what was going on with me held some level on importance.

During the first few hours he kept sending pictures of him playing at the birthday party with the kids.

I understand that his kids come first but I asked him ahead of time of there was anything on his schedule of the day and he said no.

Am wrong for being mad?"
"Boyfriend [30 M] said I [27 F] am unintelligent Okay so here's the thing, sometimes I speak in abbreviations, and on Tuesday I asked my boyfriend something about a situation ""IRL"" and he made a really ugly face and said ""what's wrong with just saying in real life"" and then we had an argument, and didn't speak until this afternoon - I initiated conversation because I really started to miss him (we live together).

Anyway we start talking and the argument came up, he then said that it shows signs of un-intelligence when I speak that way instead of saying the full thing because it takes the same amount of time.

I have always been this way, I have always spoken like this, saying ""BRB"" when I need to leave a conversation or whatever for example. All my friends love me for who I am, if they don't understand what I am saying, they will laugh and call me a millennial - they are never rude or mean to me about it and just know how I am.

It really hurt when he said what he said. I am not going to change, I like me the way I am and I only speak like that when I am really in my happy space, just being who I am, feeling safe and mischievous.

Am I unintelligent? Was he mean? He says that I use what he is saying as constructive criticism and change the way I speak so I don't sound unintelligent.

He just started a new job and is stressed, maybe he is being mean because of that,

TL;DR Boyfriend said I am showing signs of un-intelligence by speaking in abbreviations, such as BRB or IRL. Feeling hurt, I don't always speak like this, only when I am just hanging out with people that I feel safe with."
Me (17m) and my girlfriend (17f) We chose our dorm rooms and they’re right next door to each other and she was really excited about it. Is this a good or bad idea what if we break up and we are stuck next door to each other I don’t think we will ever break up but it’s still a thought my friends told me it could go really good or really bad and would just like advice I’m kind of scared
"Need some brutal honesty I’m an 18 year old female. I’m not a girl that’s used to any attention really...until my boobs grew fairly rapidly when I was 15. Almost overnight, I had boys talking to me and wanting to get my attention. At first, i was really flattered and didn’t know how to handle it so I made some stupid decisions. Lessons learnt to some degree there. 

Here’s the thing, and as I’m asking for brutal honesty, I’ll give some too. I know that I’m not the prettiest. I know I’m not the sort of girl that would get attention were it not for having big boobs. What I’m really struggling with is being able to work out if a guy actually likes me or if he’s just after the same thing the others have been. 

I feel stupid just writing all of this. Has anyone got any suggestions on things I can do to protect myself a bit more and work out whether someone may possibly like me for me? It’s a bit deflating in all honesty and I’m not really sure what I’m expecting from this. 

Thanks in advance"
"I just don't know how to tell him He's such a good friend, and closest I've gotten to anyone in a long time. We have a chemistry that is unexplainably good, we have similar values, similar desires, hobbies, communication styles and romantic ideals, yet we're just really good friends. We have the best adventurous days and nights - but we're just friends. We have really sweet moments but we're just friends.  Everything has us as just friends. We're just roommates, yet you can hear us laughing and dancing in our living room from miles away. We may disagree at times but we always talk it out as civil as possible. We learn from each other, we grow. Our house is a vibe he says, a vibe. I wish he could feel my heart twisting and turning, but I'm so afraid to tell him how I'm feeing because I don't think he has ever been attracted enough to me, I'm not his ideal type and he wasn't mine until... I saw his heart. 

He keeps showing up in my dreams unexpected. I can't take this much longer.. My fear of rejection and track record of unrequited love is absolutely holding me back to expressing any part of how I feel. I don't know what to do or what I even want. Truly I love him as a friend and believe we could continue on as just friends, I want him happy and loved by anyone who sees what I see. Love is more than just what I want. But something is tugging at my chest that I can't control and I don't know what is going to happen. This quarantine is going extremely well for us because we have each other. But I've lived with best friends before and this has definitely been my favorite experience, and the extra time together doesn't help.

Any advice?"
"""Text me in a year and we can try again"" My ex is a wonderful person and the feelings I have for her , I never had for anyone else in my life.

I did my mistakes , I'm a mess and that's not hard to figure out , I regret it all , for me , I lost who I love the most because of my own damn stupidity.

This creature showed me what true love is , softened  my heart , it felt like a dream and I just happened to find her , the shit I did to keep her close only pushed her and when I am in the path of bettering myself she told me to give her time and that she just wants to forget and that she doesn't want to give up on me.

This person was my source of happiness when I was feeling miserable , when I talked to her , my failing life was just a speck of shit on an otherwise perfectly spotless window that was the beautiful way she made feel.

I can't count how many times I looked at myself in the mirror and wondered if she would like to see me like this and that got me through when I was feeling like absolute garbage.

This night we didn't sleep (she didn't , I fell asleep at 5) and she told me that I shouldn't worry about anyone appearing in her life because ""no one's replacing me"" , she is just so wonderful and I wish that we can be the happiest together again , she also told me that ""if you really really need me , text me , I'll respond"" , I love her with all my fucking power , she helped me evolve so much and the one I called my person is still the one I could never give up.

Everyday since the day I met her I've been thinking about things that I never think that I'd be going through , but the only thing I regret was me being so shitty , I love her the most.

I hope that after ""this year of grace period"" I can show her that she meant more than anyone else ever did , that everytime I wake up I'll be able to look at her pictures and smile again , and after a shitty day of school that she could be my source for happiness , again.

I will be miserable and beat down this period , I can't even try to get someone else because I know they'll just be a replacement for her that I don't give a single fuck about.

I hope she takes care of herself and that after this ""break period"" I can reedem myself and be the highlight of her life like she was and still is for me.

Can I ever be enough for her , worth her time?"
"Breakup My girlfriend (23F) broke up with me (26M) after 3.5 years of dating. She said I need someone more invested in me, since she is not an overly affectionate person. I think 2 people with different love languages can make it work. She said she wants to stay friends, as we were truly each others best friend. I would like to end up back with her but I can't let that be my only hope.  I wasn't perfect and wish I could change anything wrong I did. 

I feel like quarantine strained us, she broke up by saying that after over a month of quarantine, she didn't exactly miss me like I missed her. I can't tell if she's apathetic towards me, or life overall. She deals with bad OCD and anxiety and easily stresses about us.

I'm not exactly sure what my question is, I'm just depressed and feeling lost right now."
"My [22M] girlfriend [22F] opened up about her physical and sexually abusive past and I am questioning the relationship. Will try to keep it short but please read the entire post not just the title. 

Have been dating her for about 8 months and things have been rocky.

She hasa lot of issues with co-dependancy, anxiety, attention seeking behavior, and is not good at taking criticism.

Myself, and my mother who I talk to about my relationship problems both figured she just had immaturity issues and will grow out of it.

Today she opened up about her past, about her physically abusive mother, and how she was raped in high school by an older man from bumble.

I am seriously questioning the relationship now because she seems to think she has moved past all of this, and that she has come out the other side good enough. This makes me scared because I now know that those issues are not related to maturity, but related to her seriously abusive past.

I love her and don't judge her for what happened. I don't think of her as damaged goods. I want to help her move past this. But I don't see how I can be in a relationship with somebody who doesn't want to get help with stuff as serious as this.

She did one year of counciling in high school about the abusive mother and never told anyone about the rape. Says she doesn't want to talk about it to anyone and just forget about it.

What do I do?"
"My [25F] boyfriend [26M] talks At me for extended periods of time. My boyfriend Nathan and I have been together for 6 years and have lived together on and off for about four (we had to go long distance for a couple years while I finished school). 

Nathan and I are in related but ultimately different fields--I don’t wanna say exactly what it is, but imagine he’s a journalist and I’m a poet, or he’s a pediatrician and I’m a physical therapist, or he’s a history teacher and I’m a math tutor, similar enough that we have a good understanding of what each other does, but different enough that sometimes the other one just won’t Get something small or nuanced about a topic.

Since we have both been working from home, he has taken over the home office and I’m stationed in the living room, and he can take breaks every so often, so several times a day he comes out to talk to me. Well, not to me. At me. Sometimes he’s venting about a situation I’m familiar with, and once I’m able to get a word in edgewise, I will express sympathy and offer a suggestion. He will say it’s a great idea, and then complain about the same thing again every day for the next week saying he has no idea what to do about it. Sometimes I’ll ask him if he’s considered taking my advice from earlier, and he looks surprised, and it’s clear that he had completely forgotten my contribution on the matter. I’ve told him many times that this hurts my feelings, that if he just wants to vent, that’s okay, but if he’s coming to me about a matter I have a personal understanding of, it’s going to make me feel like he’s not listening to me if he totally ignores what I have to say.

The things I can offer advice on, that’s one thing, and I’ve expressed my feelings about it. But there are things about his job that are completely foreign and frankly totally irrelevant to me. He will come out of the office, interrupt me while I’m working, and launch into a long-winded story about an interaction his coworkers had just now, or monologue at me about something that I couldn’t possibly have an interesting response to anyway, I’m talking like 10-15 straight minutes about how the website he writes for is changing fonts, or the gender makeup of his class this semester and isn’t it interesting that there are 5 boys and 10 girls in AP History this year but last year there were 10 boys and 5 girls… on and on, oblivious to the fact that I am in the middle of focusing on something, oblivious to the fact that I don’t have anything to say about the merits of Garamond versus Cambria, etc. 

I have tried everything I can think of. I told him we could have a code word for when one of us has been talking for too long, that either of us can use if we don’t have the mental space to be involved in a conversation anymore. But I think I’m just struggling with the fact that I feel rude asking him to stop, and I can tell it hurts his feelings. I mean, is there any nice way to say, “This isn’t a conversation, this is a monologue with a captive audience who didn’t buy tickets in the first place”? Am I just a horrible girlfriend, should I just let him talk about the fonts for as long as he wants and nod along?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend monologues and I don’t know how much I’m supposed to put up with."
"Brother wanting too much attention from my boyfriend during quarantine. What do I do? So since quarantine I've(19F) been staying with my boyfriend(23M). We've been together almost a year now. He lives with his parents and his brother(28M). Its just a lot better staying here with more company and things to do rather than my room at a relatives that's in a basement with no natural lighting. (Boring and depressing) however the main issues arise here with my boyfriend's brother. His brother is clearly worked up in the quarantine, bored out of his mind. And that means he always wants to do something, go out and take a drive, play games, get food out somewhere, anything. But it gets to be much sometimes and my boyfriend doesnt always want to do things with him, he likes doing things on his own a lot too. But his brother is super pushy to get him to hang out with him, he'll find any reason and excuse to why he should hang out with him, that HE'S the one being a bother not hanging out with him. Like it's my boyfriends job to keep him sane and not bored. He wants to be included in everything. But romantic relationships are so much different than sibling relationships. We wanna have things to do just on our own too. Not too long ago the brother got really upset about something, like he felt like he was being excluded. Now, my boyfriend isnt the greatest on communication, which can sometimes lead to others feeling hurt or thinking something differently. But overall it feels like we try to include him on a lot, try to make him not so bored. When my boyfriends communication doesnt go right I try to fill in to make his brother feel better and not feel ignored. But still apparently it's not enough. After the brother got really upset my boyfriend went in to talk to him. And I could hear it from the other room and it was just awful how stubborn and pushy his brother was being, yelling too. Just all excuses and reasons again, being upset that it doesnt feel like my boyfriend wants to hang out with him, that they're family, he needs to be there for him etc. Everytime my boyfriend would try to say something reasonable he would talk over and deny it. I could hear the frustration in my boyfriend, I dont know how he put up with it. And while the brother won't say it directly, I know he blames me. He would say things like "" ever since she's been in your life you dont hang out with me as much"" and he says things like ""I get it, shes your girlfriend.. but still"" trying to soften the blow. Hes only said something along those lines to my boyfriend a few times that I've heard, but I know hes holding back on how he feels about me. Hes always really nice to me, and I to him. But sometimes I feel like it's just a coverup.. I mean it makes sense in his mind to blame me and be upset. He wants to hang out with my boyfriend, but well girlfriend is over now. And if boyfriend doesnt wanna hang out, it must be the girlfriend that's saying ""no! Dont leave, stay here and hang out with me!"" But in reality he really just doesnt wanna hang out.. hes usually just doing his own thing and I'm doing my own thing. Sometimes I would even tell him to just go hang out with him so he's not sad. It's honestly just been a big stressor. I just wanna enjoy staying with my boyfriend and live life but everyday I also have to think about what his brother is gonna say. I understand the stress of being in quarantine and being bored and lonely. But that doesnt mean you need to steal someones attention by force all the time. If someone doesnt wanna hang out, accept it and find something else to do. His brother really feels a best friend kind of relationship with my boyfriend, but my boyfriend has told him he just doesnt feel the same. But he just won't accept that response. I've been feeling more and more off lately by the brothers feelings, I can just tell with everything he says hes mad that I'm here, wants me gone to have my boyfriend all to himself. He's clearly jealous. I just dont know what to do about it. I've been thinking to just have a one to one talk with him to clear the air and have things be okay between us. But it just feels awkward. And he's like 10 years older than me.  I dont know how to go about this, or if I should just let it be. What should I do?

TL;DR: I'm staying with my boyfriend and his family during quarantine. But his brother is super pushy on wanting all his attention, he clearly blames me for my boyfriend not wanting to hang out with him sometimes. It's really awkward and a big stressor. How should I handle this?"
"Am I (21M) thinking irrationally regarding my 5-month relationship with my boyfriend (18M)? Hi, so I'm not sure what to think about my relationship with my current boyfriend. We met in November, started dating in December, and everything has mostly been fine. There have been no issues between us so far and we like spending time together. However, I find myself constantly getting in my head about little details and worrying about my boyfriend and his feelings for me.

I am a very touchy and affectionate person in a relationship. I like to be physically close to my SO, compliment him, kiss him, tell him I love him, etc. But my boyfriend is not the same. He enjoys time together, but rarely compliments me or tells me he loves me without me saying it first. When I try to have an engaging conversation with him, he usually replies with something sarcastic and doesn't actually answer my questions or try to carry on the conversation. Most of our time together consists of him being on his phone (he's big into social media) or (currently) playing Animal Crossing. I understand that with COVID and quarantining, there's not a lot we can do. However, I like to keep myself active and regularly suggest we do something fun like go for a drive or go on a hike or *something* besides just laying in bed and watching TikToks. He's usually never interested in doing things like that unless it's his idea.

So what I'm trying to say is that he often doesn't reciprocate in our relationship. I feel as though I would go out of my way any day to make him happy, but I don't feel he'd do the same. He tends to do whatever is convenient. However, I'm not sure if this is entirely valid just based on our time together. He's sweet, nice, funny, and is genuinely sympathetic when I feel down about something. When he does reciprocate affection and love, he makes me really happy. When he doesn't, I wonder if I'm wasting time with this relationship. I just don't know if I'm exaggerating my thoughts about the situation. Are these things that warrant breaking up our relationship? Am I wasting my time with someone who rarely gives back? This is my first serious relationship, so I don't know if this is just normal relationship behavior or if I should be expecting more.

TL;DR: I am usually more affectionate and giving to my boyfriend than he is to me. I'm not sure if our time together is just normal relationship stuff, or if I'm valid in expecting more from an SO."
"I [39 m] am struggling with my past sexual issues 20 years later, and its affecting my relationships. TLDR: 

For the past 20+ years I have been labeled a sex offender. I've had to have my picture taken yearly, and  report to the police whenever I move or get a new vehicle. In the past 5 years, I have successfully petitioned the courts and gotten myself removed from the sex offender registry so I no longer have to report. I completed all the state guidlines and successfully rehabilitated myself, but now am struggling with sexual issues with performance. 

Background:

For those of you who want to know why I was on the sex offender registry, let me summarize. When I was 20, I got into a relationship with a girl. I had invited her and a few of my friennds out for a midnight release of a popular movie at the time. Apaprently she did not tell her parents this because when I drove her home after the movie her parents had locked her out of the house. She stayed over at one of my friends houses and I went home. The next day I took her back to her parents house and they told her she could not come back. We eventually moved in together and formed a relationship very quickly after. It was a lot of sex. We also had a lot of arguments and issues. Every argument we ever had was always ""solved"" with sex afterwards. It was a very unhealthy relationship and tottally not the way a relationship should be. After one of our typical arguments, I initiated sex, because that's what we did...we argued then had sex. She was responsive at first and everything was going normal until she turned away after some touching to the vagina. I stopped what I was doing. Asked if everything was alright. She got dressed without saying anything and left. At the time, I didn't feel as if I had done anything wrong. I always felt like because I stopped when I noticed something, I didn't do anything wrong. The police, when they arrested me, didn't see it that way. I had touched her inappropriately and without her consent. It didn't matter that I stopped. The fact I went that far was a crime equal to a rape charge in the 4th degree.

I went to jail and wanted a trial. But things didn't go well in jail. I was beaten and forced into solitary as a form or 'protective custody' for a period close to a year. Eventually I just wanted out of jail and plead guilty to the charge. I had to wear a GPS bracelet and had a curfew of 8pm. I was monitored at all times. I was put on a sex offender registry with rapists and child molesters. I was convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the 4th degree, a felony.

I was made to think that what I had done was wrong through sexual rehabilitation counclers and the victim advocates committee. And maybe it was. Either way, the entire experiance had a huge psycological affect of me, and I didn't become involved in another relationship for many years.

Current Issues:

I struggle in the bedroom when it comes to sex. I always feel as if the entire act of sex itself is something wrong. My body reacts positively but I can't seem to break these mental barriers. I often times loose my erections, and sometimes have complete mental breakdowns while trying to have sex. I have no issues masturbating alone, but as soon as someone else gets involved I have issues again. I've been with several partners since this has happened and often make up for what I lack with strong cunnilingus skills, but often times that isn't enough for a sexual partner. They say it makes them feel unwanted and that I might have erectile dysfunction. I find it hard to communicate properly with new sexual partners exactly why I act the way I do, but often find that once I can trust a partner and have a conversation with them about it that things seem to go better but I still struggle. I cannot climax with another person, even if I'm doing it myself. 

What I've done to try and get help:

As a male struggling with sexual issues isn't fun or easy to talk about. Finding low cost or sliding scale counclers isn't easy either. Many want you to have some sort of insurance or a decent paying job. Having being convicted of a felony, I need something free or really low cost. I've looked into groups such as 1in6 and that seems to be for survivors of sexual assaults. I don't know if I qualify for a group like that. I've tried going to meetings like A.A. but often find that they have too much religion involved in their core and don't focus on these types of issues. 

Performance enhancing pills seem to help, but they also affect my heart very negatively. I haven't tried any testosterone pills yet, but was considering giving that a try. I have tried online counseling through sex crisis centers, but again do not feel as if I am in the right place. It always feels wierd to talk to advocates against sexual abuse when you are a convicted offender.

As mentioned above, I have successfully completed all the state guidelines to have myself officially removed from the sex offender registry, which is a huge weight off my chest. This was both the hardest thing to do but also the best thing I have felt has helped me. 

I do not know the right group or place that I can become involved with to break down some of these mental barriers. I also do not know for sure if any of these issues are a direct result of age. 

Questions:

How can I get past these issues, and what options are available to me when seeking help? Do any other males struggle with issues similar to this? I feel alone and as if no one can really relate. How can I undo the mental brainwashing that sex is actually ok to do?"
"I am not sure exactly what to do here, or to think, help out? I basically was at my girls house yesterday and we were just hanging out no big deal, she calls me into a small room that I basically never have gone into, kind of like her little office space I guess, and she has pictures of her friends and stuff on one of the walls, it has a picture of her ex on the wall? I went to the bathroom right after to think and am I overthinking or is this actually weird. She had another occurrence before where she felt the need to text him cause something she posted “might make him feel bad” I’m just like worried I guess, someone help 🥺"
"Straight male S/O moving in with a female My boyfriend is really wanting to move out, and he messaged me saying that he might be moving in with a girl he knows from high school, my first instinct was a complete heart drop, and i reacted in a cold nature and became closed off. I want him to be able to move, but I know it would hurt me to see him constantly around another girl. He has other options with male roommates, but he just told me he might go with this option. It hurt me that he didn't ask if i would feel comfortable with it. And I truly believe if I were to move in with guys he would be very jealous.  

What are some ways I can go about this in a healthy and mature way?
How would you feel about this situation?
Was my reaction normal? And what could I do to correct if it wasn't?
Is there ways to set up boundaries, and are they needed in this situation?"
"I’m very confused at the minute (m17) So I have been friends with a girl for at least a year and a half now and I always knew I sort of liked her, I have asked her about us being in a relationship multiple times, only a couple of days ago she said she had feelings for me so I was quite happy however I knew she is in a relationship and since she has told me how she has really felt she has been talking to me less, I need to find out what I can do and if girls often get distant after admitting to their feelings for you.. thanks"
"I [M24] feel like shit for developing feelings more my friend [M20]’s ex girlfriend [M20] I am a university students, as are my friend and his ex. At the beginning of this year, in early January, my friend and his ex broke up after being in a relationship for 3 months. I’ve never really had anything to do with his ex except one or two odd conversations when I was around at my friend’s place (and I want to say here already that I never fancied her in that way during their relationship, I hardly knew her anyway). About a month or so after their break-up, me and his ex kept bumping into each other in the library which I didn’t think much of as assignments were due in that period.  Over time we got into conversations and we would still bump into each other in the library, randomly on campus, and even once in the city when someone visited me. We developed a friendship and that was all it was to it. I did find the friendship weird at the beginning and who wouldn’t because of the relationship with my friend. I did talk to a mutual friend  and housemate of my friend who said it was not weird to be friends with her and if ever anything were to happen that I should first ask for permission and respect the answer no matter what it is. I never had the intention for this to happen.

Now here is the tricky part. Since lockdown begun in my country, I ended up chatting more with her (on the internet of course) and we have been in contact every day since, sometimes even video chatting. I don’t have many friends and the ones I do have generally do stuff with others so I kind of naturally leaned towards my friendship with my friend’s ex as sort of a leaning point during the lockdown. Now however, I realised that I’m actually always looking forward to talking to her or even just having her on video call as background noise whilst working. We sometimes even fall asleep while on call. I’ve realised that I am developing feelings for her and I feel like crap over it. I would never have imagined that I’d ever develop feelings for any of my friend’s exes. I don’t care if a friend’s date another friend’s ex as I grew up in a small country were such a thing was bound to happen due to the small population and dating options. The country I’m in now however, does not have that problem. That’s why I feel like shit. I know I shouldn’t have developed feelings for her but it just happened and I certainly didn’t try for it to happen. 
What am I do to? Should I give it a try and ask my friend for permission and see what he says, if it’s negative, I’ll obviously not act on the feelings.
Or should I just give up on it and if so, how?


Tl;dr: I am growing feelings for a friend’s ex of 3 months who broke up 4 months ago. I didn’t plan that to happen. What can I do?"
"Why can't I be sexually attracted to the love of my life? I'm (34 F) who used to be dating (44 M). We were together on and off for over 5 years now. We used to be horrible at communication, which sunk some of our relationship over the years. However, as time passed, and we grew into each other, we learned how to overcome a lot of our issues. We became each other's best friends and confidantes, and we can spend whole entire days wrapped up in conversations with each other.

We are so alike in many ways, and different exactly in the right places. The one place that we have never been able to fully connect in, however, is the bedroom.

Sure, we had great nights - but they have always been few and far between. I am into BDSM - and he is not. He is willing to learn, but after 5 years of our sex life not being the greatest (regular sex once every month or so near the end there), I needed a break because I kept craving BDSM and needed an outlet.

Why didn't we talk about it? Part of our problem was ignoring the giant elephant in the room. Part of it was me trying to talk to him about it last year and him refusing to because he thought that would break us up (while I thought us not talking about it was the reason we were).

Fast forward to this great guy I met who is into BDSM and can deliver. We definitely are not the soul mates that this other guy is to me, but for the first time in a very long time, I can enjoy sex. And it's an addiction, it's wonderful. I haven't ever been this happy with my sex life in my whole life.

However, it's not everything. I missed my ex so incredibly much. We weren't talking anymore, understandably so, and that intimacy of knowing someone's thoughts and being on the same wavelength just wasn't present in this new relationship. 

This COVID thing has really brought out the worst in my impulses, because my ex and I haven't talked since January, but I wanted to see him so badly, and this other BDSM guy and I did not survive the COVID crisis relationship-wise (though we still see each other from time to time). Newly single for a month, I decided to hit up my ex, and he wanted to see me.

And I cannot feel sexually attracted to him at all. At all. We kissed when we saw each other, we stayed together for hours catching up and being close to each other. God, we have everything else. Except for that.

He wants it but is respecting me for not. And then he'll get drunk to try some BDSM, but it doesn't work because he's out of control with it and doesn't know how. He says I have to teach him, and I would be willing to, but don't I have to be sexually attracted to the guy first? Is it because we did so much damage over the years of not talking about it that now it's too late? Is it because I'm still seeing BDSM guy and need to let that go before I start? Is there any chance whatsoever of us overcoming this hurdle, or are we torturing ourselves by clinging onto something that everyone else around us has told us is dead in the water? We don't want to listen to them because they don't know how we feel, but what if we are both too stubborn to see it? But still, what if this is the love of my life, and I'm letting him go because I can't figure out this one simple thing?

Why can't I be sexually attracted to the love of my life?"
"How can I fuck with my ex for going on tinder? My(f21) ex(m22) of one year randomly stopped investing in our relationship at the start of last summer. He went from being an amazing boy friend to extremely cold when we were long distance for school. Because of this I was pretty much forced to break up with him. 

Two months ago we he begged to have a chance with me again. I don’t have feelings for him anymore so I told him we can just see how it goes. I’ve been busy and haven’t given him much of my attention, but he’s been acting like we never broke up and doing everything to win me over. I finally was starting to crack and talk to him a like him a little more, when he made some comment about not having talked to any other girls since me. I told him it’s fine if he has, it’s been a long time and even told him I dated someone else. He got mad and kept insisting he hasn’t used tinder or talked or slept with anyone since me, which is just weird. 

I wanted to see if he was lying so I logged into my cousins account who looks very similar to me and found him pretty quickly. He matched and messaged me back in literally two minutes some stupid pickup line. I even asked him again if he was lying while I was tinder messaging him at the same time and he again swore up and down that he would never lie. 

I don’t have feelings for him so it’s not that big of a deal, but I am mad because now I’m almost convinced he had to have been cheating on me when we were together. He seems very invested in this conversation with me over the fake tinder. What’s a good way to mess with him? I know he is very much into real me too as he’s constantly trying to talk to me. I don’t want it to be too involved because I want to stop talking to him after today because I’m genuinely disgusted by him now."
"Did I (23F) make the right decision to block this girl (adult, specific age unknown) TLDR at the bottom 

Hi everyone.

A couple of days ago, I commented on a public post, giving general pointers about recognising phishing and scam emails.

The girl who posted it added me. Since she's my friend's fiancé, I decided to accept and get to know her. Haven spoken much to that friend as I've been talking to my closer friends and people I see at uni and more regularly.

Once this girl and I began to talk, things went south fairly quickly (at least to me). She asked if I could be her best friend, which I was happy to as long as I got to know her. She was baffled by the concept of getting to know each other. After toxic friendships in my past (one fairly recent), I really have to get to know people before jumling into really personal and emotional discussions. It's just how I like to do things now.

She was confused by me wanting us to get to know each other, spammed me with six messages per one of my replies... And within an hour, asked me if I would like to be her son's auntie.
I reiterated that I really want to get to know her and be given time to digest things as things were moving at lightening speed. She, in all caps, wrote back ""I SAID I WAS SORRY""

At that point, I blocked her and sent her fiancé (my friend) a message, as I was sure that she would rant about me blocking her to him. Aside from explaining that things were going way too quickly and her not giving me space to think about things (figuratively and literally, sending me bunch of messages after another) and asked if she should see a psychologist as this behaviour may actively be pushing people away from her (as she said she had no luck in friendships). I told him that I don't think that I am the right friend for her at the moment. 

Did I handle this situation well? Any advice?

TLDR: girl (friend's fiancé) spams me with messages, goes from wanting a best friend to me being an auntie to her son in about an hour and gets angry that I want time to think. I block her and inform my friend that I don't think I'm the right person to be his fiancé's friend at this time"
"How do I deal with a toxic bully sibling? I (18F) have a younger brother (16M) who makes life absolute hell. And I know that 'all siblings' fight but this is different. 

Firstly, he physically assaults our autistic 6 year old brother when he thinks no one is looking (i.e. shoving, kicking, the lot) and says it wasn't him. I don't get the physical side as much but he verbally abuses me, about my weight, my skin, my grades and medical conditions. The words are extremely hurtful and ignoring him only makes him worse.

Then there's the microaggressions; breaking the lock on my door, stealing and hiding my things (or alcohol), compulsively lying and tormenting our youngest brother when I'm trying to calm him down to make my job harder. It has come to the point where I will no longer allow to be left alone with him because it will frustrate me to no end and I risk being injured. All of this is unprovoked, no one will say anything or do anything negative but it doesn't work. It has brought my mum to tears and my parents relationship is suffering from it.

Despite his violent behaviour, he will become incredibly jealous of my relationship with our brother and will force affection from him, such as saying he won't give him a toy unless he gets 'kisses and cuddles'. It is uncomfortable to watch him force affection from a child, even hugging him when he doesn't want to or physically kicking me out of their room and closing the door when I'm doing his routine so he can do it.

He has recently gotten a scholarship to a prestigious boarding school (with a padded application and grades only as good as mine) which has turned him even more insufferable. He has told our parents he hates them and can't wait to leave and told me he got his grades on his own because I was too dumb to help (not only did I give him my notes and tutor him, his school plan to 'help' his predicted grades to get him in). It's disgusting to hear him talk to our parents like that after all their help.

My parents agreed with me that he may need to see a psychiatrist. I was sobbing so maybe they said it to appease me but I truly believe it would benefit all of us, him included. Unfortunately, we're in quarantine, poor and he is going to boarding school in September. We're worried his behaviour will only get worse if left unchecked and with boys who might encourage it.

He has 'good days 'but they're more like good hours until someone doesn't give him what he wants and it starts again. He was sent to a lot of sports and had quite a bit of attention when we were younger so maybe that's it.

Could anyone please give me advice on how to deal with him? My family assume it's attention-seeking behaviour but it's really tearing us apart and I'm struggling to imagine maintaining a relationship with him as an adult."
"Confused Boy I’ve been seeing some one for 3 months no.  She’s so beautiful and on paper is so great and sometimes makes me so fucking happy.  We’ve broken up twice now.  Each time we end up kissing within 36 hours.  We’re currently “broken up” but still involved and exclusive.  This relationship has provided so much good to my life but has also broken my heart multiple times.  I’m sure we’ll get to the point of getting back together sooner or later.
Also I haven’t been able to keep my eyes off other girls.  
All of my friends are against it because they’ve seen the heart break this whole thing has caused me and don’t want it to happen again.  
I’m just worried i’m looking through rose colored glasses making all the red flags just look like flags. 
Does anyone else have experience in such a relationship."
"Idk how to tell my [20f] little sister [8] I am moving out. I need some advice telling my little sister I'm moving out. Me 20f and my little sister 8f are incredibly close. This girl honestly means everything to me.

My moms emotionally abusive so when I turned 18 I moved out. I told my sister the night before and then everyone else afterwards. She took it really hard and didnt talk to me for half a year understandably.

I have some medical issues I have to go to the hospital for. I went there and as a result moved back with my mom. It hasn't gone well and I need to go back to the hospital so I'll be going to the hospital in another state and moving there. 

How do I tell my little sister in a way that wont be terribly devastation for her?"
"My [36M] roommate [33M] constantly plays his music in the common area First off to sum I need someone to tell me if I'm being unreasonable at the end of this or not. I know myself well enough that I sometimes, can be picky. But I have a pretty good common sense perspective in general.

My student roommate and I are having to live together in a small 2 BR apartment during the pandemic. For awhile he would write papers and sit in the common area (kitchen, close to my bedroom) to a mildly annoying volume of classical music for 4-5 hrs a day. I don't care for classical music. I don't care how much people find it soothing or whatever, it eventually can get on my nerves. To give context, this is also the same guy who cooked full blown Martha Stewart type meals until 12 am all last fall right outside my door essentially every single night while I worked a 9 -5 until I spoke with him. 

So any way I asked him a couple times to turn down the music hoping he'd get it. So he shut down a week or so ago and just stopped playing music in the common area all together. But then I sensed his emotions and what have you getting flung around the apartment so got sick of it feeling that projection onto me. So I told him yesterday I don't mind if he plays a ""little music"" but that I just don't wanna hear it for hours at time. This was originally my message when asking him just to turn down the volume time after time.

Low and behold he's been in the close to my room common area playing his music for the past 2 hrs at a low volume. It fades in and out of my room but if I try and rest my head in peace it just plays along my mind and is annoying AF. 

What's the next move here? I don't wanna have to wear earplugs all day. And I'm sick of investing money to compensate for the little things around here."
"Insecurity once relationships become more serious, can anyone relate? I’ve (24F) been dating my partner (34M) for about 7 months now, we’ve already discussed living together, the future of our relationship, etc. we’re very open and communicative however, I feel so insecure! I don’t know if it’s our age gap or if it’s just me but even after he asked me to move in with him/talks about our future, I still have doubts! 

I do this in a lot of relationships, when the fun of the first few months starts to transition into a serious loving relationship I get SO scared. Scared my partner will leave me bc we’ve gotten too content, scared that the more they get to know me the less they will want to be with me - even when they don’t give me any reason to feel this way! 

How do I stop this negative mentality and move on with my relationship??"
"Me (M24) living in a female household of mom and sister (30). Difficulty balancing chores and responsibilities. My family have always been very pragmatic, clean, responsibility-oriented. I have a been a little different. I'm emotional, I get tired more easily than them (I'm just overall more sensitive and aware of my body and emotional state), and cleanliness is not a top priority (my life outside of my home is more organized than my home, I work, I study, I take care of my self etc). There have been points where I lived with roommates and they were DISGUSTING in terms of how dirty they were. So I knew that I'm not a pig (at least according to my mom and etc, not trying to disrespect anyone who lives differently, just my mom's standards). Anyways I woke up late today and they reminded me of stuff they asked me to do today. I've just been out of it today, and honestly, I didn't want to do it because of how tired I was. They really got angry and just blew it on me. 

I really just want them to leave me alone. I'm not their slave. If they like to keep the house clean, let them do it. I don't think that's me being lazy, I help in my own ways. It's not my responsibility. I'm trying to make my boundaries. I think I've made my decision. But can anyone explain why this is? Why is there so much anger from them about cleaning the house? It's  ridiculous and honestly imo a little toxic"
"My bio father has received a letter from my college but refuses to give it to me or my mom, wth do I do? So as the title states he got a letter and won't hand it over. I have made it very clear that I do not want contact with him, I don't want him to have anything to do with me and I want him out of my life for good.

I've not spoken to him since January and my mom and her boyfriend have spoken to him numerous times to try and get him to leave me alone because he would spam me constantly with messages and calls and he thinks I have mental problems because I don't want to see him, it got to the point I was having nightmares and had to bring it up in therapy, now the therapist has said that if he tried anything further she would get social services involved (she hasn't already because my mom was counting on him being reasonable but he wasn't) so I'm going to tell her asap but I was wondering if there's anything I can do to either get the letter or get him to stay out of my life for good?  

Note, this is not a situation where I'm ""being a typical teen"" I really really do not feel comfortable around him (he's done other things but nothing really serious) and wish he would just let me exist peacefully"
"I (25/m) feel extremely guilty &amp; selfish about having having feelings of wanting to break up with my (29/f) amazing girlfriend 2+ years ago, I met this girl.  We vibe well, she has an amazing sense of humor, our physical intimacy has never been a problem, and I have since fallen in love with her.  After 3 months together, we were saying I love you.  After 4 months together, we were moving in together (happens that we were both outgrowing our current apartments), so we split rent for a new one together.  Everything in this relationship has been organic and flowing, which is what I think we both love the most.  We’ve never had a chemistry problem.

It’s not perfect.  Like all couples, we have problems, some big, some small.  Among the big problems are (from my perspective) lack of deep emotional intimacy, lack of things that we like to do in common, etc.  We seem to compromise on a lot of stuff: where we’ll go for vacation, what we’ll do over the weekend, even when to wake up 😄.  

But we have good things too...our home life is so calm and easy 99% of the time that it feels like this is “the perfect girl” if someone were to look at us from the outside in.

The biggest problem is that: I feel like even as perfect as this girl is, and as amazingly as we get along and even her family accepts me and mine her, I feel like something is missing.  Maybe even just me having time to explore and get to know myself.  I’ve only really been single 1 year of my adult life, and I’ve never been the one to break things off in a serious relationship.  And I can’t help but feel like a selfish asshole.  This girl loves me damn near unconditionally, and here I am thinking “I wonder what I’m missing”.  Not only that, but I’m very scared that if I break it off, she will (a) hate me for a while and (b) I risk never finding someone with whom I have this much calm and ease.

I’ve brought up not wanting to live together and spend some time apart, but she made it pretty clear that if that happens it wouldn’t really be worth it for her to continue.  And I feel like every time I tell her I’m having second thoughts - it’s happened a few times - we end up negotiating and she convinces me how good things are.  And it’s because I feel torn in 2:  half of me really does feel like “it’s that good” and “wtf am I doing trying to break it off”.  The other half feels like I seriously need some alone time and to figure my shit out, grow, continue to date around (I still find myself yearning for other women - but I guess that will never go away 🤔).  And even though I feel “safe” in this relationship, that’s probably not the best reason to stay with someone.

At this point, I feel like I lack the conviction to be fully in or fully out of the relationship and it is honestly exhausting.  Am confused and would greatly appreciate an outside take on things.

ps: just the other day I had a thought that I’m so busy looking for a good reason to end things, but maybe wanting to end things is reason enough to end things.  I just can’t get past my fear that I’m fooling myself and she’s actually perfect for me and I’m just not grateful enough and I’ll regret it."
"How to help my gf(f22) with her not being able to focus on her school work(m21) I know how bad it sounds but the problem is that we both have college work that we do online but when it comes to actually doing the school work she spends a couple hours just looking at her phone and most times will finish up the day with only 1 part of her homework done. I feel like bringing this up to her will get her mad because she has told me that she is insecure about her phone and everything done anyone have any advice

TL;DR: my gf of 1 1/2 years how to focus on her schoolwork"
"Fighting (f29) with my BFF (m28) over my career? 

I’ve been fighting with my boyfriend over my career a bit. Since I work in finance I often have to
Be around other men. I am also working ridiculously long hours and I’m asked at all times of day to do stuff (from
Home of course). Anyways, last night one of the Vice Presidents called me, because I had found something cool in some research I had done and shared it with a female co worker I’m friends with and she shared it with him. Our day was ending around 7 pm and he called me and asked about it because he thought it was cool too. He often makes jokes with everyone in the office and he was friendly to me and asked more about my background in school and what I had studied. I’ve been being told by him
And by a lot of people in upper management I’m doing really well and I’m hoping this will lead to a promotion. My boyfriend doesn’t like that these guys are friendly to me, and he says I am
Overly friendly back. When in fact I KNOW I do everything I can to cut conversations short, I don’t reach out first, I don’t start conversations that aren’t about work, I might laugh but only awkwardly
Because I don’t want to be rude to higher ups, i don’t make any jokes back, I even. Report back to my boyfriend any time I even have to speak to a guy. I don’t know what to do he says I’m
Phony and over friendly when I have to speak to any other guy or any clients, but how I see it is I am just trying to be professional and not IGNORE people when they speak to me. I’m concerned this is going to ruin our relationship I don’t know what to do. He says hurts him so much that I don’t shut these guys down completely, but they aren’t flirting with me, I have to talk to them for work, and I don’t go out of my way to make conversation with them. If they speak to me I try to respond back friendly and professionally but definitely not overly friendly at all. What do I do"
"Me (19 M) and my friend (28 F) are in a really rough spot in our relationship and I don't know what to do. I know that title doesnt really explain much, but I need help.

So, where do I begin? Ive known her for about 3 years now and I met her online. We were a part of this group that somehow managed to stick together for a long time now. Which I am immensely surprised by, and grateful for their company. These last few years have been some of the better years thanks to them. However, recently we've hit a snag.

This friend, who we will call Emily (stereotypical ENFP for those who care) has been what I would consider to be my best friend during all of this time. We would spend hours talking with each other, playing games, just enjoying each others company. She's incredibly talkative so we would have much to discuss. We've both talked about our personal lives, what our fears are, etc etc etc. Its a rare time for me to talk about my personal life, so I trust her a lot. Recently I've been able to open up more, but she was definetly the first. However recently, there's been some issues that have come up.

So we have some other friends who have come in to join this RP server of sorts. Mostly for DND which is great. Its been going great so far, but a campaign came up recently that she wasn't interested in, which is fine, no issue for me, we all have our preferences. But she decided that she wanted to play as the villain. Okay? I mean that's interesting, and this particular arc was meant to be an introduction into a whole new universe (usually wed play in a normal dnd setting, this was for vampire the masquerade which is dope as hell) so I really didn't have an issue with her being a the villain. Neither did the DM. So everything was cool. However, towards the end of the arc, she was starting to get mad that her character wasn't getting to do much (and to my knowledge, she had been explained to her that her character was going to be limited because our characters are meant to go onto later arcs, THEN we have the right to die XD). 

But, this kind of thing has happened before. Normally once the issue is behind us, she will adjust and things would be back to normal on all sides. That's what I counted on here, I do my best to support her and comfort her when she gets upset, but sometimes I know when things need to just run their course. But, someone new made a joke about her being salty when she started complaining. So she left the RP server. Just like that. Everyone was pretty shocked by that. This all happened when I was at work and couldn't really respond immediately, which only made matters worse, because I couldn't comfort her initially.

When I got back from a rough night at work, I spent the next like 5 hours or so trying to calm both sides down and talk to each side and maybe even mend ties. I tried to be the peace maker. I wasn't going to talk trash about either side, because I love both sides. However, someone from the other side PMed me about all of this, and I pretty much broke down. 

This entire situation has made me realize how much stress the relationship between me and Emily has put me through. She seems to constantly need attention, compliments, validation or what have you. She talks, constantly. And I mean constantly. Me, being introverted and reserved by nature, doesn't understand this and frankly gets exhausted by that very quickly. The amount of times that I will join the chat at 1pm to have her IMMEDIATELY say ""hey did you see this thing I did?"" For something that she said like 5 hours ago in the chat that I definetly did not see, is uncountable. This doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but when it's been happening for 3 years, it starts to get on your nerves a lot. It feels like she's testing my loyalty in a way, if I didn't see it, I'm a bad friend. If I did, good boy points I guess. Maybe it isn't actually the case, but it sure feels like it.

Not only this, but she will get mad blow up to immense proportions over what I consider to be tiny little things, but to her are not. While i would spend the next hour to 2 hours trying my hardest to calm her down, dropping pretty much everything.

Here's where all of this can be put on me and everything here would be my fault: I am, by nature, complacent. I am complacent to tell others what is wrong to not hurt their feelings or cause unrest. I simply can't do it. Especially not with someone who will just explode this easily. This complacency has been a huge problem for me for a long time. I pretend that everything is fine, everything is normal. This could go from talking about my internal feelings about things, to things that really need to be addressed. I am not denying that. I don't explicitly LIE to others about things, but I am guilty of spinning things to not be as bad as they think they are, or omitting heartwrenching details. Sugar coating is probably the best term here. I intentionally don't trash talk anyone just to comfort someone, but when I have to because nothing seems to be working (this all happens in private DMs btw), then I feel extremely guilty about it afterwards

I have been quieter in everyone's chats ever since this came up, maybe about a week. I'm trying to process everything and stay a bit quieter, while Emily moves at the speed of light like she normally does. And I feel that me being quieter is starting to get to her a little bit. She understands that I'm more reserved, but I don't think she likes it all too much. In her mind, dead silence is worse than any insult, even if the silence doesnt last very long. One of her outbursts was because someone wasn't very active, so I fear that one against me is going to come up very soon. But I need time.

Sometimes I feel this relationship is taking more from me than it is giving. I'm trying to keep this post as concise as possible because this is already getting extremely long, so I'm probably accidentally leaving a bunch of questions which id be happy to answer if asked.

 I just don't know what to do from here. I would hate to just separate from her, I think shes amazing and I don't want to go through with that. She might have faults, but whether or not these outbursts and neediness are intentional or due to a mental health issue is beyond me (although I have many suspicions that it is the case). I don't want to abandon someone in their time of need, but I fear that I'm unintentionally doing so from my complacency and inactivity. And how much of this can be put on me? Some? All? None? I don't know. Thank you so much for reading all of this.

TL;DR
Me and friend have hit a rough patch due to friendship drama, me realizing how taxing this relationship is, and the problem of my complacency has hurt more than it has helped I feel. Just confused where to go from here."
"Bought my ex 36 roses in an attempt to say “I’m sorry, please come back” So for some backstory, I overreacted to a lot of stupid things and she got sick of it. When she left I did exactly what you aren’t supposed to do. Make threats to have her charged with things if she didn’t come back. 

It’s been almost a month and I need her. Because of the Canada/USA border closure I can’t get to her. But I ordered 36 roses (the purple/pink/orange ones with the purple vase from 1800Flowers) and they’re set to arrive Tuesday. 

My friends say it’ll work and one even said “she’s dumb if she doesn’t come back”. All girls. (Ex knows I am more feminine and is fine with me primarily having friendships with girls rather than guys. I’d rather talk about makeup and hair than guns trucks and beer)

Do y’all think my friends are right? If you had to guess is it likely she’ll come back?"
"My(28f) Bf(31) constant phone use was damaging my mental health. For months I had been asking him to not bring his phone to bed. Sometimes he wouldn’t and I was so happy and we would laugh and hangout and I could go to sleep feeling secure in our relationship. But these times were few and far in between. When he would have his eye glued to his phone laying next to me my chest would tighten my eyes would well up and I would turn over and try to sleep off the what I previously thought was irrational pain that overcame me. Over time I became very resentful and i started making jabs at his tech addiction which would cause fights. It would bleed into the morning. Where I would make my coffee with tears in my eyes. He is a gamer so a lot of time is spent on his computer which I can handle but I just need that little bit of time at night. He couldn’t understand my need for alone time without distractions. My definition of quality time. It began to feel like a chore to him. Which hurt me even more. No one wants to feel unimportant or not worth their SO’s time. My pleas for his full presence felt unheard and was making me so depressed. Finally I googled “am I irrational for getting angry at my bfs phone use” and I found a scientific study about ‘phubbing’. I told him I was done nagging and I just wanted him to listen one last time. I read the article outloud and he finally heard me. He apologized for causing me pain and that he wasn’t purposely or maliciously trying to hurt me. Through the words of others he finally saw that it was truly causing me real discomfort. This isn’t really a post seeking advice. I just wanted to tell you my story and hope you aren’t ‘phubbing’ your partner. We all want love and affection from the person we have given our hearts to. We deserve to feel heard and have our partner be fully present. Today I woke up still a little sad but with hope for the future. If you have this problem don’t let it fester. Bring it up. Talk to your partner.  

Here’s a good article if you have a very logical partner like mine and want to share it:

"Would a short break/holiday like this appeal to you? It’s been a reoccurring thought; but would you ever enjoy a short one-week getaway where you and a significant other are butt-naked on a secluded part of a very hot 🥵 country/island.

Not meant as sexual question, just two people naked as the day they were born living that way for 7 days, secluded.

.....or am I just a freak 😬

Thank you for your time."
"Me (21M) don't know what to do about this 'friendship' with my friend (20F). I need to know what to do with this person I like. Due to the fact I have severe social anxiety and depression I mostly talked to people online. I've only ever been on a single date in my life and it didn't lead to anything. I met this girl on a specific subreddit and we started talking after I messaged her happy birthday drunk because she left a post that it was her birthday. She actually replied telling me I was cute and wanted to talk more. The next day we just messaged each other for, no joke, 5 hours but it was because it was engaging and fun. She said she wanted to talk more and we did, I then asked for her number and she gave it to me so we could message each other on our mobiles.

The connection came from the fact we were both struggling with addiction. I had started drinking and smoking again and she was doing the same. I think I was only able to keep up with the conversations because I was drunk and I wasn't scared to talk to her. We shared this really personal connection and it felt really nice. At a certain point in my life things got really bad. I overdosed on my medicine with intentions of never waking up. I wasn't really feeling anything when I did wake up and nothing happened but it lead to the next series of events which kind of drew us apart. I was going to the doctors like every day as advised by my college since I was living on campus. I decided to go home to spend the week but then I got really depressed and tried to kill myself again. I was then admitted to a hospital for a few days where I had no reception at all so I couldn't message her. I wasn't messaging her anyway because I was just so lost within myself and my emotions. I wasn't really thinking about her but she kind of was about me.

When I left hospital I noticed she had messaged me a few times wondering if I was okay. I told her everything that happened and she said ""you deserve a good life (my name)"". It made me feel good that someone told me this because I don't have many friends, only one but our relationship is different. Again we started messaging but they became shorter and shorter until one point I stopped messaging and so did she. It kind of took a lot to move on considering we shared a lot of the same things but most importantly our pain. I think this is the main reasons I didn't want to keep talking because she reminded me of the time I had and it was really bad for me. I wouldn't say she encouraged my drinking at all but I couldn't talk to her without drinking. I needed to drink to talk to her because that's how it is with everyone nearly.

Sad yeah but I slowly moved on. I think it was a friendship but at times it felt more than that. Like we had more of a friendship and had it not been for distance we would probably be together. She just messaged me the other day asking if I was okay. She said ""Oh my god you're not dead what's up"". I messaged like 2 hours later because I went to go smoke some weed and I was really high. I messaged her back but she didn't respond. I was hesitant to message because I didn't want to carry on with that friendship anymore and because since then I have ""changed"". I just don't like reopening wounds because they just lead to more messes.

What should I do in this situation at all? Am I wrong for not wanting to continue? I'd like to continue but I just find it so hard. I also hate falling in love because i'm such a loner."
"Quarentine straining relationships My bf (M28) and I (M25) have been together a while.  He lives with me.  He's between jobs so I'm working, but right now I'm working from home.  

It feels like being in the same space 24/7 has been a bit of a strain on things.  I love him, but I need to talk to other people.  I need to be somewhere else.

I am going back to work at the end of may.  I am s person who needs fresh air and sunshine, and new environments.  My bf is the type who can stay in the apartment for weeks playing videogames and not care.

I'm hoping that the discontent I feel is just with this quarentine, and not with my relationship.  

Is what I'm feeling normal?"
"What advice could you all give me ? I'll split my situation into parts so its easier.

1. Well, from the beginning. In June my ex girlfriend broke up with me because she said she didn't love me anymore. I was very sad because it had been a 1 yr 9 month relationship so evidently that's a nice, long time. The problem is that on that day I got sent a screenshot from a friend showing me her profile on tinder. Well the break up stemmed from that. I couldn't stay quiet so I sent her a text asking her why she has a profile and she said she had created it a week prior just out of curiosity. My memory fails me but to sum it all up I surprisingly didn't have any hard feelings. She initiated the usual unfollowing in social media and I noticed and I told her no because regardless of what happened I still considered her very important in my life and didn't want her out of it. Was I weak? Who opens up tinder while in a relationship? Should I be more mad than I showed?


2. Well, this is the part where I talk about MY mistake that I'm not so sure how to feel about. Fast forward to early August, j was bored one night and I download bumble the dating app. I swipe right on everyone to see what comes up and to my surprise I matched with a girl that I recognized. Well, this girl went to High School and is friends with my ex. I have this girl on snapchat so I sent her a message asking her if we matched for real or if it was a joke. She said she swipes right on people she knows. We got into talking and she said she would date me if the situation were different but she doesn't mess with friend's exes. I asked her how she thought I looked and she said I'm pretty attractive. Well I asked her what if we got some ice cream and we did. That's all fine until we start making out. The next she tells me how she feels like a bad friend and a bad person for doing that with me and all those things. Around the weekend she tells me how she told my ex about it because she didn't want to lose her in her life and because she felt too guilty. Well I noticed a change abruptly because my ex blocked me on her phone and her WhatsApp and snapchat. Since then, I messaged this girl again asking her if she made me look bad with my ex and she swears she told the story completely including how she held me back a few minutes because she was enjoying our kisses. I have tried to message my ex to tell her I'm sorry and all this nice stuff but it won't work. Considering she was on tinder behind my back, what's my position on apologizing to her? I was single when that happened and her friend is also guilty. Why would you think she blocked me? Another friend told me she didn't need that kind of toxicity in her life? Thank you"
